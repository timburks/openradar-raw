    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nToday it is not possible for a server based game to easily update a player's highscores and achievements. Instead the server often need to send the results to the client which in turn sends the scores/achievements to Apple using GameKit. \r\n\r\nThis is both a technical hurdle as well as something that helps cheating.\r\n\r\nI suggest a scheme where a server can receive a certificate to upload and access scores pertaining to a game.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSuggested flow:\r\n\r\nSending highscore/achievements\r\n1. Player finishes a server-based game, or unlocks an achievement.\r\n2. The server sends the score or achievement on behalf of the player, using an apple issued certificate encoded with the app.\r\n3. The high score / achievement updates on apple's servers.\r\n4. The server may now inform the client that the achievement / highscore has been submitted so that they can be refreshed.\r\n\r\nRetrieving highscores\r\n1. Server sends a request to an apple server for top highscores using an apple issued certificate encoded with the app.\r\n2. The top highscores are returned.\r\n\r\nRetrieving highscores\r\n1. Server sends a request to an apple server for top highscores using an apple issued certificate encoded with the app, giving the player id.\r\n2. The unlocked achievements for the player are returned.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis would create interoperability with other platforms, which is important if there is a desire to see games on Mac/iOS use GK as their base. Without this functionality, GameKit becomes a secondary system to which you push information to but never synch from.\r\n\r\nIdeally, expand GK as a platform-independent service, but then make sure that the top features are only available though GK. Basically I hope you can make stuff like OpenFeint redundant."
