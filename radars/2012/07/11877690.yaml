    description: "15-Jul-2012 08:54 PM Rusty Mitchell:\r\nSummary:\r\nAdd a geofencing setting in the Settings application so that the user can have cellular data disabled automatically in certain locations such as home or work where a reliable Wi-Fi connection is available. Cellular data should be reenabled automatically when leaving these locations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have seen continued, unexpected cellular data usage during periods of time when at home or work when a reliable Wi-Fi connection is available. This is contributing to my wife, who is on a 200 MB data plan, consistently going over her data limit each month.\r\n\r\nIf cellular data was disabled and reenabled automatically based on location, this could help a lot of users attempting to avoid unforeseen data overages.\r\n\r\nSee this discussion on Apple's Support Communities site with over 490,000 views for additional user frustrations around data overages. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2450738?start=0&tstart=0"
