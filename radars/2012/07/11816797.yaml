    description: "06-Jul-2012 09:52 AM Boris Buegling:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn the light of the recent problem with corrupted App Store downloads (http://www.marco.org/2012/07/04/app-store-corrupt-binaries), it is more apparent than ever that users need to be able to restore the data of individual apps from their backups. If the data of one app is somehow lost, the only remorse for the user is a complete restore of the device, resetting all his data to an old state. Therefore there needs to be a way to restore the data of a single app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDelete one app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nReinstall the app and restore its data from a previous backup.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe data is gone for good unless the whole device is restored from backup.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis problem exists since iOS 1.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n-"
