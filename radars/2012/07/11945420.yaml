    description: "I wish we could optionally eliminate the @ prefix for Objective-C string literals. It seems like in most cases the compiler should be able to infer when an object is being expected and do it for me automatically. For example:\r\n\r\nNSString *str = @\"blah\";\r\n\r\nThe (NSString *) is right there! It should know! I should be able to say:\r\n\r\nNSString *str = \"blah\";\r\n\r\nLikewise, for the new dictionary indexing accessors, they only accept objects so it should be quite reasonable to convert what looks like a C string into an NSString automatically so the code looks better:\r\n\r\nNSDictionary *myDict = [NSDictionary new];\r\nmyDict[\"key\"] = value;\r\n\r\nrather than this:\r\nmyDict[@\"key\"] = value;\r\n\r\nwhich, IMO, looks ugly."
