    description: "Summary: moving the insertion point with the arrow keys while pinch-zoomed in Safari doesn't redraw the insertion point' position\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, go to a webpage that has an <input type=text> or <textarea> in it, for example the Radar page that I'm typing in right now.\r\n2. Enter some text into the text region.\r\n3. Use trackpad pinch-to-zoom to enlarge the page. This bug doesn't present when you use old-style Command-plus to zoom in.\r\n4. Use the left arrow key on the keyboard to move the insertion point to the left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blinking cursor will move according to the traditional rules of arrow key navigation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor stops blinking, and then doesn't budge when the arrow keys are pressed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTesting in latest stable Safari in Lion (didn't chekck the version), and this bug is not present.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAfter moving the cursor with the arrow keys, if you start typing, the text appears where the cursor would have been if it had redrawn each time you hit an arrow key. The cursor position also updates if you zoom back out or change the zoom level."
