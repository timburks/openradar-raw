    description: "17-Jul-2012 10:57 AM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: When one uses Xcode's \"Test\" command to run unit tests, it it triggers both the \"Testing starts\" behavior and the \"Run starts\" behavior, along with all the other Testing and Run events. This makes it impossible to define a behavior that you want to be triggered only when the \"Run\" command is selected.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to define a new set of events, \"App Launch starts\", \"App Launch pauses\", \"App Launch generates output\", \"App Launch completes\", etc., which are triggered only by the Run command, and not by the Test command.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
