    description: "After reading this topic https://devforums.apple.com/message/677053, I came up with a little test;\r\nExporting a PDF document from TextEdit makes it 'unusable' for TextEdit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open TextEdit\r\n2. Create a new document and type something in it\r\n3. Select 'File -> Export as PDF...' from the menu\r\n4. Select Where -> iCloud as destination\r\n5. Click on save\r\n6. Select 'File -> Open..'\r\n7. Select the 'iCloud' tab\r\n8. Select the PDF that's been exported in step 5\r\n9. Click 'Open'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe raw source of the PDF file is shown, because TextEdit does not support PDF. A bit further testing show that TextEdit is actually allowing any kind of file to be opened from the 'open' dialog, also on the local filesystem.\r\n\r\nOn the local filesystem, this is not a 'real' problem because the files are still accessible via their 'native' applications, however, in iCloud, documents are only accessible via the application that created them\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\nThere is a workaround. To open the PDF document in 'Preview':\r\n1. Open TextEdit\r\n2. Select 'File -> Open'\r\n3. Select the 'iCloud' tab\r\n4. Drag the PDF file to the Desktop in order to move it from iCloud to the local filesystem\r\n\t-> A dialog is presented;\r\n\t\t\"Are you sure you want to move \"[filename]\" from iCloud?\r\n\t\tMoving the item out of an iCloud Library will also delete it from all your other\r\n\t\tsynced iCloud devices.\"\r\n\t-> Click 'Move'\r\n\r\nNow you're able to access the file via Preview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo single answer, some options come in mind, either:\r\n- TextEdit should be able to open all document-types that it's capable of creating\r\n- TextEdit should not be able to Export PDF files to iCloud\r\n- Preview/other Apps should somehow be able to access other application's files (how to restrict this, keeping 'sandboxing' intact?)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA document can be saved to iCloud, but not opened without technical knowledge / workarounds"
