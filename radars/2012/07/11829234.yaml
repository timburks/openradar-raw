    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAs Cocoa Developers we are encouraged where possible to use the Objective C APIs instead of lower level technologies.  I recently began a sweep through my code to replace some GCD code with NSOperation/NSOperationQueue.\r\n\r\ndispatch_async calls to the main queue are easily replaceable with [NSOperationQueue mainQueue] but where dispatch_async is talking to one of the global dispatch queues it seems to be impossible to create a drop in replacement.\r\n\r\nI have to create an NSOperationQueue instance somewhere even if it only exists to queue a single block.\r\n\r\nSince NSOperationQueues are wrapping GCD queues I had assumed I'd be able to do either:\r\n\r\n[NSOperationQueue globalBackgroundQueueWithPriority:NSOperationQueuePriorityDefault];\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n[NSOperationQueue operationQueueWIthUnderlyingDispatchQueue:dispatch_get_global_queue( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PROPRITY_DEFAULT, 0)];\r\n\r\nto give me a Cocoa wrapper around the global queues.\r\n\r\nThese APIs don't seem to exist, but something like them would be lovely to have."
