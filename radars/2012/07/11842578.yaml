    description: "10-Jul-2012 03:47 PM Yang Meyer:\r\nIn iTunes Connect, allow uploading .zip files for screenshots. Screenshot-compatible files (i.e. correct file format and dimensions) would then be added to the screenshot list, until it has reached its 5-screenshot limit.\r\n\r\nThis would save me hours of tedious work, especially when uploading different screenshot sets for each metadata localization.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Apple] Engineering has provided the following:\r\n\r\nYou can use our Software XML feed to bulk upload screenshots, as well as automate updating other app metadata. \r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found in iTunes Connect (Manage Your Apps page footer) on the Software XML spec and how to deliver using Transporter, and the 2013 WWDC session for \"Whats new in iTunes Connect\" includes more information on this as well as a demo."
