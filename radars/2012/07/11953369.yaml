    description: "25-Jul-2012 01:23 PM Lucas Neiva:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nChanging the content offset so that the currently visible cells stay visible even when the row height changes  during rotation seems broken.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch the sample provided in the Simulator or on any device (See \"notes:\" for how to recreate the sample project).\r\n2. Scroll to the bottom of the table view so that row 58 is at the top of the screen.\r\n3. Turn the device to landscape and back to portrait.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nRow 58 is still at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe table view has jumped to row 31.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe calculations are correct, since setting the offset at a later time (after the rotation) brings the table view to the right location. The table view seems to override the offset during the rotation.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is that the offset correction works above row 30. So rotating while cell 12 is visible for example works fine.\r\n\r\nThe table view should be able to do all those calculation by itself. Why do I have to tell it to change the content offset anyway? It knows how tall the rows are and should be able to see the change and keep the cells visible, right? Maybe I'm overlooking something.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nhow to recreate the sample project.\r\n1. Set up a UITableViewController that return a bigger cell height in landscape than in portrait.\r\n2. Try to keep the cell that is currently at the top visible when rotating the device by changing the content offset of the table view content offset."
