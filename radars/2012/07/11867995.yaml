    description: "Summary: When tab was accidentally closed it is useful to be able to reopen it by a simple hotkey.  Sometimes more than one tab are closed accidentally.  Unfortunately, Safari doesn't provide any way to restore all accidentally closed tabs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  Close more than one tab. Type Command-Z or click on menu bar item Edit => Undo Close Tab. Try to invoke Undo more than one time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: All closed tabs are restored.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Only one closed tab can be restored."
