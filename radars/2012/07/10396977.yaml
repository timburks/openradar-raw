    description: "04-Nov-2011 12:34 PM Dave Murdock:\r\nSummary: \r\nI want window positions and sizes saved dependent on the number of displays available and the arrangement of these displays. I work at the office with my laptop hooked up to a Cinema Display. Once I disconnect the laptop form the Cinema Display, all my windows are put back on the laptop display, as expected. When I come back and hook up to the Cinema Display, my windows don't go back to where they were on with the Cinema Display, they stay on the main display in this arrangement. I want them to go back to the way they were.\r\n\r\n** Case 0 **\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I have a laptop connected to a Cinema Display. \r\n2. Laptop display on the left, cinema display on the right. Menu bar on the cinema display.\r\n3. I position my windows the way I want in this configuration. \r\n4. I disconnect the Cinema Display, all my windows are repositioned on the laptop display\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. All windows are repositioned and resized to where they were the last time they where on laptop.\r\n2. For example if Xcode was at Cinema Display width & height, it is resized the max width and height for the current main display. \r\n3. If an app wasn't running when this user session was on the laptop, leave it at it's current size if less than max width & height. If at max width & height, make it the max width & height of new main display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWindows are put on the laptop display, usually left at Cinema Display widths and heights, don't return to previous laptop sizes and positions.\r\n\r\n** Case 1 **\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I have a laptop connected to a Cinema Display. \r\n2. Laptop display on the left, cinema display on the right. Menu bar on the cinema display.\r\n3. I position my windows the way I want in this configuration. \r\n4. I disconnect the Cinema Display, all my windows are repositioned on the laptop display\r\n5. Reconnect the Cinema Display\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll windows are repositioned and resized to where they were the last time the laptop was connected to this cinema display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll windows are left on the main display (one with the menu bar) and at the sizes they were on the laptop display."
