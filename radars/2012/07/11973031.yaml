    description: "26-Jul-2012 08:56 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\nAutomatic Profile Selector for Code Sign setting in Target's Build Settings does not correctly select the provisioning profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI have several provisioning profiles with a * bundle identifier from two different Developer teams (St. Ives Coffee Roasters, and Fish Hook LLC). The St Ives team has my iPhone's UDID in their devices, whereas Fish Hook does not. Therefore, the Fish Hook provisioning profile will not build to my iPhone dev device.\r\n\r\nThe automatic profile selector option in Build Settings chooses to build and run (on my iPhone device) with the Fish Hook LLC provisioning profile for any / all projects, which results in the error `A valid provisioning profile for this executable was not found` (I get this twice in two alert windows back-to-back).\r\n\r\nThis behavior is new in the Xcode 4.4 App Store release, and now causes Xcode 4.5 DP3 to also hiccup\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis can, of course, be fixed by making an actual selection for the correct provisioning profile in the build settings, however this workaround does not scale to a team all checking in changes to the xcodeproj file.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nScreen shots included of:\r\n- Code Sign drop-down selection box\r\n- Organizer's installed Provisioning Profiles\r\n\r\n---CONSOLE LOG---\r\n\r\n7/27/12 8:52:52.433 AM Xcode[10090]: call_and_response (thread 0x106158000): GOT AN ERROR 0xe800003a\r\n7/27/12 8:52:52.433 AM Xcode[10090]: perform_command (thread 0x106158000): There was an error communicating with the service agent: 0xe8008015\r\n7/27/12 8:52:52.433 AM Xcode[10090]: AMDeviceSecureUpgradeApplication (thread 0x106158000): Could not upgrade package on device, error: (null), pathToApplication: PublicStaging/Kumite.app\r\n7/27/12 8:52:52.433 AM Xcode[10090]: Result for ‘/SourceCache/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit-1861/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit_Utilities.m’ at 313 : 0xE8008015\r\n7/27/12 8:52:52.433 AM Xcode[10090]: Result for ‘/SourceCache/IDEiPhoneSupport/IDEiPhoneSupport-1886/Classes/DVTiPhoneMobileDeviceIO.m’ at 284 : 0xE8008015\r\n\r\n---END---\r\n\r\n26-Jul-2012 08:56 PM:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-07-27 at 8.38.01 AM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n26-Jul-2012 08:57 PM:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-07-27 at 8.38.58 AM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n03-Aug-2012 07:37 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
