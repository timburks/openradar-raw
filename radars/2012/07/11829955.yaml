    description: "09-Jul-2012 10:44 AM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary:The iOS Provisioning Portal allows users to perform bulk uploading of device information (UDIDs and device names), but provides no easy way to retrieve that information.\r\n\r\nAs is, the only way to extract the data is to go to the Device page in the Provisioning Portal and manually copy and paste the values from the page into a spreadsheet or other repository.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the Portal provided the ability to export device information in the same format used for bulk upload of that information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
