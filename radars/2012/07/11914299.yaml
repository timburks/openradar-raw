    description: "19-Jul-2012 12:25 PM Jacob DeGrange:\r\nSummary: When an app is purchased or downloaded from the Mac App Store, it becomes hardware serialized to the machine it is installed to. In Enterprise and Educational environments this hinders the management of software and hardware by not allowing these apps to be imaged and distributed through already existing solutions. This is affecting usability, product purchasing and application purchasing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results: When we purchase an app (or group of apps, separate ticket for that) we should be able to create an image of that application and distribute it to users within the Enterprise or Education environment.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
