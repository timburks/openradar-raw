    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a self-signed certificate, trust profiles must be installed. An incorrect insertion into the postgresql db seems to be happening, where the server_organization is being set to the domain of the email address associated with the Apple Push Notification Service on that install.\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetup a 10.8 server installation with normal best practices (manual IP, proper hostname, DNS on the network that resolves forward and reverse lookups for that hostname) and use the server assistant to enter an apple ID for registering the host with the APNS(abanks+demoapril-ioscourse@318.com). Then configure Open Directory with the organization name Pretendco and email instruct@mdm.pretendco.com. Add users, and verify certificates are properly set for ssl using the self-signed local intermediate CA. Start up the Profile Manager service and log in to the mydevices url from a device, going to the Profile tab to install the trust profile.   \r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Trust profile for Pretendco\" is listed\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Trust profile for 318, Inc.\" is listed instead\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not occur in 10.7 server\r\nNotes:\r\nWorked around by manually modifying db, using serveradmin CLI could not correct. Once logging into psql interface, the command was:\r\nUPDATE settings SET server_organization = 'Pretendco' WHERE server_organization = '318, Inc.';\r\n\r\n30-Jul-2012 07:07 PM:\r\n'screenshotsOfAssistantAndResult.zip' was successfully uploaded"
