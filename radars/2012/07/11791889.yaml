    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe documentation for UIStatusBarStyleBlackTranslucent (UIStatusBarStyle value, in UIApplication class reference) calls it \"A transparent black style (specifically, black with an alpha of 0.5).\" However, specifically, it is a black bar with an alpha of 0.6. Additionally, it has a small inner shadow at the bottom that is somewhat darker.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an all white view that uses UIStatusBarStyleBlackTranslucent. Then take a screenshot and sample the color of the status bar. (I have attached such a screenshot)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA 50% black bar would have a gray value of 127 (in tools such as photoshop).\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe color is 102 gray, which is black with 60% alpha.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhile I would prefer that the bar actually had 0.5 alpha, it seems that in the interests of backwards compatibility this is a mistake in the documentation which could be updated to be accurate.\r\n\r\nI know that this is pedantic, but when one is striving to make the most gorgeous, pixel-perfect interfaces possible it is somewhat frustrating to realise, upon implementation, that the mockups are somewhat inaccurate due to mistake in the documentation. This issue is evidence that I am looking over my interfaces with enough rigor to notice an alpha difference of 0.1. Since I don't yet have a blockbuster app on the store, I assume there are other developers and designers with similar high standards to mine.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to say that it would be nice to see documentation on other details related to iOS visuals, such as corner radiuses (why oh why does the app store use something different?). The trial and error required to produce interfaces with the level of quality Apple prefers can be quite frustrating."
