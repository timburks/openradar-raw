    description: "Summary:\r\nXCode 4.5 DP2 (4G108j) routinely gives me the beach ball for 30+ seconds and loads down 100% of the CPU (one core).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen at various places throughout the interface. I've seen this behavior while attempting to click in the console output pane, switching tabs, selecting text in the editor pane, launching an iOS app in the simulator, etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nResponsive and usable interface without being blocked by the beach ball for seemingly trivial actions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe UI is blocked by a spinning beach ball mouse cursor, the app is unresponsive, and CPU utilization is spiked at 100% for 30 seconds or more at a time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI do not see this behavior in Xcode 4.3.3, but have seen it in DP1 as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSorry I can't be more specific or give exact steps to reproduce, but in my configuration it is bordering on unusable.\r\n\r\nUpdate July 10, 2012, 13:16MT\r\nThis only seems to happen when I am debugging an app which is running in the iOS simulator (I have yet to try it with a device)."
