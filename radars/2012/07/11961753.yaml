    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the the primary editor and assistant editor are displaying the same file, pressing escape while editing text in the assistant editor briefly shows the completion popup. Then, after about 0.5s, the completion popup unexpectedly dismisses.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the same exact file in the primary editor & assistant editor.\r\n2. Start editing text in the assistant editor.\r\n3. Press escape to display the completion popup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompletion popup stays shown until I dismiss it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompletion popup dismisses by itself after a very brief delay.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not occur on Xcode 4.3 as far as I can remember.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis ONLY happens if the same file is open in both editors. It ONLY happens in the assistant editor.\r\nI'm on Lion 10.7.4."
