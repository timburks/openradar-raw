    description: "[Duplicate of 11585415 (Closed)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCreating outlets by Ctrl-dragging from a nib/storyboard to .h file generates self.myOutlet = nil in the -viewDidUnload method (and creates the method if it does not exist yet).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an outlet by Ctrl-dragging from a nib/storyboard to .h file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOutlet created and connected, but no -viewDidUnload creation or amendment.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOutlet created and connected, and -viewDidUnload is created or amended.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNilling outlets in -viewDidUnload was already unnecessary with ARC weak references.\r\n[Redacted: why this is even more pertinent in iOS 6.]"
