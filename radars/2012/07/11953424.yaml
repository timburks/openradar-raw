    description: "Summary: While investigating which file versioning doesn't work at all in Quartz Composer Editor I discovered (common enough) process of file saving which crashes what ever Application you perform the following actions in. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch an Application that uses Lion file versioning (or at least claims to given QC Editor blows on file versioning), say TextEdit.app.\r\n\r\n2. Save a file \"test.rft\" to desktop.\r\n\r\n3. File> Duplicate \"test.rft\" –> \"test copy.rft\" is created by TextEdit.app\r\n\r\n4. Save \"test copy.rft\" with filename \"test.rft\"\r\n\r\n5. Answer \"Yes\" to replace existing file. –> N.B. you now have two windows with title of \"test.rft\" \r\n\r\n6. Click on the close button (red dot) of the original \"test.rft\" button. –> You now have 100% risk of an application crash to TextEdit. This is common across many apps I have tested including QC Editor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Final step would close the original \"test.rft\" (so as not to confuse you as to which is the current version)\r\n\r\nActual Results: CRASH\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: QC Editor doesn't do versioning even though it advertises as doing versioning…"
