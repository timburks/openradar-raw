    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen logging a very long string trough NSLog Xcode completely freezes for a few minutes (aka beach balling). The debugged app runs without issues during that time but especially when you are debugging something its pretty annoying to wait a few minutes before Xcode becomes usable again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI attached a example project. Just hit \"Run&Build\". As soon as the app launches try to do something in Xcode and the beach ball will be shown. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo hang. Or at least not a hang which take several minutes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode hangs for more then 2 minutes on my iMac i7\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe way we do the logging is the same for at least 6 month, so far (with Xcode 4.3 and smaller) I never had this issue, but it maybe the API results (which I log in this case) have not hit a certain threshold. I can't test this anymore since I upgraded to Xcode 4.4 and have no 4.3 available anymore.\r\n\r\nI had this issue on Lion 10.7.4 with Xcode 4.4 and 4.5 DP 3. I also had a friend confirm it under Mountain Lion with Xcode 4.4. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI also attached the log which is shown when Xcode is killed during the hang. Everytime I did this Xcode was in the same method \"icu::RegexMatcher::MatchChunkAt(int, signed char, UErrorCode&)\" so maybe there is an issue with the Regex-Parsing in long strings."
