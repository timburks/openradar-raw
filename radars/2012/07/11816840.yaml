    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Developer Preview of Xcode 4.4 from the Mountain Lion Preview had a new feature in the Preferences under Text Editing > Code completion called\" Suggest completion that add import statements\" which doesn't exist in the current DP of Xcode 4.5 (DP2 - iOS 6 preview). That feature was really useful to me, please reintegrate it to Xcode 4.5.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new project and a new class. In one of the template methods type \"MKMapView\". \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode 4.4 add the import of MapKit headers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode 4.5DP2 doesn't.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes. This feature was around in Xcode 4.4DP\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the screenshot from Xcode 4.4DP.\r\n\r\n===\r\nEnclosure: http://cl.ly/HsW3 (Screenshot from Xcode 4.4)"
