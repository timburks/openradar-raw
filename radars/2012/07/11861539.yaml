    description: "Summary: Connecting my Mid-2012 11\" Macbook Air to an external projector using a Mini Displayport to VGA Adaptor results in distorted and unusable video on the projector\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Connect an external projector to the VGA port of a Mini Displayport to VGA Adaptor (http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MB572Z/A). Connect the adaptor to the Thunderbolt port of a Mid-2012 11\" Macbook Air.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The projector appears as a second screen for the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The projector is detected as a second screen, and the Mac's monitor setup changes as if it is supporting two screens, but the projector displays a black screen with a few distorted vertical lines on it.\r\n\r\nRegression: This problem does not occur on an earlier (2011) 11\" Macbook Air. The 2012 MBA was set up as a restore from the 2011 MBA, and so the setup is essentially identical apart from the change in hardware.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have installed the MacBook Air (Mid 2012) Software Update 1.0 (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1551), both via Software Update, and also as a download directly from the kb page, and rebooted the Mac, with no difference in output on the projector.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has been seen with two projectors: one in a conference hall (sadly I don't know the make or model), and on an Hitachi Illumina PJ-TX10."
