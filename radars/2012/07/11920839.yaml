    description: "When adding MKAnnotationViews using -[MKMapView addAnnotations:] sometimes the new pins are not added in the right z order (bottom pins in front). Please see this screenshot: http://d.pr/i/Wqq4\r\n\r\nWhen the map is panned slightly, the z order is corrected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis also happened under iOS 5.x Google based MapKit from time to time but it seems to occur more often under the new Vector MapKit."
