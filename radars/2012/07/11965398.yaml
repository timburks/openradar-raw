    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe unread flag in the mail message list view in Classic layout doesn't always update when the unread status of a message changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways in which this issue can be manifested; I'll describe the most easily reproducible one here.\r\n\r\n1. Set the \"Use classic layout\" preference to on.\r\n\r\n2. Select a message in a mailbox. The message may be either read or unread.\r\n\r\n3. Press Cmd-Shift-U (to toggle its unread status) several times.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEach time Cmd-Shift-U is pressed, the blue circle in the list view (the unread flag) should toggle.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe unread flag does not accurately reflect the unread status of the message. In particular, it tends to get \"stuck on\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis worked correctly on Mail under Lion GM.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOther methods of changing a message's unread status (e.g, viewing a message within a thread) tend to have similar effects. Fixing the underlying issue should presumably fix these as well, though; I've just described the most reproducible way of triggering the bug."
