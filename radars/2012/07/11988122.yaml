    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen 'snoozing' a birthday reminder, a duplicate entry is created in Calendar\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis is tested on my iCloud calendar account\r\n\r\n- Open Calendar\r\n- Open Preferences\r\n- Enable 'Show birthday calendar' on the 'general' tab\r\n- On the Alerts-tab, set Birthdays to \"1 day before (9 AM)\" \r\n\r\nIf a birthday reminder pops up the day before someones birthday:\r\n- Open calendar and re-assure that there's no event scheduled on the current day, only on the persons _actual_ birthday (tomorrow) (see Screenshot1_Before.png)\r\n- Click 'Snooze' (Screenshot2_Snooze.png)\r\n- A new event is created on the *current* day (see Screenshot3_After.png)\r\n\r\nThe new event is created on the *current* day, not on the person's *birthday*\r\nIn the newly created event, the title is 'XYZ's [age minus 1] birthday'\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nTo get rid of the 'ghost' event, disable the Birthday calendar in preferences, wait for all birthdays to disappear and re-enable the Birthday calendar. Be sure to wait a few seconds between disabling/enabling, otherwise a error occurs (Calendar encountered a critical error)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe reminder to just 'snooze' and no new 'ghost' event to be created\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBirthday events are duplicated in Calendar\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'll post another bug report on the disabling/enabling birthday calendar\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlthough this bug has a 'workaround', I still consider this a serious bug"
