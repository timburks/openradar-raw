    description: "Summary:\r\nCan't move windows to secondary display, positioned above the main screen. Windows get \"stuck\" at the menubar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect secondary display. Leave the menubar on the main display (e.g. your laptop). Arrange the secondary display so that it is above the main display (in the display pref pane...doesn't matter where it is physically). Try dragging a window from the main display to the secondary display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWindow moves along with the cursor to the secondary display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor moves to secondary display, window does not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked in previous versions of the OS (Lion, Snow Leopard, and so on)."
