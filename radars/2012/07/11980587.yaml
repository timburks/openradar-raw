    description: "Summary:\r\nAliases created in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion take up huge amounts of space, sometimes even _more_ space than the item they refer to\r\n\r\nOk, maybe I'm old-fashioned. I haven't tested this on OS X Lion, but I just noticed something; Aliasses no longer seem to be just a 'reference' to the original item, but take up quite a bit of space!\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting aliases now store their own copy of their icon, causing their size to be, well, big;\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n- New Folder: zero bytes\r\n- alias to New Folder: 5.8 MB (!)\r\n- System Preferences: 5.2 MB\r\n- alias to System Preferences: 3.5 MB (that's 67% of the original)\r\n- alias to Library: 6,1 MB\r\n- empty text-document: 1 byte\r\n- alias to empty text-document: 1.2 MB (!)\r\n\r\nSome examples are shown in the screenshot attached\r\n\r\nI always expected an alias to be a lightweight solution; I never expected an alias to actually take up more space than it's original\r\nIs this 'by design'? To improve performance? (no longer required to look up the original icon)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an alias of any item and inspect the alias to determine it's filesize\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAliases to take up 'no' space, just be a reference to the original item\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAliases take up a lot of space, sometimes even _more_ than the original item\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
