    description: "Summary:\r\nScrolling a source file in the Version Editor in Xcode is noticeably slower than when scrolling in the standard editor. Actually, scrolling in the standard editor is also slow, when compared to scrolling in, say, Safari\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a 3000 line source file in Xcode. Maximize the window, and scroll. Notice uncomfortable lag.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen running Xcode on the fastest Retina MBP Apple has to offer, I expect scrolling to be snappy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScrolling is sluggish.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTextEdit scrolls faster.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
