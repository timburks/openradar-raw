    description: "30-Jul-2012 12:17 PM Adam McNamara:\r\nSummary:\r\nWe have a UITableViewCell subclass that had a block called \"action\" as an ivar.  In prepareForReuse, we'd set action = nil;.\r\n\r\nARC wasn't copying the block when assigning to the ivar, so we'd crash in prepareForReuse. It would only appear in an Ad Hoc build on device. It was not present during debug builds or in the simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITableView subclass with a block as an ivar.\r\n2. Set ivar = block.\r\n3. In prepareForReuse, set the block = nil.\r\n4. Install as an ad hoc build on device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ivar should be nil'd out properly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application crashes with Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0xc5f6c046 in prepareForReuse.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. This only happened on an Ad Hoc build.\r\n2. Turning the block into a @property (nonatomic, copy) BlockType action; and using self.action = nil worked."
