    description: "Summary: When opening \"Customize Toolbar...\" dialog many buttons and even address bar can be removed.  Reader button is not needed when user doesn't use Reader functionality but unfortunately this button can't be removed at all even through \"Customize Toolbar...\" dialog.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open \"Customize Toolbar...\" dialog.  Try to drag Reader button away.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Reader button removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Reader button is attached to address bar.\r\n\r\nRegression: Reader button was absent in earlier versions of Safari so this is definitely a regression."
