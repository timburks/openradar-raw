    description: "26-Jul-2012 03:30 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe reticle or pointer that is displayed when attempting to capture a screenshot using OS X's built in screen grabbing functionality flickers and jumps sporadically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn your keyboard press: <command><shift><4>.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the pointer to be displayed smoothly just as the mouse pointer does normally, and just as it was displayed in older version of Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe pointer flickers and jumps in fashion that is jarring and indicative of some problem.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem is new in the latest released version of Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. This issue was not present in any previous version of OS X going back to Tiger.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not a problem with the mouse. This feature worked flawlessly in the latest version of OS X 10.7 and only started occurring after the upgrade to 10.8.\r\n\r\n26-Jul-2012 03:30 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'iMac.spx' was successfully uploaded"
