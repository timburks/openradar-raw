    description: "I recently had to debug a text sizing issue involving -[NSString sizeWithFont:]. I wondered why I had different results in code and the debugger. It boiled down to this line in the debugger (LLDB or GDB doesn't matter):\r\n\r\n(gdb) p (CGFloat) [[UIFont systemFontOfSize:12.0f] pointSize]\r\n$3 = 0\r\n\r\n(gdb) po [UIFont systemFontOfSize:12.0f]\r\n<UICFFont: 0x8e4b720> font-family: \".Helvetica NeueUI\"; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 0px\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the UIFont object allocated in the debugger has the right fontName and other attributes but always a font size of 0.\r\n\r\nThis was reproducible:\r\n\r\n- in Xcode 4.3.3 on 10.7\r\n- in Xcode 4.5 DP 3 on 10.7\r\n- in Xcode 4.4 DP 7 on 10.8 beta\r\n- in the Simulator (running iOS 5.1 and 6.0 beta 3)\r\n- on iPhone 4S (running iOS 6.0 beta 3)"
