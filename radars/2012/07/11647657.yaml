    description: "12-Jun-2012 11:39 AM Todd Thomas:\r\nSummary:\r\nEvery single time my app goes to use CLLocation I get an alert panel asking to allow or not. My app never ends up in the list of apps in System Preferences -> Privacy and Security -> Privacy -> Location Services\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run an app that uses Core Location\r\n2. Click allow when the alert panel asking for permission comes up.\r\n3. Repeat 1.\r\n4. You'll always get to 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce the app has asked for permission and it has been allowed I assume you shouldn't see the allow/disallow alert panel any more. I also assume if you wanted to disallow my app from using location services later you'd need to go System Preferences and disable it - but right now my app doesn't even show up in the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested on DP4 on one of my machines with my app built against 10.8 SDK.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n05-Jul-2012 09:00 PM Todd Thomas:\r\nFirst the system.log.. test app will be attached next..\r\n\r\n05-Jul-2012 09:00 PM Todd Thomas:\r\n'system.log.gz' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n05-Jul-2012 09:06 PM Todd Thomas:\r\nThe test app. Run app. Will ask to use your location. Will fetch and return location (printed in console). Quit app. Restart app. Will ask again. Repeat until sanity seems to be slipping away.. ;-)\r\n\r\nThis app was tested on my macbook pro running 12A256 as well as on another developer's machine as well. Same result. \r\n\r\nThe real app where we are seeing this behaviour is Tweetbot for Mac. All 3 of us have this issue when using the app on 10.8. I'm pretty sure this wasn't an issue on DP 2 or 3..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n05-Jul-2012 09:06 PM Todd Thomas:\r\n'TestLocation.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n09-Jul-2012 08:34 PM Todd Thomas:\r\nThis is still an issue on GM seed Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nThe TestLocation app shows up in my list of authorized apps in system preferences yet when I run the app authorization status always returns undetermined and I get a 'TestLocation wants to use your location' allow? alert every time the app runs.\r\n\r\nThis also happens with Tweetbot for Mac. I just built a new version on 10.8 GM and it asks the user's permission every single time too. It also doesn't show up in the list of apps in Location Services..."
