    description: "ummary:\r\nWhen a file moves from where iTunes expects to locate it, it does not sync the file and issues a warning dialog.\r\nThe warning dialog has a disclosure triangle that shows all entries.\r\n\r\nThese entries however are not copyable from the dialog. Further no more than one entry at a time is selectable from the dialog.\r\n\r\nIt would be greatly helpful if this list could be fully selected, copied, or exported to more easily handle correcting the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMove a directory of files in iTunes Library (Can be done by moving the library as a whole)\r\nSync to iDevice\r\nWarning dialog appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nList can be selected as a whole and copied or exported\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIndividual only items can be selected but not copied.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nEnhancement\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf this info dumps to a log somewhere, the location alone would help me.\r\nAdditionally posted issue to Stack Exchange:\r\nhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/56827/getting-the-whole-itunes-not-found-list"
