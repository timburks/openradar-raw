    description: "29-Jul-2012 02:47 PM aaron Smith:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nARD on 5GHz network doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGet two machines on a 5GHz wireless network and try to connect to one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nConnect to the other machine quickly with no issues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nConnection often fails or is so slow it barely works.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSwitch to a 2.4 GHz network and it works fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI originally reported issue 11477158 as well, wich it turns out is also because of the 5GHz network. The router I'm using is a Cisco Linksys E2500.\r\n\r\nhttp://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1729402"
