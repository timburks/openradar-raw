    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf I delete a message in an IMAP folder and later receive a new message in the same thread, the deleted message reappears in the folder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Connect to an IMAP server (I'm using Pobox Mailstore, which uses Cyrus IMAP)\r\n* Make sure that \"View -> Organize by Conversation\" is checked.\r\n* Send yourself a test message and wait for it to appear in the Inbox\r\n* Delete it from the Inbox.\r\n* Go into sent messages, select the message, and send it again.\r\n* Wait for the new message to appear in the Inbox\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe second message, when it arrives, should be the only test message in the Inbox.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBoth the new copy of the message and the old copy will appear in the view of the message thread.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis behavior did not exist in Mail on Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm gonna guess that the threading code somehow does not know to ignore purged messages."
