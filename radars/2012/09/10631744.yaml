    description: "29-Dec-2011 11:23 PM Iain Dawson:\r\nSummary:\r\nOn the boundaries of overscroll, scroll momentum does not behave as the overscroll metaphor would otherwise imply.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. With two fingers on a trackpad, scroll past the edge of a content area\r\n2. Fling the content back in the opposite direction, removing fingers before the content is out of the overscroll area.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe content continues at the speed it is flung at, reducing in speed until it stops.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs soon as it hits the border on the edge of overscroll, the content drastically increases its speed, in some cases flying pages and pages beyond its edge.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis may be intentional (or simply settled for), but I feel overscroll should behave like damped springs around the edges of the content that hook onto the edges of whatever area the content fills. If such springs were properly dampened, no such acceleration would occur. In fact, no matter how poorly dampened they were, acceleration would not occur at all in the manner that it does in Lion."
