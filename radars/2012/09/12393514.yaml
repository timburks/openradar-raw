    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery day, without warning or obvious reason, my computer kernel panics, and the resulting panic report always has dvtexec as \"current process\". Quite often the kernel panic has happened while the computer was asleep (!?!? talk about power nap) so that it's just powered down when I need it in the morning. Sometimes it will kernel panic in the middle of me doing work, however.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode for more than a day\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. You can keep working\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. Your work is lost\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nMy bug reports weren't quite as snarky before the \"description format\" was auto-inserted.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n28-Sep-2012 11:27 AM Joachim Bengtsson:\r\n'MacBook Air.spx' was successfully uploaded"
