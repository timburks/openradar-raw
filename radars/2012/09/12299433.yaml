    description: "Clang supports the -ffast-math flag from gcc, and as per gcc will define __FAST_MATH__ when it is set. Unlike gcc, a subsequent -fno-fast-math does not undefine the __FAST_MATH__ macro.\r\n\r\nMost of our config options are set in .xcconfig files, where we turn on fast math by default. For some source files we need to lower this, so provide a per-file compiler flag to turn it off.\r\n\r\nThis produces a command line which contains both flags (first turning it on, then turning it off): under gcc the code can test for the current mode using __FAST_MATH__, under clang it always appears to be on.\r\n\r\nSeen in Xcode 4.4.1, clang version 4.0:\r\n\r\n  Apple clang version 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-421.0.60) (based on LLVM 3.1svn)\r\n  Target: x86_64-apple-darwin12.1.0\r\n  Thread model: posix"
