    description: "Summary:\r\nSome requests don't get through if we have a pending HTTP long polling request on the same hostname.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing NSURLConnection :\r\n- Create a HTTP long polling request on a hostname and never terminate this request.\r\n- Send other requests (not long polling one) on the same hostname.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The other requests should get through\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Some of the other request are not sent. They seem to be blocked into a queue. The server doesn't receive any request. The request get a timeout after a while.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- For now, we avoid this bug by using a different hostname on the long polling request than on the other requests.\r\n- Another bug that can be caused. Sometimes, opening a long polling request on a hostname doesn't work at all, probably because the old long polling request is still in the queue. To fix it, we need to use random hostnames for long polling requestsâ€¦\r\n- More information on this thread : http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/x0fiWJS4tDbMzCjn5GsJ"
