    description: "Summary:\r\nMy mid-2007 MacBook Pro (3,1) will wake from sleep every minute or so, despite the lid being shut, the \"Wake for Ethernet network access\" option being unchecked, Bluetooth turned off, and NO USB peripherals plugged in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet your hands on a trusty old MacBook Pro(3,1) from mid-2007 and get up to speed with Mac OS X 10.8. Plug in the AC adapter. Configure a connection to a local Wifi connection.\r\n\r\nIn System Preferences do the following:\r\n(1) Turn off Bluetooth\r\n(2) Use the following Energy Saver settings for the power adapter\r\n\r\nComputer sleep: never\r\nDisplay sleep: 3 minutes\r\nCheck \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\"\r\nUncheck \"Wake for Ethernet network access\"\r\nUncheck \"Start up automatically after a power failure\"\r\n\r\nNow, close the lid to the computer. It should go to sleep normally once the memory has been dumped to the disk. Let the computer remain like this for awhile.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that when the lid of the laptop is closed that the computer will go to sleep and remain asleep until I open the lid again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEver minute or so the computer will wake up. It is very easy to tell when this happens because the superdrive does it's typical mechanical rotation upon wakeup.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI can say with absolute certainty that this was not a problem on any previous version of OS X. This is a new issue that started with the installation of OS X 10.8 on this machine. Previous versions of OS X back to 10.4 (Tiger) did not exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached, please find the system profile for this laptop. I have also included the wake log as reported by sysctl with the following command: \"syslog | grep -i \"Wake reason\" > wake_log.txt\"\r\n\r\nAs the log shows, it appears that the reason the computer is waking up is because of \"EHC2\" which if I had to guess is one of the network adapters. However, Bluetooth is turned off [according to system preferences] and the Wifi connection should not be triggering a wake up because the \"Wake for Ethernet network access\" box in not checked in Energy Preferences."
