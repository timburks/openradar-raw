    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n<ServiceManagement/ServiceManagement.h>\r\n\r\nSMJobBless() can be used to add privileged helper tools (daemons) to the system by handling privilege escalation and installing for you. SMJobRemove() is the only tear down function provided and it seems to only stop the daemon, not actually clean up any files (/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.something.plist and /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.something\r\n\r\nThis is ok because you'll need to remove the old before re adding a job/daemon/etc. but not suffecient for a complete removal and would require additional tools/uninstallers/etc to properly clean up any app residue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the API and try and add a system daemon and remove it permanently.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAPI is more complete. Can not only properly add/start/stop/remove but also query damon status(not just running but installed, etc)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAPI in it's current state is half baked.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/732683#732683"
