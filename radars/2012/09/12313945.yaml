    description: "Summary: The \"iTunes Links\" suggested here do not work correctly: https://developer.apple.com/appstore/mac/resources/marketing/index.html For example, http://itunes.com/mac/junecloudllc just opens iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the link http://itunes.com/mac/junecloudllc or http://itunes.com/mac/notefile in a browser\r\n\r\nExpected Results: On a Mac with the Mac App Store, this link should open the Mac App Store and display all apps by Junecloud LLC, or the app Notefile for the second link. On iOS, or a computer without the Mac App Store, I would expect some sort of helpful message explaining that a Mac with the Mac App Store is required.\r\n\r\nActual Results: iTunes opens. The iTunes Store displays with no error. On iOS 6, iTunes opens and displays an \"item not found\" error.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes: It is possible to open the correct page on the Mac App Store by using macappstore:// instead of http:// but this results in an ugly error on iOS or Windows. Not a good solution. The http:// links should work similar to itms:// links, where it attempts to open the app and then shows a clear error page if it can't."
