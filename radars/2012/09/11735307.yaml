    description: "24-Jun-2012 12:00 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nThree finger gestures to navigate forward or back often do not register in Safari, Finder, and other applications, both on built-in trackpad and Magic Trackpad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse three-finger navigational swipes in application, such as Safari.  Three-finger swipe produces no results.  Using horizontal two-finger swipe, followed immediately after by a three-finger swipe produces the desired results.\r\nAccount is an Admin user; the only account on the device, with a local home directory.  No accessibility options have been enabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nForward or backward navigation in Safari or Finder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNavigation forward or back does not occur.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nFunctional in current builds of 10.7.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
