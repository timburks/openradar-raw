    description: "24-Sep-2012 07:40 PM Cameron Skinner:\r\nSummary: With XCode 4.5, deploying to iOS 5.1 ( using 5.1 simulator ), the saveToUrl method on UIDocument fails to call the completion handler block passed into that method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n1. Open the project included with this bug report. \r\n2. Set the simulator to iOS 5.1.\r\n3. Run\r\n4. Enter text into text field\r\n5. Click the \"save\" button\r\n\r\nNotice that the save button remains in a selected state, app appears hung.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould have seen the \"Got the blocke\" and \"Done\" message in the console output. If you switch to the iOS 6.0 simulator, that is indeed what happens ( i.e., everything is working when deploying and using the iOS 6.0 simulator ).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApp appears hung, as the completion handler is never invoked.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis used to work before upgrading either to Lion 10.8.2, iTunes 10, or XCode 4.5. It was working with Xcode 4.5GM.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n24-Sep-2012 07:40 PM Cameron Skinner:\r\n'SaveToUrlProblem.zip' was successfully uploaded"
