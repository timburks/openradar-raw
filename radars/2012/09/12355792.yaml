    description: "Summary: Text selection doesn't scroll the view correctly in iOS 6 in apps like Apple's Notes app. For example if you're trying to select a large block of text that doesn't all fit on the screen at once.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app like the built-in Notes (or my own Notefile which uses a UITextView) where you basically have a large text area and a keyboard, without much else.\r\n2. Enter a large amount of text in the text view, enough that it doesn't fit on the screen at once.\r\n3. Tap in the text to bring up the keyboard and show the cursor.\r\n4. Select some text—just a word or a few words.\r\n5. Drag the end of the selection as you would if you wanted to select many lines or paragraphs. Your finger should move down to the very bottom of the view, or even into the keyboard area.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: In iOS 5, the view would scroll to always show the end of the selection. This is the behavior I'd expect, because I want to see what I'm selecting. The magnification popup should also show the text at the end of my selections.\r\n\r\nActual Results: In iOS 6, the view doesn't scroll at all. The magnified area moves around with my finger, but it goes blank. In order to get an accurate selection I have to manually scroll, drag the selection handle again, and repeat if necessary.\r\n\r\nRegression: This issue is not present in 5.1.1.\r\n\r\nNotes: I've found that if I get my finger in just the right spot it will scroll properly—like at the very bottom of the text view. If I'm not in just the right spot, it scrolls extremely slowly, and if I move my finger down into the keyboard area—which is what I'd normally do to select a large block of text—it just stops scrolling entirely."
