    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen changing the setting to reverse scroll direction for trackpad or mouse the other device's setting is affected as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- check the trackpad scroll direction \"natural\" setting\r\n- uncheck the mouse scroll direction\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- the mouse setting should be separate from the trackpad setting\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- unchecking the mouse scroll direction checkbox also unchecks the setting for trackpad\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is a nuisance for people who are switching between a notebook internal trackpad and an external USB mouse with trackwheel."
