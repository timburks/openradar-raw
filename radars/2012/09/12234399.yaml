    description: "Summary:\r\nCompared to the User Scripts menu in Xcode 3, Xcode 4 lacks anything beyond rudimentary scripting support. \r\n\r\nAppleScripting is still completely hosed, the Behaviours feature only allows for running scripts without any sort of context like \"current selection\" and other useful variables. \r\n\r\nThis means that currently one has to script Xcode in 2 places depending on whether one wants to operate on the selected text (Automator+Run Shell Script phase with replace selected text enabled) or on all the files. \r\nAs far as I can see, there is no easy way to operate on just a subset of files belonging to the currently active project. Pardon my opinion but this seems absurd for a professional tool like Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any project\r\n2. Try to automate tasks suitable for scripting that operate on different levels of input: selected text, active file, all files of certain type etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should make this easy and ideally make it accessible from one spot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode currently doesn't do it at all or makes it harder than it needs to be.\r\nAlso it splits functionality across different programs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorking fine in Xcode 3. Currently missing in action:\r\n\r\n• Environment variables:\r\n  %%%{PBXSelectionStart}%%%\r\n  %%%{PBXSelectionEnd}%%%\r\n  %%%{PBXFilePath}%%%\r\n  %%%{PBXAllText}%%%\r\n  %%%{PBXTextLength}%%%\r\n\r\n• Options for Script Input\r\n  Selection\r\n  Entire Document\r\n\r\n• Options for Script Output:\r\n  Replace Selection\r\n  Replace Document Contents\r\n  Display in Alert\r\n  Insert after Selection\r\n  Insert after Document Contents\r\n  Place on Clipboard\r\n  Open in New Document\r\n  Open as HTML\r\n\r\n• Options for Error Output:\r\n  Display in Alert\r\n  Place on Clipboard\r\n  Merge with script output\r\n\r\n• The built-in script editor and organizer\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI found the list posted in Regression in a Cocoabuilder post. \r\nIt mentions that the built-in script editor should be brought back.\r\nIn my opinion I think it would suffice if the options present for a script in the script editor be put together with the behaviour's Run Script: drop down, maybe right below it so that they can become active once a script has been selected.\r\nWe can write the scripts themselves with another editor (like TextMate, BBEdit, etc.)."
