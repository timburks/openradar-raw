    description: "15-Nov-2011 11:08 AM Richard Green:\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently, if the \"Speak Selection\" function is used within an app whilst music is playing then the volume of the music is reduced whilst the text to speech is reading the text, however, it may be difficult to concentrate and/or hear the speech due to the distraction of the music. I therefore suggest the addition of a systemwide toggle option within the Accessibility preferences to provide the user with the option of either pausing the music or reducing the music volume whilst text is being read.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
