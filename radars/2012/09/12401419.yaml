    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Xcode release notes mention that \"During a code completion interaction, Xcode gives higher priority to completions you have used recently.\"\r\n\r\nI find that Xcode always prefers CGRectMakeWithDictionaryRepresentation over CGRectMake. I swear that I never used CGRectMakeWithDictionaryRepresentation but this is what I always see when I type \"CGRectMak\": \r\n\r\nhttp://i.agilebits.com/rk/2012-09-29_12-06-22.png\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nStart typing \"CGRectM\" and manually select CGRectMake from the list. Xcode will always offer to autocomplete the longer function."
