    description: "19-Sep-2012 04:17 PM Julien Delarbre:\r\nSummary:\r\nMPMoviePlayerController behavior has changed when entering full screen playback. \r\nIn iOS 6 when activating fullscreen mode the MPMoviePlayerController in the view controller that contains the Movie Player View calls the methods viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear. In iOS5, those methods were not called. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the MoviePlayer sample project\r\n2. In MoviePlayerAppDelegate, replace the following line\r\nwindow addSubview:tabBarController.view;\r\n  with this one \r\nwindow.rootViewController = tabBarController;\r\n4. build the application and change the Movie playback control style to Embedded (in the application settings)\r\n5. Lauch the local video and set it to fullscreen mode.\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe methods viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear should not be called\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe methods viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear are called\r\nRegression:\r\nThe MoviePlayer sample code doesn't work correctly anymore because in the method viewWillDisappear, the movie player is removed."
