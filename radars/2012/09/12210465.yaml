    description: "30-Aug-2012 02:58 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nTitle pretty much says it all; see attached screenshot.

When the app is set to open in low resolution, the issue is not present.\r\n\r\n\r\n30-Aug-2012 02:58 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-08-30 at 14.52.45.png' was successfully uploaded"
