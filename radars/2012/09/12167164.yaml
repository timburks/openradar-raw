    description: Since updating to 10.8, the Wifi icon on the right side of the menue bar is showing an exclamation mark notifying me that there is no working internet connection. However, the connection is working properly. When clicking on the warning within the context menue, network diagnosis pops up and ultimately determines that my connection is in fact working. Yet, the exclamation mark remains superimposed on the network icon.
