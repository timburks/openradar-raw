    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHTTP Basic Authentication (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) credentials never get stored in the Keychain. The user has to re-enter the same credentials every time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Try to access any URL that uses Basic Auth\r\n2. Enter credentials and tap \"Log In\"\r\n3. Access the same URL again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter step 2 a dialog asking the user if the credentials should be stored should be displayed. And after Step 3 the credentials should be already filled in. Basically the same behaviour as with HTML login forms, would be expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe credentials are not stored and have to be re-entered every time.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is especially annoying when installing an in-house application where several requests occur (plist, ipa, icons) and the credentials have to be re-entered several times."
