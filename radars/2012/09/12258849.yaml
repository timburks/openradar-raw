    description: "07-Sep-2012 04:53 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI am trying to rotate an NSTextField with setFrameCenterRotation. The blue focus ring does not rotate with the view when I rotate it. The focus ring remains where it was which makes it look like a terrible rendering glitch/bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a demo project with a TextField, TextView and Button.\r\n\r\nType some text in the TextField and leave the focus on the TextField. Click the button to rotate everything 90 degrees. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEverything should rotate 90 degrees and look perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe blue focus ring fails to rotate but everything else does.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think this was broken as far back as 10.5. I'm pretty sure I filed a bug on this circa 2007 but I can't find it. (A bunch of my bugs disappeared.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWe are trying to do interesting things with Core Animation on both iOS and Mac. The following video demonstrates putting UIWebViews and AVPlayerLayers in host views and tying them to Box2D physics models. The views collide and bounce and rotate according to physics while they are doing stuff. This technique can be extended to any view as long as Core Animation works correctly. \r\n\r\nhttp://yfrog.com/j0d66z\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are trying to get the Mac side to catch up with the iOS side for our product. The iOS side works much better. We keep hitting a lot of bugs and limitations on the Mac side. In this case, it is very cool that text entry and rendering do work correctly in this case and only the focus ring is broken.\r\n\r\nTextView was a little non-obvious to me that I had to rotate the encompassing scrollview, but it kind of makes sense in hindsight. It's nice that that one works.\r\n\r\nMac layer-backed WebView is my nemesis and I have many bugs on that one going back to 2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10-Sep-2012 12:08 PM Eric Wing:\r\nThis is a minor thing, but I forgot to enable layer backing on the textfield,view,button. The layerbacking is enabled on the contentView and my understanding is that these things are supposed to automatically enabled if the parent view is enabled, though to me it looks like this wasn't actually the case. TextView actually seems to  have rendering problems once layer backing is enabled. I will file a different bug on this one. TextField seems to behave mostly the same, though I noticed one glitch where the white background didn't rotate in one case, but I was unable to reproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\nRotateTextView uploaded at https://github.com/ewmailing/MyAppleBugs"
