    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Cancel / Proceed (actual label varies) buttons in the AuthAgent dialog asking the user for admin authorization are misaligned when running OS X 10.8.2 in the German localization.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System Preferences\r\n2. Open Security preferences\r\n3. Click on unlock (lock first if it is not locked).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nButtons are right aligned to optical border of dialog, as defined by rightmost border of dialog text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nButtons jut out to the right, giving the dialog a broad right margin. [see screenshot: http://cl.ly/JcdS]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIssue detracts from visual balance – functionality proper is not impaired (aka “Google wouldn’t give a sh*t” – but this is Apple, right?)"
