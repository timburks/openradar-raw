    description: "21-Jul-2012 08:29 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nWhen moving a Safari window between a 1x and 2x display, the window updates its scale factor correctly. However, previous content doesn't update. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Open a page in a window on a Retina display.\r\n2. Follow a link.\r\n3. Move window to 1x display; window chrome and content switch scale factors.\r\n4. Click \"back\"; displayed content is 2x on the 1x display.\r\n\r\nThe scale factor can be reset by dragging it between displays and back. Screen recording is attached showing the above steps, plus a couple more.\r\n\r\n21-Jul-2012 08:29 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\n'Safari and Retina.mov' was successfully uploaded"
