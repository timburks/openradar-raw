    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ctrl+scroll screen zoom feature breaks semi-permanently after invoking Time Machine on a multi-monitor setup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a Mac powering several monitors (in this case it's a 15\" MacBook Pro and a 1080p television on the other end of an HDMI cable plugged into a Mini DisplayPort > HDMI adapter) with the ctrl+scroll screen-zoom feature enabled.\r\n2. Hold down ctrl and scroll to ensure that screen zoom is working\r\n3. Invoke Time Machine\r\n4. Back out of Time Machine\r\n5. Hold down ctrl and scroll\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreen zoom.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing. Until you uncheck and recheck the box that deals with that particular feature deep in the Universal Access prefpane, no screen zooming is possible.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDoesn't appear to happen when the displays are mirrored."
