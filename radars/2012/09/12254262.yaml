    description: "The documentation for NSDataReadingMappedIfSafe says:\r\n\r\n\"A hint indicating the file should be mapped into virtual memory, if possible and safe.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not define what \"safe\" means.\r\n\r\nQuinn says that \"'safe' means 'if the volume containing this file goes away, the system is toast.'  On iOS this translates to 'true'.  On Mac OS X it effectively means 'is on the root volume'.\"\r\n\r\nPlease add this (or an equivalent) definition to the documentation and header file for NSData. Developers shouldn't have to guess as to the meaning of vague words in documentation."
