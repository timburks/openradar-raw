    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently OS X offers the ability to create a service to manipulate selected text, or separately to insert new text. However it is impossible to create a single service that can handle both cases.\r\n\r\nThis would be very useful for some situationsâ€”such as a service that creates markup that could insert a fully formatted HTML tag with the selected text enclosed, or insert a tag with no text in the case of no selection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a service as detailed in the Services Implementation Guide with NSStringPboardType specified in the NSReturnTypes.\r\n2. Add a NSSendTypes key specifying an NSStringPboardType.\r\n3. Open a text document and note that the service is not available when no text selection is made.\r\n4. Remove the NSSendTypes key.\r\n5. Open a text document and note that the service is available when no text selection is made, but it overwrites any selected text if activated when a selection is active.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe service should be available both when text is selected and when no selection is made. The behaviour could be optionally enabled through an Info.plist key, as with most other Services settings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA single service can only be made available when text is selected OR when there is no selection. If a selection is active when a service that does not register for pasteboard input is activated, it will be overwritten.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
