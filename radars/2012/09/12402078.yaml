    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nControls hooked up to user-defined actions on the First Responder proxy object fail to message the responder chain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Create a new Utility app\r\n- Add a doSomething:(id)sender to the app delegate, add a breakpoint there\r\n- in the storyboard for FlipsideViewController define doSomething: under user-defined actions\r\n- replace the link of the Done button with one to the First Responder proxy object and choose the doSomething action\r\n- Build&Run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- the action should travel the responder chain and end up at the breakpoint in the app delegate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- no action is invoked\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- the behavior is broken in Storyboards. It works when not using story boards.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOn a non-storyboard app the sendAction of UIApplication has the next upper view controller as target. When using a storyboard the sendAction instead messages the UIBarButtonItem first. I suspect that because UIBarButtonItem is not a UIResponder subclass the default behavior is for the event bubbling to stop there.\r\n\r\nIf you add a new button to the FlipsideController and also hook this hop to the doSomething: action it doesn't even call the application's sendAction. On a non-storyboard app this would also normally send the action to the closest view controller."
