    description: "Summary: When downloading or purchasing a new app from the App Store, I get prompted for my Apple ID password, and when the keyboard appears sometimes it appears to have staticy glitchy lines that span across the top of it. This seems to persist only while that keyboard is visible. This also only happens sporadically. Maybe 1 out of every 3-5 times that I've had to enter my password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the App Store\r\n2. Find an app that you have not downloaded or purchased before\r\n3. Tap to install/buy\r\n4. Virtual keyboard appears as you are prompted for the password for your Apple ID\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Launch the App Store\r\n2. Find an app that you have not downloaded or purchased before\r\n3. Tap to install/buy\r\n4. You are prompted for the password for your Apple ID\r\n5. Virtual keyboard appears as normal (though rainbows and ponies would be acceptable)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Launch the App Store\r\n2. Find an app that you have not downloaded or purchased before\r\n3. Tap to install/buy\r\n4. You are prompted for the password for your Apple ID\r\n5. Virtual keyboard appears with glitchy lines at the top\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: Have only experienced this on an iPhone 5, but haven't done much testing on a 3.5\" screen."
