    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a group iMessage is created it often creates multiple threads. For example, when creating a new thread with two people, their responses end up in two separate message threads.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new group message with two people whose contact cards both contain phone numbers and email addresses. When they respond, a new thread is created.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessages within that thread should stay their and their responses in that thread should all go to the same place.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessages from each person go to their own thread, but the message is sent to all parties. One thread will say it is a group thread, but only one person's responses will show their, and the other person's responses will go in a similar thread.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll messages used to go to the same thread. It seems that including the phone number in Messages for Mac could be the problem. Multiple threads are not created on Mac.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
