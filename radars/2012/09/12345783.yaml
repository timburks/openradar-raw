Can't figure out exact steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe section headers should not look like folders.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe section headers looks like folders.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug has been in the system since the first version of Mountain Lion I think. And is still with us in 10.8.2."
