        I love "Treat warnings as errors". It makes me write better code, so I try to have it on in most projects. However, sometimes I want to disable it temporarily, while I rapidly try out some features. If I just go and turn it off, there's a danger I'll forget to turn it back on. Enter "Hacking Mode".

        I'd like a menu option, "Enable Hacking Mode", that temporarily suppresses Treat Warnings as Errors. It should do this in a way that does not get persisted to disk (i.e. only for the duration of the session), and it should show a very obvious visual feedback to remind you (such as turning the whole Xcode title bar dark grey, a bit like private browsing on iOS).
