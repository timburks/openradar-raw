    description: "07-Sep-2012 04:29 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nI want to rotate NSView's with animation using the animator.\r\n\r\nOne example is imagine rotating a magnetic compass around so the North pointer spins around\r\nto the bottom. Another example is simulating the iPhone image on screen and rotating the image as if they turned the phone landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis can kind of be achieved with NSView's setFrameCenterRotation: and the animator. However, the animation looks really bad and is kind of unusable.\r\n\r\nInstead of spinning around the center, it seems to simultaneously translate the image and rotate which creates a wobbly (seasick) animation while its rotating. Behind the scenes, I think the anchorPoint is in the bottom-left corner and it is being translated to the center. Then the animation rotates and then shifts back the anchorPoint. \r\n\r\nBut whatever it is, it looks terrible, makes me seasick, and makes it hard to know how large the encompassing window/view needs to be to show the entire object spin around since it translates off its center point.\r\n\r\nThis really should be fixed. Apple is notorious for perfecting all the little details. This is one of those details that needs to be perfected because it is obvious to anybody that it doesn't look right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a simple project with a button that rotates 90 degrees when you click it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nButton should rotate perfectly around its center.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nButton rotates and translates in a wobbly way.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think this goes back to 10.5. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'RotateViewOld' uploaded at https://github.com/ewmailing/MyAppleBugs"
