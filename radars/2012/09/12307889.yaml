    description: "16-Sep-2012 11:38 AM Riccardo Boninsegna:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt is impossible to load a S/MIME identity which wasn't password protected at export time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-Generate a .p12 archive containing a certificate+public key and a private key.\r\n(in Keychain Access, select both of those items at once, then select Export 2 Items from the contextual menu and don't enter a password in the first, double password entry dialog box)\r\n-Email the generated file to yourself, and open it on your iOS device.\r\n-The Preferences app opens the file in the profile manager as expected.\r\n-Tap the Install button, and do so again in the confirmation alert box.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe profile gets installed without further prompts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA password screen (with the appearance of the one used to change an alphanumeric passcode) appears, prompting to 'Enter the password for the certificate \"Identity Certificate\"'.\r\n-It is impossible to progress as any password is correctly identified as wrong, but the Next button at the top right remains disabled if the password entry field is left empty. The Return button on the on-screen keyboard doesn't operate.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProblem verified on both production (5.1.1) and beta (6.0b4) iOS versions."
