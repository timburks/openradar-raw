    description: "Summary:\r\niOS Maps.app doesn't allow swiping between directions when using current location.\r\n\r\nWhen seeking driving directions that start at \"current location\" the swipe between steps is disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap directions button.\r\n2. Choose car/driving directions\r\n3. Start at current location.\r\n4. End at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino...\r\n5. Choose route number and tap start.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCurrent behavior + swipe between directions possible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to swipe between directions (even though in most other cases it is possible)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn iOS 5 maps this was achievable.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPossibly this is not linked to using \"current location\" but to \"voice navigation instructions\". If that is the case I'd argue it is still useful to enter directions this way and have swiping enabled. For example: I memorize instructions by reading and looking at map features prior to starting a motorcycle trip (with no access to phone). I'd like to enter my request as efficiently as possible (using current location instead of dropping pin or putting address etc) and still be able to view all steps."
