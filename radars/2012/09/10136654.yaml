    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile Xcode's autocompletion is great, it overdoes it. Very often it suggests a completion at the end of a valid word, most notoriously when entering \"nil\", after having typed the \"l\" it suggests \"Nil\" and \"nil\" and with that prevents the arrow keys from working as it waits for confirmation. See the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open some Obj-C code\r\n- Type \"nil\" and see how it suggests \"Nil\" and \"nil\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's just one level too much autocompletion, Xcode should not propose completions after perfectly valid keywords. The example above is a non-issue while writing code as the suggestion disappears when hitting space, but it's annoying when navigating through existing code and replacing certain parts of the code.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering!"
