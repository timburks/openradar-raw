    description: "For 'generic' carriers, i.e. those that don't sell iPhones, APN settings aren't available in Settings app.\r\n\r\nUpgraded from Beta 6, where this worked fine. Settings app used to show \"Carrier: 10.0\" in About, now it shows \"Carrier: Not Available\".\r\niTunes did say \"Failed to check for carrier settings update\" (or similar), error code 1661.\r\n\r\nWhen testing with a SIM card issued by a \"known\" carrier (not the original carrier), Settings.app shows a version for \"Carrier\" in About.\r\n\r\nPhone Details:\r\n3GS 16GB iPhone.\r\nOriginally locked to T-Mobile Austria, unlocked through Carrier."
