    description: "Summary: When the Dock has a folder stack, and that stack is set to show in List view, and that list is set to sort by a Date (Added/Modified/Created), the list should start at the bottom and be reversed — with the most recent items at the very bottom near the Dock, and the \"Open in Finder\" button at the very top, always visible — this would make the List view consistent with the Fan view. This would make the List view just as useful as the fantastic Fan view but better for folders with more files than the Fan can handle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a folder to Dock\r\n2. View content as: List\r\n3. Sort by: Date Added/Modified/Created\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStack has newest content at the bottom, near the Dock and the pointer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStack has newest results at the very top, resulting in lots of mouse movement and confusion to the user who just wanted a bigger, scrollable Fan view."
