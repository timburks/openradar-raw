    description: "If MKMapView.userTrackingMode is set to MKUserTrackingModeFollow, the zoom level (or region.span) is managed by the system. This shouldn't be the case, at least not, if the developer sets a custom region.span (while keeping the userLocation in the center).\r\n\r\nOtherwise, applications that manage their region.span to fit map annotations cannot use MKUserTrackingModeFollow."
