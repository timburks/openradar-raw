    description: "Assigning a completely transparent PNG to UISearchBar.backgroundImage displays another roundRect with a different cornerRadius:\r\n\r\nhttp://d.pr/i/3Y7l\r\n\r\nI expected that the background would be hidden completely instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I also tried setting the tintColor of UISearchBar to [UIColor clearColor]. This doesn't work either and is equivalent to setting it to blackColor.\r\n\r\nI had to resort to view hierarchy manipulation techniques which is very ugly. So there should be an official API to display a UISearchBar without the bar background."
