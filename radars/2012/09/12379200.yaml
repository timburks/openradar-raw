    description: "26-Sep-2012 03:14 PM Chris Adamson:\r\nSummary:\r\nSettings application in Xcode's iOS 5.1 simulator cannot log in to Twitter\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Get Xcode 4.5 (Version 4.5 (4G182)) from Mac App Store.\r\n* Get the iOS 5.1 simulator as an optional download.\r\n* Launch the simulator, perhaps by running a project in the simulator.\r\n* Use Hardware->Version menu to set the simulator to iOS 6.0\r\n* Open Settings app\r\n* Tap \"Twitter\" settings\r\n* Tap \"Add Account\"\r\n* Enter credentials of a valid Twitter account\r\n[assuming username and password are correct, this account will be added to the list of accounts shown by the Twitter settings]\r\n* Use Hardware->Version menu to set the simulator to iOS 5.1\r\n* Open Settings app\r\n* Tap \"Twitter\" settings\r\n* Tap \"Add Account\"\r\n* Enter credentials of a valid Twitter account\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs in 6.0, the account is added to the list of authenticated Twitter accounts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlert: \"Error Signing In\" : \"The user name or password is incorrect.\" : [OK]\r\n\r\nI tried many, many, many times, with same credentials that worked in iOS 6 simulator. This isn't just 10 typos in a row.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSigning in to Twitter worked in previous versions of the Simulator. It also works when the simulator is set to version 6.0. It only fails for iOS 5.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
