    description: "I'm getting fed up of filing radars about documentation. Please try and fix whatever it is that is causing methods, protocols and even entire classes to not appear. Ever since Snow Leopard I've noticed various things not being documented. \r\n\r\nAt best they appear if you search on google, but not in the built in search index, which is a pain if you are using pre-release SDKs. Past examples have included rdar://9616852, rdar://9635071, rdar://9896538, rdar://9960938 and rdar://11768371\r\n\r\nOthers that I haven't yet reported include NSOutlineViewDataSource/Delegate being several years out of date, without any mention of any new 10.7 APIs, and NSNib which shows most of its methods being deprecated but doesn't show the new APIs that replace them.\r\n\r\nThis is the last radar I'm filing on this subject because it's obviously not a one-off problem. It is a systematic failure on Apple's part to write, generate and actually check documentation before deploying it. Surely an organisation with the resources of Apple can afford to pay someone to make sure that all new methods and classes are documented and accessible instead of us having to file radars and do the job for you. I can understand maybe not being like that during the beta stages, but when documentation for classes and methods is either non-existent, or two whole OS versions out of date it just becomes a joke."
