    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UK iTunes store displays the TV Shows tab of the mobile iTunes store as \"TV Programmes\" and consequently doesn't display properly on its tab. For those with poorer eyesight it can be near unreadable. People in the UK understand the word \"show\" perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nI've attached an image for reference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the iTunes store on an iPhone running iOS 6 on the UK store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA tab title saying \"TV Shows\" that displays correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA tab with an archaic localisation that affects usability.  See attached image.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
