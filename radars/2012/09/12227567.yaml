    description: "When creating a new Objective-C unit test subclass a .h file is created as well as a .m file.\r\n\r\nUnit Test cases are supposed to be self contained, run in isolation and not reference each other. People who care move the interface declaration into the .m file and delete the .h file.\r\n\r\nPlease can the generation of these .h files be stopped, or have an option to not create them."
