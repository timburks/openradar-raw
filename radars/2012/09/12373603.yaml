    description: "Summary: There's no simple way to set the link color for automatically detected links in UITextView. People are doing things like using a web view just to customize the link color, but that brings a whole new pile of problems to deal with, especially if you need the ability to toggle editing on and off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITextView\r\n2. Set dataDetectorTypes to UIDataDetectorTypeAll\r\n3. Set the text to something that will turn into a link, like \"http://apple.com\"\r\n4. Try to find a way to change the color of that link to anything other than bright, bright blue\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I'd expect to find something similar to the setLinkTextAttributes: method that NSTextView has. Or at the very least, in iOS 6, I would expect some way to manually look through the text attributes and change them from blue to some other color.\r\n\r\nActual Results: There's just no easy way to do this, as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: This would make me so happy I can't even tell you."
