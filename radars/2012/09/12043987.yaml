    description: "Summary: the new Navigation Voice in Maps doesn't take the region's language into account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: use Turn by turn navigation on a device which has the system language set to something different then the region's primary language. For example an iPhone with system language set to US English in Montreal, Canada.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Navigation Voice properly pronounces street names. Ex \"Turn right on <french street name>\"\r\n\r\nActual Results: Navigation Voice pronounces street names as if they were in english (making them inaudible).\r\n\r\nAn easy workaround for people that use their iPhone in their secondary language (the case of lots of people here in Quebec) would be to add a \"Navigation Voice Language\" setting to Maps, like it's the case for Siri. Although my phone is in english, Siri will understand me speaking french if I set the Siri Language to french."
