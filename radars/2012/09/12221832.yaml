    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nNSCollectionView should expose its animationDuration publicly. This would allow for adjustment of animation durations and also allow for the disabling of animations entirely.\r\n\r\nAt the moment there is no public way to disable a NSCollectionViews animations, which could at times be very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven Using an NSAnimationContext (below) does not seem to work.\r\n\r\n    [NSAnimationContext beginGrouping];\r\n    [[NSAnimationContext currentContext] setDuration:0];\r\n    [self setContent:updatedPics];\r\n    [NSAnimationContext endGrouping];"
