    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen installing OS X ML (10.8) on a mac protected by FileVault, the keyboard reverted to a US layout without notice.\r\nTook a while to realize it and find the right mapping for the keys of my password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Find a Mac with an ISO layout for example french, or german. \r\n- It has to have filevault for the whole disk activated. Choose a password containing a q an m and punctuations (?.,/+) etc\r\n- Upgrade to ML\r\n- When the computer reboots on first stage, you should get a FileVault permission screen before ML actually gets installed.\r\n- type your password, won't work\r\n- get into the activation key stage and type whatever you want to realize your KB layout is US/Qwerty \r\n- Remap the keys in your brain to type your password\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- on that stage the keyboard should be mapped to the preferences of the user (probably in the settings of the rescue disk)\r\nOR\r\n- indicate it is mapped to a US keyboard after 3 tries.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo info, confusion, fear, anger, hate, dark side.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPretty hard on reproduce on my side as I won't reinstall ML soon. I suspect it is in the boot rescue settings that the keyboard layout can accidentally revert to US Qwerty."
