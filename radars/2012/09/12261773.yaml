    description: "08-Sep-2012 04:29 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nSCNView and SCNLayer use significant CPU when idling, around 3-5%. A sample shows the view or layer is repeatedly polled about whether it wants to draw, and takes a seemingly-expensive lock each time.\r\n\r\nWith an SCNLayer (or layer-backed SCNView), calling [layer setAsynchronous:NO] allows the process to go completely idle. But then when something changes in the scene, no drawing takes place until -setAsynchronous:YES is called (or redraw is triggered some other way). As a workaround I'm exploring this, using app-specific knowledge to enable and disable drawing, but SCNView internally should have enough information to do this robustly."
