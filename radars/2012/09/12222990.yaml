    description: "Summary:\r\nSharing services should be able to take parameters for service-specific attributes. For example, the Compose Mail service should be able to take a list of recipients, a subject, etc. The Compose Message service should take a list of recipients, as well.\r\n\r\nThis could be as easy as exposing a \"parameters\" property on NSSharingService. The parameters could be secure coded across process boundaries through ShareKit, just as they are through XPC.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse NSSharingService. Be saddened by the fact that the Compose Mail service isn't nearly as useful as it is on iOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe services should be more customizable on a per-service basis. The shared items shouldn't be the only thing that's mutable.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n[service setParameters:@{\r\n    NSSharingServiceComposeMessageRecipientsKey: @[@\"jdoe@apple.com\", @\"logan@panic.com\"],\r\n    NSSharingServiceComposeMessageSubjectKey: @\"Here's the items for which you asked\"\r\n}];"
