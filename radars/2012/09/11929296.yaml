    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to generate a security-scoped bookmark for which you only have read-only access. e.g. something in the Pictures folder. Our code:\r\n\r\nNSData *bookmark = [bookmarkedURL bookmarkDataWithOptions:KSURLBookmarkCreationWithSecurityScope |  KSURLBookmarkCreationSecurityScopeAllowOnlyReadAccess\r\n                                     includingResourceValuesForKeys:nil\r\n                                                      relativeToURL:docURL\r\n                                                              error:&error];\r\n                \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI get back a bookmark which can be later used to restore read-only access to the file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBookmark creation fails and a sandbox violation occurs. Internally, the bookmark system tries to open the file for read-write access. Backtrace:\r\n\r\nThread 0:\r\n0   libsystem_kernel.dylib        \t0x93bab76e __open + 10\r\n1   CoreFoundation                \t0x94b8f812 -[NSURL bookmarkDataWithOptions:includingResourceValuesForKeys:relativeToURL:error:] + 114\r\n\r\n\r\n24-Jul-2012 10:55 AM Mike Abdullah:\r\nLots of detail can also be found at https://devforums.apple.com/message/702927"
