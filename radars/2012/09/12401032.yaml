    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a variant of -imageNamed: that can load paths outside of the application bundle, but still receive the benefits of in-memory caching and other artefacts provided by the original.\r\n\r\nCurrently, developers are writing their own implementations that do similar things to what -imageNamed: provides so that they can intelligently cache frequently loaded image resources into memory as they are used. A good example of this Indragie Karunaratne's SMKArtworkCache â€” https://github.com/indragiek/SNRMusicKit/blob/master/Content%20Sources/Shared/SMKArtworkCache.m\r\n\r\nCaching images into memory as they are used in a low I/O manner is a common scenario, and it would be great to have the framework provide this out of the box!"
