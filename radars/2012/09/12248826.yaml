    description: "Summary: When adding a photo of square proportions, Contacts requires the user to manually scale the picture. It also does not start at 100%. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Add contact. Drag in a photo with square proportions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: It auto-fits (i.e. scales down) to the required size, which works perfectly as a square image is required.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The user is presented a dialog with only a part of the dragged-in photo visible. The user than has to fiddle until the photo approximately fits the required size. This never works. \r\n\r\nNotes: As there is no indicator whether one has reached the correct size, photos tend to be a pixel smaller or bigger. This results in ugly display when a photo is shown on some background (like a white photo on a black background).\r\n\r\nThis is not even remotely a easy or nice handling. Adding photos is a huge pain in the ass, while the actual task would be 100% solvable in software."
