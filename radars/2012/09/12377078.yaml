        Xib files are really hard to diff. Part of the problem is that they contain a lot of data that can get updated just by looking at them.

        One possible solution could be to separate the data that is important from the data that is less important. An example of the latter would be the version number of the last version of Xcode to open he file. Then split each xib into a file package containing important.xml and notSoImportant.xml. The xib file should still be openable even if the notSoImportant.xml was corrupted.
