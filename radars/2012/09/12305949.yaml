    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ctrl-alt-cmd-eject method for shutting down the computer is inconsistent with other methods of shutting the computer down, in respect of the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose Apple menu > Shut Down, uncheck \"Reopen windows when logging back in\", and shut down.\r\n2. Restart the computer: no windows are opened.\r\n\r\n3. Press the power button, and press the Shut Down button in the \"Are you sure you want to shut down your computer now?\" dialog that appears.\r\n4. Restart the computer: no windows are opened.\r\n\r\n5. Press Control-Option-Command-Eject, to quit all applications and shut the computer down (see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2448).\r\n6. Restart the computer, and see if any windows are opened.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n7A. No windows should be opened, as the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" box is unchecked (earlier in step 1).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n7B. Windows are reopened."
