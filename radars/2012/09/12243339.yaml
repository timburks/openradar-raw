    description: "Summary: when adding GPX files to an Xcode project, those entries are added in arbitrary order to the location simulation menu. When using several GPXs files, specific entries become hard to find as there's no apparent order in which the entries are sorted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: add several GPX files to project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: GPX entries are displayed alphabetically (or in the order that they appear in the Xcode navigator) in the Location Simulation menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results: GPX entries are displayed in arbitrary order (and that order keeps changing when you add a new GPX).
