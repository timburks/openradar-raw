    description: "20-Sep-2012 06:21 PM Olivier Lacan:\r\nSummary: Several important point of Interest categories are missing from possible suggestions offered in the iOS 6 Maps app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n- Open iOS 6 Maps\r\n- Open Setting (page curl)\r\n- Tap \"Report a Problem\"\r\n- Choose Missing Location\r\n- Add Pin anywhere\r\n- Try to find the following categories: \"Web Development, Web Consultancy, Technology, Internet Services\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to create missing locations for Internet and Web businesses. The only categories vaguely matching this are: \"Professional Services, Internet Service Provider, Web Design\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing resembling the following businesses can be found: \"Web Development, Web Consultancy, Technology, Internet Services\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: The categories offered are poorly organized and much proper submission would be received by Apple if they were at least broken into main parent categories. See Foursquare & the late Gowalla for inspiration."
