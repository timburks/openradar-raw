    description: "08-Sep-2012 04:06 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nI explored the custom full-screen API on NSWindow (and NSWindowDelegate) recently, and found it woefully lacking. Initially, I simply wanted to make the window animate to its target frame, instead of cross-fading. However, I found no API or documentation about how to actually get the full-screen frame of the window!\r\n\r\nImplementing -window:willUseFullScreenContentSize:, I found it was never called for any windows I returned from -customWindowsToEnterFullScreenForWindow:. Even so, that only provides the size, and not the frame (accounting for multiple displays, avoiding the full-screen toolbar, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn other words, the current API allows applications to REPLACE the full-screen behavior, but doesn't provide the necessary information to customize it."
