    description: "Summary:\r\nDue to bug #12220933 (AVCaptureMovieFileOutput fails to export with larger than 720p frames), most users will feel like this sample application is broken. However, there's also another bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild & Run AVScreenShack 2.0 as downloaded from http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/AVScreenShack/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40011120\r\n\r\nHit the \"Set\" button to define a crop rectangle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor changes to a crosshair and the DrawMouseView is displayed, darkening the screen and allowing the user to select a region of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor changes to a crosshair but no control is shown.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked in AVScreenShack 1.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt looks like someone ran the convert to ARC tool and didn't test the app."
