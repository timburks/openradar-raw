    description: "The other day I was adding a text field to show the pixel count of a view. I wanted to display the result as \"4.3 MP\", meaning 4.3 Megapixels (the underlying value was 4,300,000 as a CGFloat). As such I added an NSNumberFormatter to the bound text field, and tried to set its multiplier to 1e-6. Unfortunately, Xcode / IB wanted to \"helpfully\" truncate that to zero, which is nonsensical.\r\n\r\nWith that having failed, I instead tried to use the runtime key-value attributes, adding a key-value pair of \"multiplier\" and number of 1e-6. There too, the number was truncated to zero.\r\n\r\nThis behavior makes sense if the value were, say, a pixel offset. However, for arbitrary numbers (and in particular the NSNumberFormatter's \"Multiplier\"), clobbering values is frustrating and often incorrect."
