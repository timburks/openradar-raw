This is not the case in Safari 6.0 under 10.8.1.\r\n\r\n[1] http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/os-x-10-8/3/#scroll-bars\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a page that scrolls both vertically and horizontally. Alternatively, zoom in on any page.\r\n- Scroll to the bottom right\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOverlapping scroll thumbs\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLion-style, non-overlapping scroll thumbs"
