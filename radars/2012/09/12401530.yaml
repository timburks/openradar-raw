        Especially since the 10.8.2 update, I've been seeing serious drawing issues in Safari. I often see "flickering" rectangles across packages that blink back and forth between white and page content. I also often see text disappearing as I try to type into form fields, only to re-appear again shortly or when the selection changes. Sites that have been triggering this lately includes: bugreporter.apple.com, our hosted FogBugz Instance, and MacUpdate.
