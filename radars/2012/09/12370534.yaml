    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Dvorak-QWERTY layout on OS X maps all keys to Dvorak, except when the command key is pressed, in which case it applies the QWERTY layout.\r\nThis usually works well in Safari, but NOT for CMD + G. Whenever I search for something in a page and press CMD + G to go to the next hit, Mail opens a new message with the content of the page. This shortcut is CMD + I (i), meaning Safari does not follow the system's Dvorak-QWERTY setting and incorrectly uses CMD + i when CMD + G should be used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open System Prefs > Language & Text > Input Sources\r\n- Select the Dvorak-QWERTY layout\r\n- Switch to this layout\r\n- Open any page in Safari\r\n- Hit CMD + F to search for something\r\n- Press CMD + G to go to the next hit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Safari highlight the next hit\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Safari opens the current page in the user's mail application. This is the effect of hitting CMD + i: i in Dvorak is where g is in QWERTY, meaning for this particular keyboard shortcut, Safari does not follow the system keyboard setting. All other shortcuts work as advertised (especially CMD + F in the same operation).\r\n\r\nDuplicate of #11658296"
