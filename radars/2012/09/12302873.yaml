    description: "14-Sep-2012 02:30 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary:\r\nPreview will get stuck \"Checking for unsaved changes before closing\" when trying to close a window with multiple documents that have been scanned.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Preview\r\n2. Goto File -> Import From Scanner -> Choose a scanner\r\n3. Scan a several documents [3 or more]\r\n4. In the Preview window with the documents, select all from the thumbnail preview on the left side.\r\n5. Goto File -> Export Selected PDF Documents  and save the file somewhere temporarily\r\n6. Now close the Preview Window with the red close button\r\n\r\nThe save dialog will popup asking \"Do you want to keep this new document?\"\r\n\r\nClick \"Delete\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Preview to not save any of the open documents and close the window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe progress bar progresses a ways and then gets stuck with the message \"Checking for unsaved changes before closing.\" Upon force quit and reopening, all of the documents are then reopened in separate windows that must be closed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a video of the bug exhibiting itself. This bug is _always_ reproducible on 3 or more documents. Preview appears to work properly on 1 or 2 scanned documents.\r\n\r\nThe step of exporting the selected PDF documents might not be required. I did not test without those steps, but if you follow the steps I list the bug is always producible.\r\n\r\nI'm using a Canon CanoScan 5600F, but this should not affect the behavior of this portion of Preview.\r\n\r\nI'm using Preview version 6.0 (765).\r\n\r\n14-Sep-2012 02:30 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'Preview Bug Reproduction.mov' and 'iMac.spx' were successfully uploaded"
