    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the Emergency Call button on the lockscreen is used, the Phone app gets bumped to the top of the multitasking bar. The vast majority of the times this button is used (for me at least) are the result of an accident when typing in my passcode. I don't need or want the Phone app in my multitasking bar when I'm trying to do other things.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Press the Emergency Call button\r\n2) Cancel\r\n3) Unlock the phone\r\n4) Open the multitasking bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be just as I left it before locking the phone\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOh my gosh there's a freaking Phone app in the first spot, why is Tweetbot not where I was expecting it to be? Now I've accidentally opened the Phone app instead of Tweetbot when trying to quickly get back to what I was doing. Curse this muscle memory! Arrrgg!\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has always happened. Please make it stop. Please."
