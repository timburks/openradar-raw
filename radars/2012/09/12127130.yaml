    description: "17-Aug-2012 05:49 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nI want to use the center method on NSWindow to center my window. (I use a menu option so the user may recenter the window.) It would be nice if it could be animated to move to the center if I use the animator. But this currently has no effect and the window immediately jumps to the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWith a simple program that has a pointer to the window, do:\r\n\r\n[[window animator] center];\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWindow should animate to the center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWindow instantly goes to the center."
