    description: "19-Sep-2012 12:14 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n==========================\r\nSummary:\r\n==========================\r\nH.264 encoded videos from applications such as Keynote and iMove yield washed out results.\r\n\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n==========================\r\nSee the attached video \"steps_to_reproduce.mov\" for a live demonstration of how to reproduce the bug. There is audio and I describe what I'm doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nExpected Results:\r\n==========================\r\nI expect the resulting rendered videos from these applications to have the same color performance as presented within the app themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nActual Results:\r\n==========================\r\nRendered videos look washed out and too light. See \"iMove Render.mov\" and \"Keynote Render.mov\" for the output that I demonstrate in the video.\r\n\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nRegression:\r\n==========================\r\nI have been irritated with this bug for over a year now. It was also a problem on OS X 10.7 releases. Additionally, from web searches it appears that this is a known outstanding problem since at least 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nNotes:\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nI have filed this bug as a QuickTime bug, but it may be a general OS X bug, or specifically related to each applications use of the APIs. Move as you find appropriate.\r\n\r\nI'm using OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.1 (12B19), Keynote '09 Version 5.2 (1125), and iMovie '11 Version 9.0.8 (1778).\r\n\r\nHere are discussions on various Web sites I found in my research. Some offer solutions, but I have not found any to work with the latest versions of OS X, primarily because QuickTime Pro is no longer available.\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2545461?start=0&tstart=0\r\nhttp://byteful.com/blog/2010/07/how-to-fix-the-h264-gamma-brightness-bug-in-quicktime/\r\nhttp://boardreader.com/thread/Washed_out_QuickTime_Export_7r43X1ik39.html\r\nhttp://forums.luxology.com/topic.aspx?f=34&t=38637\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3021962?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nand many many more...\r\n\r\n19-Sep-2012 12:14 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'steps_to_reproduce.mov' and 'iMac.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n19-Sep-2012 01:53 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'Keynote Render.mov' was successfully uploaded"
