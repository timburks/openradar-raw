    description: "19-Sep-2012 11:09 AM Neil Gall:\r\n1. Ensure the App Store and iTunes apps are not running, e.g. by killing from the dock\r\n2. From within an app open a URL that links directly to an app's reviews/ratings section in the App Store.\r\n3. Observe that this works.\r\n4. Close the store popover and return to the custom app, leaving iTunes and App Store in the background.\r\n5. Open the same URL again.\r\n6. End up at the front page of the app store with no popover.\r\n\r\n\r\n19-Sep-2012 11:35 AM Neil Gall:\r\nFurther testing shows that this affects iPad only and killing the iTunes app is not necessary to restore normal functioning for a review link - only the App Store app needs to be killed. See the attached demonstration project.\r\n\r\n19-Sep-2012 11:35 AM Neil Gall:\r\n'bug12327445.zip' was successfully uploaded"
