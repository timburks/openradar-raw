    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn iOS 5 and earlier, you could set your mapview delegate after annotations had been added to the map and be assured that mapView:viewForAnnotation: would be called for all annotations. \r\n\r\nOn iOS 6, setting the delegate too late means that annotations already added to the map will get a default annotation view, and the custom mapView:viewForAnnotation will not be called.\r\n\r\nThis results in pins with callouts with (for example) no accessory views.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAdd annotations to the map. Set the delegate later in the code. Check that mapView:viewForAnnotation has been called."
