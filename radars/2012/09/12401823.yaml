    description: "Summary:\r\nFor sites using...\r\n\r\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\">\r\n\r\n...launching from the home screen on the iPhone 5 results in a letterboxed presentation (rather than taking full advantage of the iPhone 5's screen height).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn the iPhone 5, in Mobile Safari, click the \"share\" icon in the bottom toolbar. Select \"Add to Home Screen\". Add. Launch the newly saved site from its home screen icon. It will be letterboxed.\r\n\r\nHere is a basic test:\r\nhttp://extrafantastic.com/junk/iphone5-webapp-test.html\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable' website saved to the home screen on the iPhone 5 should take full advantage of the vertical height of the iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable' website saved to the home screen on the iPhone 5 does not take full advantage of the vertical height of the device. It is instead letterboxed, appearing like an app that has not been optimized for the iPhone 5's larger display.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
