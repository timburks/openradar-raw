    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Safari has tabs open and you choose \"Open in Tabs\" from a bookmark folder, ALL open tabs get closed and the tabs in the bookmark folder are opened. This means you lose all open tabs and have to re-open them manually from the history. This leads to data loss as open tabs are like open documents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a couple tabs in Safari\r\n- Choose \"Bookmarks\" > \"Add Bookmarks for These Tabs...\"\r\n- Close the window and open some different tabs\r\n- Select \"Open in Tabs\" for the previously created bookmark folder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The open tabs stay open and new ones get opened\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- All open tabs disappear\r\n- The bookmarked tabs open\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nMaybe it's just me, but I rely on open tabs, even through restarts, to not forget certain things. Auto-closing tabs is a very bad thing. Other browsers like Firefox do not do this.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 3527122"
