    description: "In Interface Builder 3 you could enable the \"ID\" column in the xib document window (where all objects in the XIB are listed). Then you could search an object by it's object ID.\r\n\r\nThis was useful because when using the genstrings utility to export strings in a xib the object ID was the only way to locate that string again in the interface.\r\n\r\nThis method is heavily used in localization by us to find the context of strings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to search by an Object ID in the object list in a XIB in Xcode 4\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe object is shown\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing is shown"
