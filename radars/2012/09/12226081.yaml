    description: "03-Sep-2012 06:41 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nIn an Instruments profile of our project, the generation of mipmaps (glGenerateMipmapEXT_Exec) shows up as significant time. Therefore we'd like to use a lower-res material initially, have the mipmaps generated in the background, and then switch them in when they're ready.\r\n\r\nThe closest I'm able to get with current API is to use another SCNRenderer with a different, but shared, context. To prepare the material I set it on a plane in the second renderer's scene, and call -render on it. This works, but the renderer blocks the SCNView. Each renderer takes the global SCNTransaction lock.\r\n\r\nI suspect it may be possible to prepare a material (generate mipmaps, generate and compile shaders) outside of any rendering, which would be great.\r\n\r\nAlso see: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/164611"
