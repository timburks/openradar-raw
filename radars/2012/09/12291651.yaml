    description: "13-Sep-2012 07:47 AM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI am a member of two iOS Developer Program teams. I have just downloaded Xcode 4.5, and I am trying to download the Command-Line tools. When I try, I get an alert box with this error message:\r\n\r\n  myname@example.com does not have access to Command Line Tools.\r\n\r\n  Contact Apple Developer Support to resolve account access issues.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that \"myname@example.com\" is associated with a developer team for which the updated Program License Agreement has not yet been accepted.\r\n\r\nI am a member of another team for which that agreement has been accepted, but there is no way for me to force Xcode to consider that other team identity when deciding whether to allow the download.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nJoin multiple development teams, wait for an updated program agreement to be available, and then try to install Command Line Tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode should automatically check all team memberships to determine whether the user is allowed to download the Command Line Tools, or let the user choose a \"default team\" to be used when checking privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUser is blocked from downloading Command Line Tools, even though they are a member of a team which should have access to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
