    description: "23-Sep-2012 09:46 PM Martin Kopischke:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe hierarchy of groups in the iCloud-ified Contacts application (née AddressBook) makes the “any group” smart groups criterion unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable Facebook contacts integration and remove local and / or Exchange contacts accounts\r\n2. Enable iCloud contacts\r\n3. Create a contact in iCloud, making sure it is not assigned to any contact group\r\n4. Create a smart group, A, “card is not a member of any group”\r\n5. Create a smart group, B, “card is a member of any group”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGroup A contains the newly created card; group B does not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGroup A is empty; group B contains the newly created card.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n“All iCloud” is a master group of all cards in the iCloud account. As a result, all iCloud cards are always members of a group (easily testable by Opt-highlighting the card). Though this means the smart groups return the correct result formally spoken, that result is both non-intuitive (a user would expect “groups” in this context to mean “user created groups”, and the selection popup suggests so, with a list of user created groups followed by a list of accounts – not a hierarchy) and useless (if iCloud contacts are always in a group, what is the point of having the filter criterion “any group”?)."
