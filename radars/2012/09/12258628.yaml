    description: "07-Sep-2012 04:17 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing NSView's setFrameCenterRotation: method produces incorrect results when Auto Layout is enabled. The API is supposed to cause the view to rotate around the center of the view. But with Auto Layout enabled, it rotates around the bottom-left corner of the view. (setFrameRotation is supposed to rotate along the bottom-left corner, not setFrameCenterRotation)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached are two sample projects. \"RotateViewOld\" is without AutoLayout. \"RotateViewAutoLayout\" is with AutoLayout enabled in the XIB. The \"Old\" version shows the correct behavior. Note that the \"AutoLayout\" behavior does not match.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nButton should rotate around its center when you click the button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe AutoLayout version rotates around the bottom-left corner of the button.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think it is broken in 10.7 too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'RotateViewBug' uploaded at https://github.com/ewmailing/MyAppleBugs"
