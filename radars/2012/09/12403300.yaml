    description: "Summary: When the iOS Simulator is set to simulate a 3.5-inch iPhone (Retina or non-Retina) at 100% scale, a clickable Home button is provided as part of the simulator window. However, for other simulated devices and other scales, there is no Home button: the user must use the Hardware > Home menu item or the Shift-Command-H keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\nUse of the menu or keyboard shortcut can be clumsy, especially if the Simulator window is on a separate display. It would be nice if an in-window Home button control was provided for all simulated device types. This Home button could be added to the simulator window's title bar or the window could be extended to allow space for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Start iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\n- Choose the Hardware > Device > iPhone menu item, then choose Window > Scale > 100%. Note presence of Home button at the bottom of the iOS Simulator window.  The button can be clicked to show the Home screen, or double-clicked to show the multitasking bar.\r\n\r\n- Choose the Hardware > Device > iPad menu item. Home button is no longer present. Same for \"iPad (Retina)\" and \"iPhone (Retina 4-inch)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Home button should always be visible and easily usable with mouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: No Home button. Menu item must be used to simulate clicks/presses of Home button.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
