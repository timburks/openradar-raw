    description: "Summary:\r\n640x1136px images saved to a 320x480pt device (4S, 4, 3GS, 3G, iPhone) when setting as wallpaper, they do not fill the screen, instead they show the entire image and put black bars on the left and right of the wallpaper.\r\n\r\nThe issue here (I know it seems minor) is that wallpaper images made and tailored for these devices either have to be in two separate downloads or the user must scale up manually (reverse pinch) once in wallpaper mode, and will not have an accurately positioned and sized wallpaper for their device. Older devices should crop images to always display a fuller image, not show the entire image and leave black on the sides. I don't believe that's desired in any scenario. If a photo is taller than the display, it should be cropped on the top and bottom, not scaled to fit the image leaving black bars on the left and right of the user's home screen, lock screen, etc.\r\n\r\n*Luckily, a double-tap will fill the image, but I'd argue it should be reversed.*\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Save a 640x1136 image to a pre-iPhone 5 device's camera roll (http://lmnt.me/u/5test.png for example).\r\n2. Go to the Photos app, tap the action button, and set as wallpaper.\r\n3. The image scales down (from  fill screen to fit image) and displays black bars on the left and right of the wallpaper\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe photo/image/wallpaper retains its scale-to-fill screen in the wallpaper mode from the photo detail mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe photo/image/wallpaper scales down to fit image and displays black bars on the left and right.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
