    description: "Summary:\r\nIf hot corners are set, it's easy to accidentally trigger them in fullscreen because unlike normal windows, it's much more common for an interesting part of the window to overlap the hot corner.\r\n\r\nA nice feature would be to have an option so they only apply in normal space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith bottom-right hotcorner set to do something interesting:\r\nTake a window with a scrollbar into Fullscreen.\r\nScroll quickly to the bottom of the page with a mouse. The natural thing to do is overshoot, which puts the mouse in the hot corner.\r\nSee the hotcorner take effect.\r\n\r\nLikewise if you have the top-right corner set and you're aiming for the Exit Fullscreen button, you're just as likely to hit the hotcorner."
