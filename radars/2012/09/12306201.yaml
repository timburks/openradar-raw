    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nSee my dev forum post for background https://devforums.apple.com/thread/163808?tstart=0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDownload a Safari extension to local machine (Mac or Windows). Install extension (double-click, drag & drop to open Safari window, or from Safari go File->Open and select extension). Then see actual results below.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExtension (installer) file should be left alone after install to allow user to manually delete, move, or archive. Treat it same as with any software application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNotice that the source file used for installation is automatically deleted (not even moved to trash bin for recovery I believe).\r\n\r\nRegression: n/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHaving just worked with a Mac, assume this is in some way the Apple approach, as read in a different forum post and noticed that a Mac OS X upgrade/installer app (downloaded from App Store) will also be automatically deleted upon successful upgrade. To archive the upgrade/installer, you would have to manually back it up (or follow instructions found online to extract and burn installer to DVD) before installation.\r\n\r\nBut I do notice not all Mac software behaves this way. If you run third party installers, they still exist after installation.\r\n\r\nAnd for Safari extensions, in terms of Safari on Windows, I'm sure Windows users would not be familiar with this Apple concept. Since Windows does not generally do this, including OS upgrades.\r\n\r\n18-Sep-2012 04:31 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
