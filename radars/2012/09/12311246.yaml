    description: "17-Sep-2012 11:30 AM Michael Gorbach:\r\nMountain Lion has serious drawing issues with screen sharing, when used in certain configurations. These problems are being reliably triggered for me by trying to screen share into OS X 10.8.1 on a Mac Mini running under the VMware ESXI / vSphere hypervisor (ESXI v5.1, where 10.8 is a supported OS). Other people are also experiencing it when screen sharing directly into a Mac Mini not running ESXI. I think the issue may occur when the mac mini is not attached to a hardware monitor of its own. See attached image of the corruption in a screen capture of the screen sharing client.\r\nThis is a regression from 10.7.4. I have a 10.7.4 VM on the same Mac Mini ESXI server and it is not experiencing any problems while screen sharing.\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\nhttp://cloud.mgorbach.name/image/330H0o354142\r\n\r\nThe links below catalog other people experiencing the same issue.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=281252\r\nhttp://communities.vmware.com/thread/410162\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4155369?tstart=0"
