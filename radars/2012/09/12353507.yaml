    description: "Summary:\r\ni386 kernel extension binaries built by XCode 4.5 contain the loader commands LC_DATA_IN_CODE and LC_FUNCTION_STARTS. Neither of these is supported by kxld in kernels older than OSX 10.8. The kexts built this way are therefore rejected by OSX Lion, Snow Leopard, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open XCode\r\n- File -> New -> Projectâ€¦\r\n- Choose \"I/O Kit Driver\"\r\n- Complete the assistant\r\n- Set the target's deployment target to 10.7 or earlier\r\n- Set architectures to Intel 32/64-bit.\r\n- Build the 32-bit version (or a fat 32+64-bit binary)\r\n- Run the terminal command:\r\notool -lV -arch i386 /path/to/kext/Contents/MacOS/binary_name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo unsupported commands should be listed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNear the end, LC_DATA_IN_CODE and LC_FUNCTION_STARTS commands are present.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf you open and build the same project using XCode 4.4.1 or earlier, the produced kexts are fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- It does not matter whether XCode 4.5 is running on OS X 10.7 or 10.8, the produced kexts are always bad.\r\n- The 64-bit versions are not affected and do not contain the relevant commands.\r\n- An affected \"fat\" kext can be loaded on a 64-bit system, but it seems to interfere with kernel prelinking.\r\n- Relevant thread in the darwin-kernel mailing list: http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-kernel/2012/Sep/msg00025.html"
