    description: "20-Sep-2012 03:34 PM Terin Stock:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCertain Apple Lossless (ALAC) files do not stream via Shared Libraries. When one encounters these files, iTunes stops playback. Metadata and album artwork are correctly retrieved, just no playback. These same files playback just fine in the local version of iTunes and on my 4G iPod Touch.\r\n\r\nAs a representative of the files that don't stream, is the following description (as described by `afinfo`):\r\n\r\nFile:           Real Friends/Acoustic Songs EP/01 I've Never Been Home.m4a\r\nFile type ID:   m4af\r\nNum Tracks:     1\r\n----\r\nData format:     2 ch,  44100 Hz, 'alac' (0x00000001) from 16-bit source, 4096 frames/packet\r\nChannel layout: Stereo (L R)\r\nestimated duration: 103.919751 sec\r\naudio bytes: 10199766\r\naudio packets: 1119\r\nbit rate: 785106 bits per second\r\npacket size upper bound: 13563\r\nmaximum packet size: 13563\r\naudio data file offset: 40\r\nnot optimized\r\naudio 4582861 valid frames + 0 priming + 563 remainder = 4583424\r\nsource bit depth: I16\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe ALAC files that do stream are described:\r\n\r\nFile:           Five Iron Frenzy/The End Is Here/1-01 Cannonball.m4a\r\nFile type ID:   m4af\r\nNum Tracks:     1\r\n----\r\nData format:     2 ch,  44100 Hz, 'alac' (0x00000001) from 16-bit source, 4096 frames/packet\r\nChannel layout: Stereo (L R)\r\nestimated duration: 224.666667 sec\r\naudio bytes: 29883572\r\naudio packets: 2419\r\nbit rate: 1064057 bits per second\r\npacket size upper bound: 14414\r\nmaximum packet size: 14414\r\naudio data file offset: 622691\r\noptimized\r\naudio 9907800 valid frames + 0 priming + 424 remainder = 9908224\r\nsource bit depth: I16\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe key difference between the files that do stream and the ones that don't is the string \"not optimized\" versus \"optimized\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nLoad the two different ALAC types into iTunes, and on another computer attempt playback via Library Streaming.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBoth files stream successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe file described as \"not optimized\" do not play.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've not included any audio files, but could do so on request.\r\n\r\n20-Sep-2012 03:47 PM Terin Stock:\r\nI decided to go ahead and attach those two files, to make your lives easier. :)\r\n\r\n20-Sep-2012 03:51 PM Terin Stock:\r\n'rdar12340830.zip' was successfully uploaded"
