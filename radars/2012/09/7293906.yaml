    description: "11-Oct-2009 07:43 PM Christian Hofst√§dtler:\r\nSummary: \r\nTerminal should support 256 colors and they should be configurable. (This is an enhancement request.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Terminal with Pro profile\r\n2. Start vim\r\n3. Configure it to enable folding\r\n4. Use colorscheme desert\r\n5. Open a file with foldable text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFolded text should be displayed as a dark gray summary line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFolded text is displayed in black, completely unreadable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProbably not a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems like vim (and other apps) use the 'Black' color when gray is not available, causing gray text to be unreadable. It'd be cool if color support in Terminal could be enhanced, as in all other respects Terminal is already a great terminal, and superior to many other terminal emulators."
