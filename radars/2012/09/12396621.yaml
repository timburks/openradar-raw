    description: "For the purpose of supporting retina displays, Apple now advises the inclusion of certain \"@2x\" resources in an app icon set, such as icon_32x32@2x.png. This particular image should only ever appear on a retina display when a 32x32pt icon needs to be displayed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this icon is being used in application alert sheets in place of the expected 128x128px icon (scaled down). While a 32x32@2x icon is indeed 64x64 pixels, this icon is designed for display in Finder icon views, Notification Center and so on. It is not always, or even often, a perfect substitute for the 128x128 resource.\r\n\r\nAlert sheets should display a scaled version of the 128x128 icon. 32x32@2x icons should only be used where needed on a retina display."
