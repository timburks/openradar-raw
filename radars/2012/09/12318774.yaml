    description: "Summary:\r\nUIImagePickerController with UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera and allowsEditing misbehaves under iOS 6. When the user is asked to \"Move and Scale\" a photo captured in portrait orientation to choose what region to fit within the square crop area, the picture can't actually be moved - it bounces back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIImagePickerController, set its sourceType to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera and its allowsEditing to YES.\r\n2. Present it and take a photo in portrait orientation.\r\n3. In the next view (\"Move and Scale\"), try to move the image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image can be moved to choose what part to fit inside the square area.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image can't be moved, and bounces back.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bug was introduced with iOS 6. Works fine in iOS 5 and earlier. Tested on iPhone 4S and iPad 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUIImagePickerController *picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];\r\npicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera;\r\npicker.allowsEditing = YES;\r\n[viewController presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];"
