    description: "26-Sep-2012 02:35 PM Dan Kuehling:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect AppleTV to a 4:3 aspect ratio display supporting a 1024x768 resolution, such as an LCD projector.\r\n2. Set the TV Resolution in the Apple TV's Audio & Video Settings to \"1024 x 768 (60Hz)\"\r\n3. Turn on AirPlay Mirroring on an iPad 2 or 3, mirroring to that Apple TV.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGiven that the Apple TV is set to 1024x768 and the iPad 2 and 3 are both 4:3 native resolutions, the image from the iPad should fill the screen at the proper aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iPad's image appears horizontally \"squashed\" with black pillar-boxing bars on the left and right sides. See display in attached picture (connected to Apple TV), compare to iPad's screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nConnecting the iPad directly to the display via an Apple VGA Adapter or Apple Digital AV Adapter to the same display fills the screen properly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n It would appear that the Apple TV is taking the 4:3 image from the iPad, pillar-boxing it out to 16:9, and then \"squashing\" the 16:9 output back to 4:3. I understand that the Apple TV is natively a 16:9 device, but when set to a 4:3 resolution it should output the 4:3 signal from an iPad as is. \r\n\r\n26-Sep-2012 02:35 PM Dan Kuehling:\r\n'IMG_0143.jpg' was successfully uploaded"
