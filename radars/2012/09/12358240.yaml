    description: "Summary:\r\niPhone loses connectivity for push notifications, iMessage and ActiveSync. iPhone 5 on iOS 6.0 stops receiving push notifications and notifications from an ActiveSync account. I receive them on other devices. I am also unable to send iMessages.\r\nThe temporary resolution for this issue is to either power off/on the phone,or toggle Airplane mode. I then receive all my past notifications that had not come through and I am then able to send iMessages. Also, when I move from a No Service area like the subway to above ground it seems to accomplish the same thing. The problem then returns after a short period of time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the phone as normal. Notice that I am unable to send iMessages and not receiving any push or ActiveSync notifications.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to be able to send iMessages and receive push and ActiveSync notifications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhone stops receiving all notifications and loses the ability to send iMessages.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApple replaced my phone thinking that it may be a hardware issue but I am still experiencing the same problem with new hardware."
