    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now, if we receive a local/push notification while the app is foremost and visible, we are notified via the application:didReceiveLocalNotification: and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: methods but there is no way for us to show a notification banner. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch an app so it is foremost and visible, send it a push or local notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA banner (or alert, depending on the user settings) should be shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo banner or alert is shown\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt would be handy that either the notification alert/banner would show up according to the user's preferences or that an API to show banners would exist. \r\n\r\nIt would help 3rd party apps to notify the user in a consistent way. (For instance, Messages.app shows a banner if you receive a message while watching the pictures of a conversation). Chat apps would also benefit from this feature : messages received in another chat room could be notified to the user in a consistent, unobtrusive way : via a banner."
