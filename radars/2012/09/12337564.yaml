    description: "20-Sep-2012 12:28 PM Josh Adams:\r\nSummary: I am using a Cirago Bluetooth USB Dongle in my MacBook Pro, running OS X Version 10.7.5 with Xcode 4.5 (4G182) and iPhone Simulator 6.0 10A403. When I try to connect to a BTLE peripheral in the iPhone 6.0 simulator I call [centralManager connectPeripheral:peripheral options:nil] and I never get the didConnectPeripheral callback invoked or the didFailToConnectPeripheral callback either. This works perfectly in the iPhone 5.1 simulator every time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fire up my attached sample app and run it in the iPhone 6.0 Simulator. I have taken the Apple TemperatureSensor example and made one change to it: instead of passing in an NSArray of UUIDs which contains the UUID for the Temperature Sensor's service (which I don't have) I call scanForPeripheralsWithServices and pass in nil so that all BTLE devices show up. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Attempt to connect to a BTLE device for the first time (the peripheral's UUID should be null because it is not cached) by tapping on the row when it shows up in the sample app.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n The idea is that I should then be able to tap on the row with my Heart Rate Monitor and see it say \"Connected\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt never actually connects nor does it invoke the didFailToConnectPeripheral method.\r\n\r\nFollow the same steps in the iPhone 5.1 simulator and observe how it connects.\r\n\r\nIdentical behavior has also been observed on a MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n20-Sep-2012 12:28 PM Josh Adams:\r\n'TemperatureSensor.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n20-Sep-2012 12:41 PM Josh Adams:\r\nInterestingly enough, even though the iPhone 6.0 simulator can't connect, my iPhone 4S running iOS 6 GM can succesfully connect. Still, it would be very helpful for my team and I to be able to test this in our iPhone 6.0 simulator."
