    description: "Summary:\r\nDue to an unfortunate set of circumstances, it is impossible to bind keyboard shortcuts to create a window of a particular profile in Terminal\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Go to the Application Shortcuts section of the Keyboard Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard prefpane in System Preferences\r\n- With reference to what the profiles are called in the 'Shell > New Window' submenu, create a keyboard shortcut for, say 'Silver Aerogel'\r\n- Focus Terminal\r\n- Press your keyboard shortcut\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new Silver Aerogel window\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI assume that this problem is due to the fact that there are a bunch of identically named menu entries in the 'Shell > New Tab' submenu. If this is the case, I can completely understand an unwillingness to commit to ambiguous instructions. Still, this is something I do often enough that keyboard shortcuts would really speed things up.\r\n\r\nPossible fixes I can think of include:\r\n- Completely redesign the keyboard shortcut assigning system please pretty please\r\n- Provide a mechanism for binding such keyboard shortcuts in Terminal's own preferences"
