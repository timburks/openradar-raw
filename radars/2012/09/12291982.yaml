    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I use to query the ASL for messages it works fine as long as the caller is not sandboxed.\r\nIt fails in sandbox mode\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nI use asl to get ALL messages with:\r\nloglevel doesn't matter\r\nprocessIdentifier = %OWN_NAME%\r\ntime = %SINCE_YESTERDAY%\r\n\r\n    aslmsg query = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_QUERY);\r\n    asl_set_query(query, ASL_KEY_SENDER, [applicationName UTF8String], ASL_QUERY_OP_EQUAL);\r\n    asl_set_query(query, ASL_KEY_TIME, [sinceString UTF8String], ASL_QUERY_OP_GREATER_EQUAL);\r\n    aslresponse response = asl_search(NULL, query);\r\n\r\n=> it works on ios and on non-sandboxed osx\r\n=> it doesn't work when sandboxed\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nrun attached sample and toggle sandboxing in the entitlements file\r\nOR add a an exception to the sandbox:\r\ncom.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.absolute-path.read-only = \"/\"\r\n(home relative doesnt work, guess it needs /var/ or /Library/)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nit should work in both cases especially when the specified SENDER_KEY is equal to the own process name\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nit works for iOS and non-sandbox. it fails when sandbox"
