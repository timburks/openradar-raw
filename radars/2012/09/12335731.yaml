    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen doing a dictionary lookup in a text view with attachments, the selection for the looked up word may be shifted. For instance, the attached file (Sample.rtf) contains two images. When selecting a word after the images (e.g. the word \"or\") and looking up the dictionary entry for the word (using the context menu or the shortcut), the selection is shifted one character to the right and the lookup is done for the string \"r \".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached RTF document in TextEdit.\r\n2. Select the word \"or\".\r\n3. Do a dictionary lookup for the selected word. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn overlay for the dictionary entry \"r \" is displayed (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn overlay for the dictionary entry \"or\" is displayed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe number of shifted characters seems to depend on the text in front of the word. Sometimes, the selection is shifted to the right, sometimes to the left."
