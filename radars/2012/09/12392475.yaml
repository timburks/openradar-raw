    description: "27-Sep-2012 09:12 PM Evan Long:\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter using Xcode for 10-30 minutes tab switching is very slow\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open 3-5 tabs in Xcode. Keep these tabs open and work for about 10-30 minutes (possibly less time).\r\n2. Periodically switch tabs. Notice the time to switch might take about 1 second of time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwitching tabs should be very fast.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwitching tabs is very slow. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis appears to be a regression since 4.4.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRestarting Xcode fixes the issue. Tab switching is fast again.\r\n\r\nOther users appear to have similar issues and have posted to Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12624391/very-slow-tab-switching-in-xcode-4-5-mountain-lion\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample collected with Activity Monitor and it appears that a good chunk of time is spent on the main thread in `selectTabViewItem:` which makes sense. \r\n\r\nI have disabled antialiased font rendering. So that I can use Courier New.\r\n\r\n27-Sep-2012 09:12 PM Evan Long:\r\n'slow_tab.txt' was successfully uploaded"
