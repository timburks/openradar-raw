    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen using code snippets like \"[<#class#> release], <#class#> = nil;\" when I tab to select the replacement token \"<#class#>\" and have it replaced by \"MyClass\" all occurrences of \"<#class#>\" should be replaced by \"MyClass\" without me having to manuall tab to each one and start typing again. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsee above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll occurrences of a same-name replacement token should be replaced simulataneously.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the currently selected token gets replaced.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorking fine in Xcode 3.2.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a good feature to have because it reduces typos. Especially if a developer finds it annoying having to tab to each one manually and therefore wants to get it over as soon as possible."
