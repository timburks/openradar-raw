    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe attached project crashes due to an over-release when built with compiler optimization turned on (-Os), but does not crash when compiler optimization is turned off (-O0). The project is being built against the iOS 6.0 SDK that was shipped with Xcode 4.5 (4G182) with the Apple LLVM compiler 4.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Inspect the problem-causing code in AppDelegate.m in the attached sample project.\r\n2) Run the attached Xcode project with optimization turned off. Note that the no crashes occur.\r\n3) Run the attached project with optimization set to -Os\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect that no crashes would occur.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app crashes when num2 is over-released. Enable Zombie Objects to confirm that this is the case.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding of ARC, this code should not lead to any objects being over-released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpted sample code:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t// This crashes under -Os, but not under -O0\r\n\tNSNumber *num1 = @((float)arc4random() / (float)UINT32_MAX);\r\n\tNSNumber *num2 = @((float)arc4random() / (float)UINT32_MAX);\r\n\r\n\tNSNumber *foo1 = num1;\r\n\tNSNumber *foo2 = num2;\r\n\r\n\tfor (NSUInteger i=0; i<2; i++) {\r\n\r\n\t\tNSLog(@\"foo1: %p %@\", foo1, foo1);\r\n\t\tNSLog(@\"foo2: %p %@\", foo2, foo2);\r\n\r\n\t\t// swap foo1 and foo2\r\n\t\tfoo1 = num2;\r\n\t\tfoo2 = num1;\r\n\t}"
