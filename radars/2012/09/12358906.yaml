        I've been bitten by code incompatibilities when using the iOS 6 SDK. They're not entirely unexpected: some relate to rotation methods, some to a few other things. After the current development cycle of the apps I'm working on, I'll surely modify them to work. However, I can't change the schedule of a client project in the middle of a release, so currently I'm stuck with the iOS 5 SDK, which means I need to keep around Xcode 4.4.

        I think each version of Xcode should support the current SDK and also the previous major SDK version. At the moment, we should be able to choose between 5.1 or 6. Next year we can use 6 or 7. The current situation doesn't work well with longer development cycles, or ones planned further in advance, which in turn leads to shallower apps.
