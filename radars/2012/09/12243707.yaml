    description: "Summary:\r\nCalendars cannot be deleted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to delete a calendar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCalendar disappears on all devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalendar reappears on device where deleted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on iOS 5 (current), iOS 6 b4, Mountain Lion, iCloud.com, beta.iCloud.com\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDeleting subscribed calendars caused them to re-appear in the normal iCloud calendar section with no events.\r\nThere is a calendar called \"Calendar\" that also keeps appearing (not a subscription) that I never created and will not go away.  The calendars have become superhuman!  Better find out a way to kill them fast before they become sapient and turn into SkyNet!"
