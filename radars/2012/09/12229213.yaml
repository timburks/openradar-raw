    description: "Summary:\r\nI don't like my computer making noises unprompted. The Sound prefpane lets me demonstrate this by turning a single slider down to the bottom to silence all UI noises.\r\n\r\nNotification Center does not respect this. Instead, I must roll through the list of apps and disable each one manually. Even after I have done this, new apps that want to notify me of things will make noises by default"
