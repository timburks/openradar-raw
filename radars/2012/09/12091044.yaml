    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe notice this in our testing of our website on Safari on iOS devices, particularly the iPad (iOS 5.1).\r\n \r\nWhen visiting HTTPS pages (say checkout, my accounts, login), it will display for the browser window (or more correctly, the browser tab) title text using the SSL certificate's owner (that's typically the name of the company/organization that paid for and owns the certificate issued by whatever issuing authority).\r\n \r\nOn visiting regular HTTP sites, Safari shows the expected page title defined by the HTML tag.\r\n \r\nThis only happens on mobile Safari of course. The desktop Safari shows expected page title, and has section in address bar to show certificate owner which you can click for more details.\r\n \r\nIs this expected and by design? If so, what is the rationale behind this? Unless this is publicly and well documented, this will just end up confusing users and developers. If it is documented, I hope this documentation is easy to find, including for end users.\r\n\r\nI did some further testing, and the issue doesn't affect all sites. You could say it may be specific to \"something\", but what this is we should find out. I think it could be related to how the SSL certificate is issued or configured (issuing authority, how installed, server platform, etc.). Also think this may not occur for self-signed certificates (we didn't see it in our internal test environments using the self signed certs).\r\n \r\nWhat I found is mentioned in steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHopefully, this reproduces for others as well, these are public sites (below) to test against. Best way to test is to access an HTTPS page on the site, typically the sign in page to start with. Can also try cart, checkout pages on the sites. Login page is easiest since you don't need an account to land on the page.\r\n\r\nGo to the pages on these sites using mobile Safari (preferably iPad), then observe the tab title.\r\n\r\nReproduces for (me at least):\r\n \r\nwww.tinyprints.com\r\nwww.weddingpaperdivas.com\r\nwww.treat.com\r\nwww.ebay.com\r\n \r\nDoes not appear to reproduce for:\r\n \r\nwww.shutterfly.com\r\nwww.amazon.com\r\n\r\nExpected Results: should show page title specified by the HTML.\r\n\r\nActual Results: sometimes shows the SSL certificate owner name instead.\r\n\r\nRegression: don't know\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n13-Aug-2012 04:58 PM David Luu:\r\nPrior to submitting this bug, I posted to an Apple forum for discussion first. This might be helpul:\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3941962"
