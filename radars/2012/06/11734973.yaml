    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMy app, Wine Navigator Plus, is a wine and food matching app. It has good reviews, has had plenty of downloads and has been on the App Store a long time. On typing \"wine\" into the App Store it has always been appearing about #11. Now it's appearing around #90 below apps like iBeer which clearly has nothing to do with wine.\r\n\r\nThe first appearing app is called \"Wine*\" and (in the UK at least) has no ratings, looks awful and is probably not as relevant as other apps below it.\r\n\r\nIn the US App Store we (and other wine apps) appear even lower - below Springpad, BeThere Deals, Pocket Cocktails and more - all apps with not much link to wine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch for \"wine\" on the App Store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nRelevant apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA mixed bag of apps that include those with little or no relevance to wine."
