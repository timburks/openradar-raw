    description: In Mountain Lion Developer Preview 4, a new dock style was implemented. Myself and many other developers all really love this new dock. It fits much better with the new OS refinements. iOS has had the same dock for some time now. I think iOS is due for a new dock refinement like OS X. I've designed mockups inside of Photoshop with Mountain Lions dock style on the iPhone and it looks really nice.
