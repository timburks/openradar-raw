    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf the user last used the Emoji keyboard and a UITextField with keyboardType set to either UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad or UIKeyboardTypeDecimalPad, the Emoji keyboard will be displayed until the user taps the world icon, at which point the keyboard displayed will change to the one for the keyboardType set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a UITextField and set the keyboardType to either UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad or UIKeyboardTypeDecimalPad. \r\n\r\n2. On device, in a normal text field (I use the search bar on the iPhone search screen), switch the keyboard to the Emoji keyboard\r\n\r\n3. Run the app and make the UITextField active. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. The requested numeric keypad would be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. The Emoji keyboard is displayed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nThis appears to be the only international keyboard this happens with. I've tested coming from the Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese keyboards and everything works as I would expect. \r\n\r\nThis also is only testable on device as the simulator doesn't allow for multiple keyboards.\r\n\r\nI've provided a sample project that can be run on a device to test this. Interestingly, before changing keyboards, you can run it and leave one of the text fields active showing the correct keyboard. Hitting the home button, going to the search screen and switching to the Emoji keyboard, then double-tapping the home button and selecting the test app, when you get back you can see the number pad type keyboard switch to the Emoji one. Again, this does not occur with any other international keyboard type."
