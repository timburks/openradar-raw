    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIActionSheet's behavior does not conform to HIG as stated in header.\r\n\r\nIn the UIActionSheet header line 121 you find the following:\r\n\r\n\"// adds a button with the title. returns the index (0 based) of where it was added. buttons are displayed in the order added except for the\r\n// destructive and cancel button which will be positioned based on HI requirements. buttons cannot be customized.\r\n- (NSInteger)addButtonWithTitle:(NSString *)title;    // returns index of button. 0 based.\r\n\"\r\nThe problem is that if you manually add buttons and set the value of the cancelButtonIndex or destructiveButtonIndex propertyâ€”the behavior described in the header shown above is not followed. Instead the buttons show in the order they are added.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a project that manually exercises UIActionSheet. Lucky for you I have already done this. :)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect that the buttons will show in their proper positions as stated in the header.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe buttons appear in the order added.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSample code project is attached.\r\n\r\n31-May-2012 11:49 PM Michael Ledford:\r\n'UIActionSheetTest.zip' was successfully uploaded"
