    description: When working with Storyboards in Xcode I (and fellow developers) have noticed that scenes will disappear from the grid/canvas when the Storyboard is re-opened. After the initial alarm that everything has been lost subsides the scenes can be individually re-displayed by clicking the view controllers individually. This is inconvenient due to it's time-consuming nature.
