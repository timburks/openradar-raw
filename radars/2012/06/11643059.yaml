    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an app that provides personalized radio stations. I allow the user to control the music with the Apple IR remote. Pressing and holding the up (+) and down (-) buttons on the remote rates the song or down, respectively. \r\n\r\nI would like tapping the up (+) and down (-) buttons to provide the default behavior of raising and lowering the system volume, including displaying the on-screen bezel (see attached screenshot). Outside the sandbox, I achieved this by posting an NX_KEYTYPE_SOUND_UP or NX_KEYTYPE_SOUND_DOWN via IOHIDPostEvent . But this is no longer inside the application sandbox.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I now need to implement a common function (changing the system volume) in a custom, non-standard way.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways that this and similar system functions could be made available for developers:\r\n\r\n1) Provide more fine-grained registrations for HID callbacks, so that an app can register only for taps, or only for press-and-hold events.\r\n\r\n2) Provide a way to pass-through HID events that an app chooses not to handle.\r\n\r\n3) Provide a way to synthesize system events that have a user-visible response, such as the volume buttons on the keyboard and remote, eject button, brightness controls, etc.\r\n\r\n4) Provide a way to synthesize the user-visible responses for those actions (like the volume bezel, attached).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:"
