    description: "26-Jun-2012 12:01 PM Jonathan Hirz:\r\nSummary: When you go to the updates tab in the App Store (iPhone) and see your list of which apps have updates, there is a 'What's New' button or text line that you can click on. When you click on it, the update description drops down, then almost immediately slides over to the app's main page, giving the user no time to read the update unless they click the 'Updates' button to go back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen App Store (with an update available)\r\nClick Updates Tab\r\nClick 'What's New' on any update\r\nWatch the update info slide away\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpdate info should stay visible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking 'What's New' takes you to the app's main page\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
