    description: "Summary:\r\nUIViewController and UINavigationController do not go the whole nine yards when setting their respective viewControllers properties.\r\nIn addition, the children of these view controllers never seem to change their isMoving{From|To}ParentViewController state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached test project on iOS 5.0 to iOS 6.0 simulators (phone or pad, doesnâ€™t matter) or devices taking a look at the console output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- At least at some point in the logs, there should be a message for \"didMoveToParentViewController:\".\r\n- At least at some point in the logs, \"isMoving{From|To}ParentViewController\" should be \"YES\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- \"isMoving{From|To}ParentViewController\" is always \"NO\".\r\n- \"didMoveToParentViewController:\" is never called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBug occurs regardless of SDK since the introduction of view controller containment.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
