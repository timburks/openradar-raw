    description: "When using the iOS simulator, holding the option key brings up little white circles to indicate where each finger would be.  This is a great feature.\r\n\r\nWhen mirroring an iPhone or iPad to a Mac or Apple TV using AirPlay or when connected directly to a TV or monitor using the HDMI or VGA adapter it is very difficult for viewers to see where the presenter is touching the screen.  I'm requesting an option to show similar white circle be shown on the mirrored display while a touch occurs on the actual device.  This would be extremely useful when recording or presenting demos on the device so that viewers can completely follow the presenter's actions."
