    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA large memory leak happens when using the Core Image Unsharp Mask filter in a Quartz Composer composition.  It only seems to happen if the filter's image input is another Core Image filter.  It only happens on the Intel 3000 graphics card (new Macbook Air (and others?).)  It only happens when the unsharp mask filter's Radius input is set to 0.  Obscure, yet. But when running a Quartz Composer, it leaks about a gigabyte of virtual memory every 10 seconds.  Once hard disk space is exhausted, the system will hard freeze and you'll have to reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached Quartz Composer composition on one of the new MacBook Airs.  Open Activity Monitor and look at the process's Virtual Memory in the memory tab. You'll see it going up very rapidly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt should not leak virtual memory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt leaks about a gigabyte of virtual memory every 10 seconds.  Once hard disk space is exhausted, the system will hard freeze and you'll have to reboot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- Doesn't happen on my MacBook Pro. Probably related to Intel 3000 graphics card.\r\n- Doesn't happen if the unsharp mask filter's input is not another core image filter.\r\n- It only happens when the unsharp mask filter's Radius input is set to 0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nYikes! You can also reproduce this simply using the Sharpen composition as well because that uses the Unsharp Mask filter internally.  \r\n\r\nSimple qtz file showing the leak is attached."
