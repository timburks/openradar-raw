    description: "17-Jun-2012 12:05 PM Nico Weber:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt used to be possible to have a view that draws its background with \r\n\r\n    [[[self window] backgroundColor] set];\r\n    NSRectFill(dirtyRect);\r\n\r\nand then the view would be \"invisible\" on a textured window. This worked in HiDPI mode up to OS X 10.7.3. In 10.7.4, the object returned from -backgroundColor isn't really related to the actual window background color, and views drawn that way are very visible. (This is also why the background color of the active tab in Terminal.app looks ugly in HiDPI mode.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Run the attached sample program (pattern/pattern.app).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt looks like a textured window with no obviously visible view (pattern/pattern-lodpi-10.7.3.png, pattern/pattern-hidpi-10.7.3.png).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe view is clearly visible (pattern/pattern-hidpi-10.7.4.png)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes, this used to work in 10.7.3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis breaks tab drawing in Terminal.app and in Google Chrome (http://crbug.com/133229)\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2012 12:05 PM Nico Weber:\r\n'pattern.zip' was successfully uploaded"
