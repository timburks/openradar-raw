    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTurning on Wi-Fi sync on an iOS device sometimes cause the device's media collection (music and video) to become inaccessible such that the Music and Video application shows a \"no music\" and \"no video\" screens, respectively. The issue tend to happen when the last sync process had transferred a large amount of data over Wi-Fi -- which occurs after a large number of applications in the library were updated or many music/video files were altered (as in metadata change or new music files).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Turn on Wi-Fi sync on iTunes (Mac OS X 10.7.4 host, iOS 5.1.1 client)\r\n2. Consistently use Wi-Fi sync every day for at least two months and never use USB sync.\r\n3. There will be a good chance that a sync session caused the music and video collection to vanish from the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWi-Fi sync is 100% reliable and will not cause sync issues like this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAbout every six weeks or so of syncing exclusively via Wi-Fi, a sync session would corrupt the device's Music and Video libraries.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis rarely happens with USB sync.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe test machines are:\r\n\r\n    * A Macbook Air (2011) with Mac OS X 10.7.4 & iTunes 10.6.1 (7).\r\n    * An iPad 2 with iOS 5.1.1\r\n    * An iPhone 4 with iOS 5.1.1"
