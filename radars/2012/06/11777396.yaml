    description: "Summary: \r\nI've been trying to put my finger on just where Messages is going wrong, but it goes wrong in so many bizarre ways that I've given up. It's simply cursed, as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch Messages.\r\n2) Chat with your colleagues. Maintain several chats. Some one-on-one, some group.\r\n3) Quit the app and return. Or just leave it running for a while, really.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessages should always maintain a perfect log of every message in the order they were received. This log should never vary from session to session. See: every other IM app ever created.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe demons inhabiting Messages go to town, scrambling or erasing messages at random. Conversations become jumbled or nonsensical. The user begins to question her own sanity."
