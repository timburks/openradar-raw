    description: "Summary: after user picture was set in Address Book for a certain contact, it can't be deleted after that\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a new contact in Address Book application.  Set contacts picture (double click on user picture which is located in top-left corner of contact details).  Try to clear that picture, i.e. set a contact to a previous state when there was no picture assigned to it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Picture is removed and contact is restored to a state when there was no picture assigned to it.\r\n\r\nActual Results: there isn't any control to remove a picture from the contact.  It is impossible.\r\n\r\nRegression: this bug is also present in Mac OS X Snow Leopard, but it is absent on iOS 5.1.1, as it is perfectly possible to remove picture from a contact in iOS.  So this bug can be considered a regression."
