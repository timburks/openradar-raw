    description: "14-Jun-2012 05:19 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nI tried to do a \"po dict\" on the lldb command line in Xcode with \"dict\" being an NSDictionary with a pretty large structure of keys and subkeys.\r\n\r\nlldb doesn't print the content and doesn't indicate in any way that it timed out.\r\n\r\n(lldb) po dict\r\n(NSDictionary *) $16 = 0x0f58f750 [no Objective-C description available]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen instead I do a \"po [dict allKeys]\" it works just fine. According to [redacted] with whom I sat down in the WWDC lab that's because of a timeout in LLDB to prevent Xcode's variable printing taking too long.\r\n\r\nOn the command line,  no timeout should be set because operations can take an arbitrary long time."
