    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nProvide developers a way to publicly respond/comment on App Store reviews, similarly to Ebay's system where sellers can respond to buyers' reviews.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Get a patently FALSE 1-star review as an app (worst case scenario: within a day after app release)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n2. Respond to this review, explaining why it's false.\r\n3. Potential customers see your response and ignore the review.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n2. Be unable to respond or otherwise defend yourself against this review.\r\n3. Watch sales go down sharply due to the (FALSE) 1-star review"
