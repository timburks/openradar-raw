    description: "Summary: \r\nThe documentation for launchd.plist does not include the SessionCreate property. Setting this key to 'true' is necessary for daemon processes controlled by launchd to be able to access keychains other than System.keychain\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Type 'man launchd.plist' or go to http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html\r\n2. Search for 'SessionCreate'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA section describing the SessionCreate boolean and what it does\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo results are found\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf it wasn't for the following stack overflow post and the wonderful Apple engineer who pointed me to it, I never would have known about this option:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6827874/missing-certificates-and-keys-in-the-keychain-while-using-jenkins-hudson-as-cont#answer-9482707"
