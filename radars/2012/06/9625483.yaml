    description: "Many view controllers, including the AddressBookUI stuff, MFMessageComposeViewController etc. use barButton items with UIBarButtonItemStyleDone. It would be desirable to customize the appearance of those buttons differently than for UIBarButtonItemStylePlain buttons using the appearance proxy feature.\r\n\r\nI assume, this additional method inUIBarButtonItem:\r\n\r\n- (void)setBackgroundImage:(UIImage *)backgroundImage forState:(UIControlState)state barMetrics:(UIBarMetrics)barMetrics style:(UIBarButtonItemStyle)style\r\n\r\nplus an analogous getter would do the trick."
