    description: "11-Jun-2012 11:41 PM Michael Herring:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf the GameKit authentication prompt is cancelled, future attempts to authenticate will not have their completion handlers called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the GKTapper sample code app from developer.apple.com\r\n2. Set a breakpoint at line 145 in GameCenterManager.m.\r\n3. Debug on an iOS 5.1 device (or the Simulator).\r\n4. Tap \"Cancel\" at the authentication prompt.\r\n5. Note that the breakpoint is hit, then continue execution.\r\n6. Tap \"Try again.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe completion handler should be called again after authenticateWithCompletionHandler exits.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nauthenticateWithCompletionHandler seems to execute, since it generates \"enter/exit\" log output. But, the Game Center authentication prompt never comes up, and the breakpoint set in step 2 above will never be hit a second time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nMy co-worker reports this is a 5.1-exclusive regression, but I have not confirmed that.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis reproduces on the iOS 5.1 Simulator, as well.\r\n\r\n17-Jul-2012 09:07PM Michael Herring\r\nNo, the issue only occurs on iOS 5.1."
