    description: "The current documentation for [ALAssetRepresentation fullScreenImage] says:\r\n\r\n„In iOS 5 and later, this method returns a fully cropped, rotated, and adjusted image—exactly as a user would see in Photos or in the image picker.\r\n\r\nTo create a correctly-rotated UIImage object from the CGImage, you use imageWithCGImage:scale:orientation: or initWithCGImage:scale:orientation:, passing the values of orientation and scale.“\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph only pertains to iOS 4, but it’s not really clear from the wording. The second paragraph would better read:\r\n\r\n„In iOS 4, use imageWithCGImage:scale:orientation: or initWithCGImage:scale:orientation: to get a correctly-rotated UIImage object from the CGImage, passing the values of orientation and scale.“"
