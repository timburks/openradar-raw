    description: "20-Jun-2012 09:18 PM Tim Davies:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe ability to open an applications install directory from iOS simulator via a menu item in the menu bar is much needed for those writing apps that make use of the install directory folders.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCurrently there is no facility provided in either Xcode or the iOS simulator. Instead you have to log the documents path out to the console:\r\n\r\nNSLog(@\"%@\", [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) lastObject]);\r\n\r\n and copy the file path from there and open that path with finder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat there would be a much simpler/faster one-click solution to opening the install location for apps in the simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such facility.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n20-Jun-2012 09:18 PM Tim Davies:\r\n'LogOutMyPath.zip' was successfully uploaded"
