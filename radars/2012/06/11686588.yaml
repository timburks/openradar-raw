    description: "18-Jun-2012 01:32 AM Raymond Farnham:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMKOverlayViews do not completely hide when their hidden property is set to YES after a pinch to zoom operation has taken place. Failure appears in the iOS 6 simulator, the retina iPad running iOS 6 beta 1, and iOS 5.1 on iPad 2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Run attached demo program\r\n2) You should see a straight red line running from the Northwest to Southeast through Texas\r\n3) Pinch to zoom (in or out)\r\n4) Press the \"Toggle Overlay\" button (toggles the .hidden property of the overlay view)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOverlay should be completely hidden.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA cached version of the overlay appears from a different zoom scale (or so that is what the result looks like to me).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n18-Jun-2012 01:32 AM Raymond Farnham:\r\n'MKOverlayViewFailsToHide.zip' was successfully uploaded"
