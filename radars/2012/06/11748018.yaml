    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWebKit's implementation of the JavaScript function \"dataTransfer.getData\" does not return the paths to the dragged files, as on OS X 10.6 and 10.7. This causes problems for web-authoring apps, which allow users to edit web pages by dragging image files onto a WebView.\r\n\r\nThis does happen with all kinds of apps, no matter if they have been \"sandboxed\" or not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the attached HTML file in Safari and drag an image file on the green rectangle. In previous version of Mac OS X the file path will appear in this area, once the drag operation finishes.\r\nOn 10.8 (12A256) there will be no data of any type in the JavaScript dataTransfer object.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file path should appear after a drop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo data appears after a drop.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n26-Jun-2012 01:28 PM Paul Hecker:\r\n'DragDropTest.html' was successfully uploaded"
