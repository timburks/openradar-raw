    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing storyboards to produce a really simple app view controller sequence, seems like you'd often want to conditionally activate a segue.  There seems to be no clean way of canceling a segue.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose:\r\n\r\nadd a cancel property to UIStoryboardSegue.  If set to yes inside of prepareForSegue: the segue will not be performed."
