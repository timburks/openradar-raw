    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTurning on Wi-Fi sync on an iOS device often causes sync issues such that on the next sync iTunes forces the user to restore the device. There is no way to sync the device without relegating iTunes to have its way.  This causes data loss up to the last backup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Turn on Wi-Fi sync on iTunes (Mac OS X 10.7.2 host, iOS 5.0.1 client)\r\n2. Consistently use Wi-Fi sync every day for at least one month and never use USB sync.\r\n3. There will be a good chance that iTunes forces you to restore the device up to the latest backup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWi-Fi sync is 100% reliable and will not cause sync issues like this (refer to attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAbout every three weeks or so of syncing exclusively via Wi-Fi, iTunes would force the user to restore the iOS device via backup.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis rarely happens with USB sync.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe test host machine is a Macbook Air (2011) with  Mac OS X 10.7.1 & 10.7.2.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of Bug ID: 10218300"
