    description: "I'm using the first beta of iOS6.\r\nI tried to move an app icon (Mail.app) to the 4-icon-dock where there were\r\nalready 4 apps. I dropped the app, and it disappeared. It didn't go back to\r\nits original folder, nor to the end of the list. Restarting the device also\r\ndidn't fix it.\r\n\r\nHope this is useful. Feel free to ask for any additional information that I\r\nmight have forgotten to add.\r\n\r\nThanks."
