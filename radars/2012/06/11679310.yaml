    description: "15-Jun-2012 01:03 PM Tobias Hieta:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn our application Plex (based on XBMC), we see that users who have upgraded to 10.7.4 are having problems with digital audio over HDMI. When playing a movie that outputs AC3 or DTS audio over HDMI audio is looped when pressing pause.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPlay Digital Audio (via CoreAudio) to the HDMI port, stop writing new audio frames to the interface without closing down the connection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLast sample loops over and over again until we either write new samples or you close the connection.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBug only happens on 10.7.4 with HDMI port. Other version of MacOSX doesn't seem affected and it works as expected over Optical Audio.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOur code is open source and available at github: https://github.com/elan/plex/blob/laika/xbmc/cores/AudioRenderers/CoreAudioRenderer.cpp\r\n\r\nAnd: https://github.com/elan/plex/blob/laika/xbmc/osx/CoreAudio.cpp"
