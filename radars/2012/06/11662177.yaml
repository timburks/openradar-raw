    description: "I'm debugging this snippet of code of a UIView subclass:\r\n\r\n74: - (void)layoutSubviews {\r\n75:    \t[super layoutSubviews];\r\n\r\n\r\nI set the breakpoint right in line 74 and try to \"po self\" using LLDB. I get this:\r\n\r\n(lldb) po self\r\n(MenuEntryViewCell *) $2 = 0xbfffd408 [no Objective-C description available]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I instead break in line 75, everything is fine and I get my description.\r\n\r\nI can understand what you're doing here internally but as an end user I think this is confusing and not the \"right\" behavior from a user's perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n22-Jun-2012 12:51 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that you don't have skip-prologue turned off in lldb.  I.e. you should get true as in:\r\n\r\n(lldb) settings show target.skip-prologue\r\ntarget.skip-prologue (boolean) = true"
