    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have favicons shown in safari tabs and \"Bookmarks Bar\" menu items (without the need for a 3rd party hack like glims (http://www.machangout.com). Any power user (heck, *most* users) will have multiple tabs open simultaneously. The icon is much more visible and recognizable than having to scan text titles in tabs. \r\n\r\nBesides being recognizable, favicons in the \"Bookmarks Bar\" also can shorten the space needed by a bookmark given you often don't need to type in a bookmark name when the favicon exists.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
