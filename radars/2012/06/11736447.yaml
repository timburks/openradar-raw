    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCheaters run unrestricted on game center. This creates an unenjoyable environment for players. As  game developer, I may want to avoid using game center as a result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshot for an example. One of the top players of Pocket Planes has 9.223372 Ã— 10^18 flights. This is basically impossible.\r\n\r\nTo do it yourself does NOT require jailbreaking. Even if it did, I believe it is Apple's responsibility to remove ALL cheaters from game center, even those with compromised devices. It is worth noting that this is also Microsoft's policy with xbox live (this is an idea I'll return to).\r\n\r\n1. Download iExplorer.\r\n2. Edit the plist or sqlite db of a game you want to hack\r\n3. launch the game, which will report your phony stats to game center\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIdeally, the cheaters are banned from game center, forcing them to create a new account and start fresh in *every game*. \r\n\r\nHere's an article on MS's effective policy: http://gizmodo.com/372164/microsoft-branding-xbox-live-cheaters-for-life-like-sex-offenders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCheaters run rampant.\r\n\r\nAs a result, my game may not use game center. I'll just track achievements myself, and ban/wipe cheaters."
