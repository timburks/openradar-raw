    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"CFNetwork Programming Guide\" is such a useful resource — but it does not mention the CFProxySupport API anywhere. That's a shame because it's not only a nice and simple API, but it's also the only (sane) way of getting that information on iOS, where the SCDynamicStore functions are unavailable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen and read the TOC of the \"CFNetwork Programming Guide\" looking for the section on \"Working With Proxy Servers\", eventually reading the sub-section \"Navigating Firewalls\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's a nice little passage telling you \"hey look, we have this great API to determine the current proxy configuration and even query on a URL basis\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Navigating Firewalls\" tells you about an API which does not exist on iOS and which — on any platform — would require you to include yet another framework into your project :-(\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
