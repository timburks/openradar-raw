    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nRemoving a CALayer of a view from its super layer causes any access of the view to throw a EXC_BAD_ACCESS. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add a view as a subview of another view\r\n\r\n2. Loop over the super view's layer's sublayers and call -removeFromSuperLayer\r\n\r\n3. Try to access any property of the subview or call a method on the subview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEverything continues to work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nEXC_BAD_ACCESS is thrown on any access of the view as it's CALayer is now invalid\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nUIView's documentation states that it's layer property is retained. Removing just the layer from its super layer should not release the layer to the point of it being deallocated since UIView should still have a retained reference to it.\r\n\r\nThe content being removed from the super view is expected as the CALayer is where it's actually being drawn, but the memory being deallocated was unexpected.\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached. Run the app in the simulator (or a device). Tap \"Add View\" and then tap \"Access View\", which will work fine. Then tap \"Remove Layers\" and then tap \"Access View\". Crashtastic."
