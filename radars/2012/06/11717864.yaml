    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen assigning a UIColor's CGColor to a CGColorRef for later use then ARC discards the UIColor too early when running on device.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached sample project.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApp should run equally well on Simulator and Device. ARC should not release the UIColor before the end of the scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApp runs ok on Simulator, but crashes on Device with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis was working fine before using it in a project without ARC since the code in question does not use NSObjects for anything except to create the two CGColorRefs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA workaround is to save the UIColor in an IVAR to establish a strong reference. When doing this the exception no longer occurs. Another workaround apparently is to immediately CGColorRetain the CGColor."
