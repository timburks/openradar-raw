    description: "Summary: Using UIImageView or CGImageCreateWithJPEGDataProvider to decode a large, progressively encoded JPEG takes much longer than expected with high CPU utilization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing a full screen progressively encoded JPEG for retina resolution on the iPad  is the easiest way to reproduce this issue. I have a test program available on Github that shows three different images getting decoded and displayed. The progressively encoded jpeg is marked.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sujal/Image-Tester\r\n\r\nBuild and Run the program on an iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The time taken would be longer than a non-progressively encoded JPEG, but not orders of magnitude longer. For example, the baselines encoded JPEG takes around 100-200ms to decode. I would expect, based on my understanding the spec and progressive JPEGs at smaller sizes, that it might take 500-800ms.\r\n\r\nActual Results: My testing shows that it consistently takes 2-3 seconds at least.\r\n\r\nNotes: I did not test at very granular sizes of images, but it *feels* like there's a size at which performance suddenly degrades. But, we only have handy images at certain sizes. I only see the issues with the full 2048x2048 jpegs."
