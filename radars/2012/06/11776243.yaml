    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up an NSFetchedResultsController to feed an UITableView with Sections and Section Index Titles for the first time, performFetch: takes a long time.\r\nAfter Debugging for a while I noticed that there are two SQL Statements executed: one for the objects and another to fetch the section titles. Both Queries together take up to a few seconds (3GS, 1800 entries to be fetched).\r\nAs using another thread for performFetch: is not allowed by the documentation the UI will hang while the fetch is running.\r\nThat situation is not very pleasant for us developers, especially if a workaround is known and not documented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild a Core Data dataset with roughly 3200 entries, where 1600 are to be fetched into 26 sections.\r\nSet up a fetched results controller and call performFetch either:\r\n1. without a cache name\r\n2. for the first time with a cache\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA fast fetch which doesn't stutter the UI and doesn't leave the user in a unresponsive UI while fetching.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI is blocked and the User has no feedback on what's happening.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis Text has been updated to remove information optained under NDA"
