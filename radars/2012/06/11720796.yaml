    description: "21-Jun-2012 01:54 PM Anders Kierulf:\r\nSummary:\r\nAnalyze reports an issue when there's no issue. Only happens when a constant is declared outside of a method and based on another constant.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun Analyze on the following code:\r\n\r\n// Declaring this here will causes Analyze to fail, claiming the value assigned to 'temp'\r\n// is garbage or undefined. If MaxPoint is declared as 19 directly, Analyze is happy.\r\nconst int MaxSize = 19;\r\nconst int MaxPoint = MaxSize;\r\n\r\n- (void)analyzeFailure\r\n{\r\n   // If the same declaration is moved within the method, Analyze is happy.\r\n   // const int MaxSize = 19;\r\n   // const int MaxPoint = MaxSize;\r\n\r\n   int point[MaxPoint];\r\n\r\n   for (int i = 0; i < MaxPoint; i++)\r\n\t{\tpoint[i] = 1;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n   int temp = point[0];\r\n   assert(temp);\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnalyze should not report any issues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAnalyze claims the value assigned to temp is garbage or undefined.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMinimal sample project including this code is attached."
