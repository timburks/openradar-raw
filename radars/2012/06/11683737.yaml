    description: "There should be a means to create plugins for Interface Builder to support comfortable configuration of\r\n\r\n- custom view classes that provide a preview of how they actually will draw for WYSIWG layout, default constraints that could be configured using the size inspector and should not be visible like the normal constraints would, and UI elements for adjusting other aspects of those objects without the indirection of using the “User Defined Runtime Attributes” which is error prone\r\n- controller objects — especially view controllers with support for associated layout elements e.g. requiring the view to be of a special class.\r\n\r\nThis would go a long way towards making reusable custom components easier to deal with.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis functionality was present in the standalone Interface Builder before Xcode 4 — although for Mac development, only."
