    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to view some items in a Google Calendar in MobileCal.app, the app crashes when showing the Day view on the iPad or details on iPhone. The appointments that cause crashes appear to all come from MS Exchange sources.\r\n\r\nThis problem is reproducible on multiple devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add a Google Calendar account to your iOS device.\r\n2. Have an MS Exchange used send a meeting request.\r\n3. Accept the request via the browser-based interface in Google Calendar.\r\n4. Open MobileCal.app and navigate to the day for the appointment. View Day view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should not crash when showing appointment details.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app crashes when viewing the detail or day view for the problem appointments. \r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nRemoving the appointments from the calendar resolves the crash.\r\n\r\nAlso, adding the same item to the Google calendar via an ICS file with iCal (rather than accepting the appointment directly in the browser) also appears to resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nThis problem is not reproducible with locally created or other Google Calendar-created appointments.\r\n\r\nThe attached file includes the crash stack trace from an iPad. Additionally, an ICS file for an appointment that causes the issue has been attached.\r\n\r\n18-Jan-2012 10:49 AM George White:\r\nThis issue continues to occur. Again, it only happens with appointments originally scheduled via Ms exchange and accepted in a google calendar."
