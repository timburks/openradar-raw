    description: "15-Jun-2012 02:38 PM Roman Busyghin:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt is hard to localize XIB files because strings files generated by ibtool doesn't contain meaningful comments\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with XIB file that contains some UI elements (e.g. buttons, labels)\r\n2. Run \"ibtool --export-strings-file file.strings file.nib\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGenerated strings file should contain meaningful comments for translators\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGenerated strings file contains something like this:\r\n/* Class = \"IBUIButton\"; normalTitle = \"Wave!\"; ObjectID = \"12\"; */\r\n\"12.normalTitle\" = \"Wave!\";\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is how ibtool works now and I'd like you to change this behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur translators don't understand such a comment: Class = \"IBUIButton\"; normalTitle = \"Wave!\"; ObjectID = \"12\"; ibtool will fail to import strings file if we change that comment right before submitting strings file to translators."
