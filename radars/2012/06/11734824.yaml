    description: "23-Jun-2012 10:02 PM Doug Russell:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCurrently NSOperationQueue has a method for adding block operations:\r\n\r\n- (void)addOperationWithBlock:(void (^)(void))block;\r\n\r\nwhich offers no reasonable way to access the operation thats created from within the block which makes testing for canceled unreasonable.\r\n\r\nNSOperationQueue should either change addOperationWithBlock: to include the block operation or add a new method like the following:\r\n\r\n- (void)addBlockOperationWithBlock:(void (^)(NSBlockOperation *op))block\r\n{\r\n\tNSBlockOperation *blockOperation = [NSBlockOperation new];\r\n\t__weak NSBlockOperation *weakBlockOperation = blockOperation;\r\n\t[blockOperation addExecutionBlock:^{\r\n\t\tblock(weakBlockOperation);\r\n\t}];\r\n\t[self addOperation:blockOperation];\r\n}\r\n\r\nHere's an implementation done via a category\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/231K170D3G453c0E0T0K"
