    description: "25-Jun-2012 07:02 PM Jonathan Hirz:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile performing an OTA software update, the 'gears' animate and spin. It appears that left most gear should be spinning in the opposite direction that it does, if the gears are supposed to connect and interact.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPerform an OTA software update, watch the animation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLeft most gear should spin counter-clockwise.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLeft most gear spins clockwise.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot a breaking issue, but it's one of those small details that makes Apple products great."
