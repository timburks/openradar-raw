    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe ADC AppleID password field has disabled paste operations. The HTML for\r\n\r\nhttps://daw.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSAuthWeb.woa/wa/login\r\n\r\ncontains the following attributes on the paste input element:\r\n\r\n    onpaste=\"return false ;\"\r\n\r\nIf this is meant as some kind of security measure, it's naive. Apps and Safari Extensions such as 1Password walk the DOM to insert this info all the time, and can't be stopped from doing so. It also seems extremely unlikely that a malicious individual would script the browser to perform a user-level paste operation, let alone be deterred by this sort of thing. All the above markup does is aggravate honest iOS users with strong passwords who store them in an external utility, then paste them into Safari when needed.\r\n\r\nI log into many websites on a daily basis. ADC is only one that has this silly restriction. Please remove it. You're not protecting anybody."
