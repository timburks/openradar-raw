    description: "Summary: Apps that are archived in the Xcode organizer (in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/) should be compressed or stored in some manner that forces them to be ignored by the OS. I've been having more and more problems where archived apps are getting registered for URL schemes, AppleScripts, Spotlight importing, and so on. It's extremely frustrating and a simple change like storing the apps in zip files would solve it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app in Xcode.\r\n2. Choose Archive from the Product menu.\r\n3. Make some changes to the app.\r\n4. Choose Archive from the Product menu.\r\n5. Click the \"Distribute…\" button to save out another copy of the app.\r\n6. Move that version to your Applications folder, desktop, etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The latest version of the app should get registered for any URLs, AppleScripts, Spotlight importing, and so on. Any archived copies of the app (in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/) should be completely ignored… they shouldn't get used for these purposes, show up in the \"Open With\" menu when opening a file, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Good luck getting predictable behavior without deleting or at least manually compressing all your archived apps.\r\n\r\nRegression: As far as I know this has always been an issue with the archive system\r\n\r\nNotes: As a nice side effect, compressing the apps would also save some space. I'd prefer to see iOS apps handled in the same way—the other day I had the system try to launch the iOS version of my app when I was testing an AppleScript."
