    description: "23-Jun-2012 08:33 PM Lee Morgan:\r\nSummary:\r\nRequest to have bar button items in UINavigationBar that persist between UIViewControllers.\r\nAdding a bar button item to a UINavigationBar and setting a flag (i.e. UIBarButtonItemIsStatic) would cause the item to persist between presented views.\r\n\r\nThis would be beneficial for navigation items that should appear on multiple UIViewControllers.\r\ni.e. a \"Now Playing\" button.\r\nRather than having to add the item in each ViewController the NavigationBar would take care of it.\r\n\r\nFinally, to keep the proper appearance the bar button item shouldn't animate (move) when transiting between ViewControllers."
