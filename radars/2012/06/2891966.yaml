    description: "01-Apr-2002 06:48 PM Rich Siegel:\r\nBoot a machine running Mac OS X. Observe that the disk icon looks vaguely like an old Quantum hard drive, with a yellow-green LED on the right-front corner (as viewed by a user facing the screen).\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. No currently produced hard drive mechanism has an LED set into the leading edge of the drive mechanism. Moreover, my internal hard drives are either Seagate or IBM mechanisms (with the occasional Maxtor), and none of them look like the hard drive pictured in the allegedly photorealistic icon. (As a side note, the 2-inch drives used in PowerBooks don't look remotely like the icon.)\r\n\r\nIt would be very nice if Icon Services sensed the type of drive whose icon was being displayed, and modified the icon accordingly.\r\n\r\n:-)"
