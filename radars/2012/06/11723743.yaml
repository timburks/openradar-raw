    description: "21-Jun-2012 09:18 PM Felipe Kellermann:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe iOS Simulator application fails completely and silently to save screenshots when the user's date format contains UNIX path separator (aka '/'). This means a path separator is missing somewhere. I found the problem by looking the console logs, where a part of the file name was being exposed:\r\n21/06/12 21:04:19,789 iPhone Simulator: Failed to write screenshot (The file “2012 21.04.19.png” doesn’t exist.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change the OS X date format to any formatting that uses UNIX path separator in dates (e.g.: Brasil, Portugal, Spanish, many others).\r\n2. Restart Xcode / iOS Simulator.\r\n3. Try to use the \"Save Screen Shot\" feature (Command-S).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA file saved in ~/Desktop (or com.apple.screencapture) containing the screenshot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, the \"Save Screen Shot\" fails silently.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nVery annoying to change the system date format to save some screnshots. Many users are complaining in the official/unofficial foruns trying to fix the issue."
