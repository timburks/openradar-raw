    description: "01-Jun-2012 10:34 AM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nConnecting a Bluetooth headset via USB completely shuts down Bluetooth on the Mac, even if the headset is turned off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use a Mac which has at least one Bluetooth device connected\r\n2. Get a Bluetooth headset which can be charged by USB. Plug it in to one of the Mac's USB ports.\r\n\r\nNote: Do NOT attempt to pair the headset with the Mac, or turn the headset on. These steps are not necessary. The steps reflect only an attempt to charge a BT device via USB.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBluetooth would continue working normally on the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Mac immediately loses connections to all Bluetooth devices. Disconnecting the headset does not restore the connections. The Bluetooth menu item contains a single grayed out entry reading \"Bluetooth: Not available\". Bluetooth hardware utilities (Bluetooth Explorer, Bluetooth Diagnostics Utility) report that Bluetooth is unavailable. System Information reports \"No information found\" in the Bluetooth section.\r\n\r\nIf the affected Mac has only Bluetooth keyboards and mice, it becomes impossible to interact with the Mac except via Back to my Mac. (Testing was done on a MacBook Air specifically due to the difficulty in getting details of the system state on an iMac with only a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse).\r\n\r\nRebooting the Mac restores normal operation, if the headset is not connected. It's the only way I've found to get Bluetooth back to normal.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnclear. I have not used a Bluetooth headset in over year and have never used the current model until yesterday. I didn't notice the problem previously but I would have been using a different headset and a different version of Mac OS X at the time. It would have been the same Macs, though.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. The headset used in testing is a Motorola Finiti. It's shown in the attached system profile, in the USB section, as \"Stealth K2\".\r\n\r\n2. The attached system profiles are from a MacBook Air (MacBookAir2,1). Identical results were obtained on a 2010 iMac (iMac11,3).\r\n\r\n3. Other than the issue described in this report, Bluetooth works normally on both tested Macs.\r\n\r\n4. USB continues to operate normally. I mention this because it was suggested to me that the problem relates to overloading the USB port's power capabilities. USB is not affected when this problem occurs, only Bluetooth.\r\n\r\n5. The attached zip file contains the following information:\r\n\r\nConsole-connect.txt: Console messages that appear when connecting the headset\r\nConsole-disconnect.txt: Console messages that appear when disconnecting the headset.\r\n\r\nTwo folders, \"No BT\" and \"Normal\" which contain the same files generated when BT is not working and then again after rebooting:\r\n\r\n* \"MacBook Air.aspx\": System profile\r\n* \"BT Menu.png\" : Bluetooth menu screenshot\r\n* \"Bluetooth Diagnostics Utility.png\": Opening screen of the Bluetooth Diagnostics Utility app\r\n* \"Bluetooth Explorer.png\": for the no-Bluetooth situation, a dialog reporting \"No Bluetooth hardware found\". For the normal situation, a screenshot showing Bluetooth Explorer's Device Discovery window.\r\n\r\n\r\n01-Jun-2012 10:34 AM Tom Harrington:\r\n'Archive.zip' and 'MacBook Air.spx' were successfully uploaded"
