    description: "21-Jun-2012 09:15 PM Arjen van Bochoven:\r\nSummary: Using AD to store MCX policies requires that the correct items are found in AD. In Lion the search base changed to CN=MAC OS X, domain root. As it was never required to store things like ComputerLists in this root container, our AD has these stored somewhere else.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Extend AD with Apple schema as outlined in http://www.seminars.apple.com/contactme/pdf/L334436B_ActiveDirect_WP.pdf\r\nCreate a container like OU=OSX, dc=domain, dc=tld, create a computerist in this container, add some preferences to this list using WGM\r\nBind a 10.7 OSX client to AD, add the client to the above ComputerList using WGM, log into the client, check MCX using mcxquery\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should see the prefs set through wgm\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n'no data found'\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n10.6.x clients see the ComputerlLists and act on them normally\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is the Search Base key in \r\n/System/Library/OpenDirectory/Templates/Active\\ Directory.plist\r\nchanging the key to \"%!\" restores the required behaviour"
