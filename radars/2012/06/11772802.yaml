    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for a web browser to be set as default for URLs besides Safari. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIdeally an app could register as being able to open web URLs, allowing users to select alternate browsers to Safari for opening links.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nObviously, this problem is now more interesting due to the recent launch of Google Chrome for iOS. However, there are many other browsers - iCab is my favorite - that offer a different and more tailored browsing experience than Safari. It's not for everyone, but having the choice is very desirable."
