    description: "When an exception is encountered in a background thread, I don't see the description of the exception anywhere in the debug log.\r\n\r\nI've enabled \"break on exceptions\" and it correctly breaks when the exception is encountered. I can somehow work around this by going to the first frame of the back trace and do a \"po $eax\" (for the Simulator). Nevertheless it should be printed right away in the log."
