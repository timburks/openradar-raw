    description: "04-Jun-2012 04:50 AM Roman Busyghin:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn general I would like to remove CALayer from layer hierarchy after animation attached to this layer is finished. To do this I've configured CABasicAnimation and set its delegate to my view. However I can't detect my animation correctly because first argument in these delegate methods is not equal to my animation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch attached sample code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApplication should not crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication crashes because of NSAssert.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is one of my first steps in learning Core Animation and I didn't notice it previously."
