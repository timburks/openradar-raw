    description: "Summary:\r\nI administer several computer labs.  When a Mac App Store software update occurs, currently I have to go around to each workstation, log in, launch App Store, log in again, and run updates.  This is boring and takes a long time.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see a command-line executable that allows me to run Mac App Store software updates, which I could then automate using Apple Remote Desktop."
