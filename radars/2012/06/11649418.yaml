    description: "When i'm running Xcode with my company I'm using more than one account. I have my personal account with which I have access to WWDC downloads, I have my boss's account to be able to build Ad-Hoc builds and I have my client's account with which I build the app store releases.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 4.4 and 4.5 whenever I tried to update or download updates/simulators, it never asks me for my account, instead it tries with the last account I logged in with in 4.3 and since it's not my personal account, I can't download anything.\r\n\r\nI want the ability to switch account whenever I need through the preferences for example. Or even have an option to be asked every time which account I want to run with a nice popup menu to go fast to whichever account I want."
