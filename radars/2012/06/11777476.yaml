Open TextEdit (or any other editing app).\r\n2. Select \"Special Charactersâ€¦\" from the Edit menu.\r\n3. Search for \"magnify\" in the Characters dialog.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe left pointing and right pointing magnifying glasses are mirror images of each other.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe baseline is different, and the transparency of the lens appears to be different as well.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThere may be a good reason for this difference, but it seems odd."
