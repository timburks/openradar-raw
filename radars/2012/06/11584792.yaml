    description: "04-Jun-2012 10:42 AM Mark Aufflick:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe Xcode plist editor is the standard way to edit plist files which are an important part of application configuration. Not only is it lacking basic outlining commands (eg. move row up/down), what is available is inconsistent and tricky to use (eg. commands that appear in context menu are not in the Editor menu, and it's very tricky to use the mouse/trackpad to drop a row quite where you want it)\r\n\r\nAs Apple and third parties have delivered excellent outlining tools since the Apple ][ I won't perform the injustice of enumerating what I think is essential in an outlining editor and instead leave it to your brilliant UI designers and developers :)"
