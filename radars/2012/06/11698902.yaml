    description: "Summary: During the install reboot required by a 10.8 OS install, my Mac loses track of the fact that I'm running with a Dvorak keyboard. Filevault kicks in early in the boot process, requiring a password to unlock the disk. It requires this password in Qwerty. Since I've moved my keycaps, I have to type in the Filevault password blind, or looking at another Qwerty keyboard for reference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Set up a Mac with 10.7, make sure to turn on Filevault and select the keyboard as \"Dvorak\" during installation so that it's the expected keyboard of the root user.\r\n- Notice that rebooting under 10.7 will correctly use the Dvorak keyboard with Filevault to unlock the disk.\r\n- Install 10.8 DP4 on this disk, and reboot when requested.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Filevault window appears, should unlock when password is typed using a Dvorak keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Filevault window appears, won't accept password typed using Dvorak keyboard. Will accept password if typed as if the keyboard is Qwerty.\r\n\r\nRegression: Appeared in 10.8; unsure if it appears earlier than DP4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- Because the password field is concealing the letters typed, it can be hard to figure out what's going on. Years of Dvorak keyboard use as a developer have gotten me used to this sort of bug, but it could be very difficult for eg. a non-developer AZERTY keyboard user."
