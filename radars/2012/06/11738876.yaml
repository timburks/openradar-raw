    description: "Summary:\r\nSince SLRequest implements an OAuth signature provider for basically arbitrary web services, all HTTP verbs that are routinely used in RESTful web services should be supported.\r\n\r\nThis includes first and foremost the verbs PUT and DELETE that are usually used for creation and deletion of resources in the Create-Read-Update-Delete way of doing REST.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot Applicable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot Applicable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot Applicable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem already existed in the Twitter framework, that was introduced in iOS 5.\r\nIn that case, this didn’t matter as Twitter’s web API abuses path components to implement creations and deletions—which is a shame.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
