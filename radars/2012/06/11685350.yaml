    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf an iOS device is stolen it is possible to use Find My iPhone/iPad to help recover it. The problem is that it is simple for the thief to switch off the device, rendering the service incapable of locating it. It would be great if it were possible as part of Find My iPhone or Restrictions to disable powering off the device without first entering a PIN, so that the service can continue to operate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEnable Find My iPhone on an iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Attempt to turn off the iPhone.\r\n2. Be prompted for a PIN.\r\n3. Leave the iPhone on.\r\n4. Attempt to locate it using Find My iPhone.\r\n5. Observe success.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Turn off the iPhone.\r\n2. Attempt to locate it using Find My iPhone.\r\n3. Observe failure.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone."
