    description: If a podcast episode is streamed using the Podcasts app, the app marks the episode as played. When the episode is downloaded, it is correctly still noted as being played. However if the app has been downloaded to iTunes on a Mac/PC in the meantime, when the device is synchronised with iTunes the episodes are not marked as played as they should be.
