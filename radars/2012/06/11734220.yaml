    description: "An entitlement allowing access (read/write, read-only) to screenshots captured by the OS would enable an entire class of existing and new apps to provide services on top of system-taken screenshots. My preference for this entitlement would be the ability to access files with the predicate kMDItemIsScreenCapture.\r\n\r\nThe alternative approach I'm trying at the moment is to use a temporary entitlement to get read/write access to the Desktop. This is obviously grants my app more access than it needs to simply process screenshots and if a user were to have modified system defaults these screenshots could be saved in another location altogether, rendering even that amount of access insufficient."
