    description: "Summary: Even with the \"When I quit Messages, set my status to Offline\" box checked in Messages Beta's preferences, the user still appears online when Messages Beta is closed, so when other users send them an IM, Messages starts up and receives the IM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Messages Beta (with an IM account set up), set status to Available (or any non-offline status), check the \"When I quit Messages, set my status to Offline\" box in Messages Beta's preferences, quit Messages.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: the user shouldn't appear to be online (and so other users shouldn't be able to send them an IM)\r\n\r\nActual Results: the user appears to be online, so other users can send the user an IM, which means the user's copy of Messages Beta opens up and receives the IM.\r\n\r\nRegression: problem occurs on an iMac12,2 and MacBook5,1, both running OS X 10.7.4 with Messages Beta installed.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
