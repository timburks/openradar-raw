    description: "29-Jun-2012 11:57 AM Felipe Kellermann:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe iTunes file sharing feature copies the content in a non-atomic way and there is no API currently in the iOS to detect if iTunes is still copying the content or the content is already complete. This makes the feature of copying content a unsafe and affects the user experience (that normally is required to take some action in the application to \"read\" the content).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app that supports iTunes file sharing feature.\r\n2. Copy a large content (for instance, a 1GB file).\r\n3. The app sees the file but there's no way to check if the copy (sync) already finished.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA method to check whether the copy (sync) already finished or not. Or even better: make the copy (sync) be an atomic operation using a temporary name and a move (atomic). For instance, user copying (syncing) fuu.bar would be fuu.bar.copying and then fuu.bar (atomically).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo atomic copy (sync), no way to check whether the copy (sync) finished or not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
