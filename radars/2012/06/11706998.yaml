    description: "Summary:\r\nOr \"This device is no longer connected.\". Those MODAL popups in Xcode are useless. They should be a better way (non modal) to notify the user the iPhone disconnected. Most of the times, I don't want to be notified. I know I disconnected the iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Xcode. If not yet done, plug iPhone or iPad. Unplug it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA non modal notification (why not just use a Notification in Mountain Lion!)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA Modal popup, very annoying. Actual two most of the times!"
