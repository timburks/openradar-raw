    description: "Summary:\r\nDue to a lot of reasons, “Go Daddy” has -- rightfully! -- been evicted from the list of trusted root-certificate in a security update. Unfortunately, it so happens to be the case that my hotel’s captive network (\"OneView Internet™” provided through Guest-Tek Ltd.) uses a certificate that is issued by Go Daddy.\r\nThis leads to an incompletely loaded splash page because all resources that are being delivered using https with the “Go Daddy” issued certificate fail without an error message.\r\nIn this particular case, all imagery lives on the https while (amusingly) the terms and conditions do not appear to do so.\r\n\r\nSince the form-action for the confirmation button to the terms and conditions on that page also directs to an https resource with the “Go Daddy” certificate, hitting that button results in nothing.\r\nTrying to load any page in Safari will be redirected to the captive network’s splash page, which renders consistent with the behavior described above.\r\nHitting the confirmation button, however, will now trigger the sheet Safari shows for https sites with untrusted certificates, so that one can continue the process by temporarily accepting the certificate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drive up to [HOTEL_ADDRESS] — or setup a captive network that has its splash delivered through http and its sign-on action delivered through https with an untrusted root-certificate.\r\n2. With a Mac running OS X 10.7.4, enter the Mel’s diner and connect to the “HotelOpal” wifi — or try to connect to the network you have created in the latter version of step 1.\r\n3. Hit the “I Accept” button (or whatever triggers the https-served sign-on resource in your own setup) in the window that popped up for joining the captive network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome kind of feedback. Perhaps a more drastic form of the Safari sheet that appears on untrusted https sites.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n**Crickets**\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWhile this happens on OS X 10.7.4, it does _not_ happen on iOS 5.1 (9B176)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou’ll find the logs from Console.app for that process attached."
