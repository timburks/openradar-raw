    description: "Summary:\r\nOn 10.7 and below /dev/diskXXX entries for external devices were owned by the user, allowing apps to read from them with user permissions. Now on 10.8 they are root, which breaks a lot of apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to open one of the /dev/diskXXX devices with normal user permissions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould be readable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIsn't readable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is new to 10.8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nExisting apps on the App Store using this functionality with suddenly break with 10.8.\r\n\r\nThe obvious workaround here is to authenticate the user, but for some reason that's not allowed on App Store apps."
