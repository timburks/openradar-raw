    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n[CLGeocoder reverseGeocodeLocation:completionHandler:] returns very different placemark results on iOS5.0 to 5.1.1 and iOS 6.0, for certain locations. One lat/lng pair in particular is latitude:1.299246 longitude:103.838748. Increasing the CLLocationManagerDelegate desiredAccuracy does not affect the result. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCall reverseGeocodeLocation:completionHandler: with latitude:1.299246 longitude:103.838748 on an iOS 5.0 to 5.1.1 device and iOS6 device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nReturn 31 Exeter Road for both iOS5.0 to 5.1.1 and iOS6\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOn iOS5.0 to 5.1.1, the placemark returned is 3 Fusionopolis Way, 3 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 238633 @ <+1.29914600,+103.83846300> most of the time, which is more than 5 km away. On iOS6.0, the placemark returned is 31A/B Exeter Road, 31A/B Exeter Road, Singapore 23 @ <+1.29942880,+103.83876850>. Google API returns 31 Exeter Road.  \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nFrom iOS5.0 onwards\r\n\r\nNotes:"
