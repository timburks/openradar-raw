    description: "Summary:\r\nNSOperation doesn't nil its completion block after firing it, leading to a cycle if the op is referenced in it's own completion block. If it did nil the completion block then cycles from referencing the op in its own completion block would be avoided.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReference an op in its own completion block and note that it's a cycle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompletion block to be niled after firing, breaking the cycle\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCycle\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample app: http://cl.ly/2u0h1Y1L3e1F"
