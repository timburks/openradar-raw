    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nToday when I asked Siri to \"Create an alarm for 2:20 AM to upgrade my flight\" she misunderstood me and thought that the alarm title was supposed to be called \"2:20 AM to upgrade my flight\" and didn't know what time the alarm was supposed to be set to. Siri ignored the \"2:20 AM\" \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTell Siri to \"Create an alarm for TIME to ACTION\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect Siri to create an alarm for TIME with the label of ACTION.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSiri creates an alarm for \"TIME to ACTION\" and requests a TIME for the alarm. \r\n\r\nSee screenshot:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/1Y2J162t122Y\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIf you tell Siri to \"Create an alarm for TIME that says ACTION\" it works, but it should be able to detect \"to\" or \"that says\" and other combinations of phrasing to work out where the time was in the phrase spoken to it. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nJust want to make Siri better, found this issue particularly annoying as she never seems to get it right."
