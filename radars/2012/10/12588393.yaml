    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's not possible to detect when a file copied to an app through iTunes is completely transferred rather than partially. To achieve this, please make the device coordinate its writes using the NSFileCoordinator/NSFilePresenter API.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached xfer xcode project\r\n2. Launch the app on a device (not simulator). This app is using NSFileCoordinator/Presenter to watch the Documents folder.\r\n3. Use iTunes to transfer a file to the xfer app\r\n3a. select the device in the iTunes Source List\r\n3b. Select Apps Tab\r\n3c. Go to the File Sharing section and select this app (xfer)\r\n3d. Press the \"Addâ€¦\" button to add any file\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter Step 3d, the xfer.app would spit out a log indicating that it saw the file appear via the NSFilePresenter registered with the NSFileCoordinators\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo log console output appear during Step 3d.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAppears to be a duplicate of rdar://11414352 and possibly rdar://10247965\r\n(Source: http://openradar.appspot.com/11414352 )\r\n\r\n\r\nClosed as Duplicate of 10247965"
