    description: "10-Oct-2012 05:48 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: The LED flash on the back of the iPhone is designed for use in shooting photos and video, but it is very useful as a flashlight. However, one can only use it as a flashlight by unlocking the device and opening a third-party app, which is a cumbersome operation when someone just wants some light in a dark place. It would be awesome if the iPhone lock screen had a control to turn the flashlight on and off without need to unlock the device, similar to the existing lock-screen camera control.\r\n\r\nThere should also be a built-in app to control the flashlight, so that any iOS user can control the flashlight without need for a third-party app. There should be settings for automatic shutoff to prevent unexpected battery usage.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: User can turn on LED flashlight without unlocking the device\r\n\r\nActual Results: User has to go through many steps to turn on flashlight.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
