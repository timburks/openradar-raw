    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHeavy CPU usage starts the first time I build&run on device or on simulator.\r\nHeavy CPU usage continues until I exit Xcode.\r\n\r\nIf I stop running the app does not affect CPU usage.\r\n \r\nCPU usage remain high no matter what I do.\r\n \r\nI only have 1 project open at a time. It doesn't matter what project I work on.\r\n\r\nThere is no heavy NSLog output going on.\r\n\r\nI also experienced this with Xcode 4.5.0.\r\n \r\nThere was no problems with Xcode 4.5 DP1 nor Xcode 4.4 nor earlier versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart any Xcode project up.\r\nHit CMD+R.\r\nApprox 10 seconds after compile is done Xcode starts using max cpu on all cores.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLow cpu usage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMax cpu usage and fan spinning at max speed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt may be related to these issues\r\nhttp://openradar.appspot.com/11986168\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4149298?start=0&tstart=0\r\nExcept I have little NSLog output."
