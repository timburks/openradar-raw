    description: "08-Oct-2012 01:49 PM Mahyar McDonald:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe UIImagePickerController Camera UI Freezes when it encounters an error trying to play the 'snap' sound when it takes a picture.   The freeze occurs when a 'kAudioUnitErr_FailedInitialization'  (error -10875) occurs in Apple's code.  Instead of gracefully handling this audio playback error and continuing as usual, the camera UI hangs and does not respond to user touches.  It stays stuck in the aperture closed visual (see attached screenshot).  The rest of the app works properly and is not frozen at this time.  When the audio error occurs, it usually does not play the sound at all, or is corrupted when it plays this sound.   Backgrounding the app and foregrounding it during this error states causes it to recover and play the snap sound after foregrounding.\r\n\r\nThis log is printed when it happens:\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleH4CamIn::setPowerStateGated: 0\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleH4CamIn::power_off_hardware\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleH4CamIn::setPowerStateGated: 1\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleH4CamIn::power_on_hardware\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleH4CamIn::ISP_SelectBestMIPIFrequencyIndex_gated - channel: 1, index: 0\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton mediaserverd[37] <Error>: 15:11:51.876 <CAListenerProxy> AURemoteIO::ChangeHardwareFormats: error -10875\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleH4CamIn::setPowerStateGated: 0\r\nOct  4 15:11:51 Louis-Vuitton kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleH4CamIn::power_off_hardware\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Inside the 'Tango Video Call' app inside a conversation with a user:\r\n\r\n1. Record and send a video message to a user\r\n2. After the video message is sent, tap the \"+\" and select 'Take Photo'\r\n3. Press the camera button to take a picture\r\n4. Press Retake\r\n5. Press the camera button to take another picture\r\n\r\nRESULT: Repeat steps 4 & 5 and Tango will eventually freeze and become stuck. (like shown in screenshot)\r\n\r\nEXPECTED: Tango should not freeze."
