    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen showing a UITextField inside a popover that is opened from an InputAccessoryView, text cannot be entered inside the UITextField anymore in iOS 6 SDK, although this worked when linking against the iOS 5.1 SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project (which is in part derived from Apple's sample project \"KeyboardAccessory\").\r\n2. Start the app in the iPad 6.0 simulator.\r\n3. Tap the \"Tap Me\" button in the input accessory view (the red row above the keyboard). A popover with a table view will show up.\r\n4. Tap inside the first (and only) table view cell to begin editing. The insertion point from the large text view in the back will vanish.\r\n5. Type a letter, an emoji or remove the existing character \"*\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLetters and emojis can be entered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLetters can not be entered. However, emojis can be entered and existing characters can be removed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works just fine when linking against the iOS 5.1 SDK, but not when linking against the iOS 6 SDK.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
