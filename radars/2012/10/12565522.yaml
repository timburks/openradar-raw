    description: "Summary: When a smart playlist's contents become empty, playback doesn't stop\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sync over a smart playlist with (at least) 43 tracks as follows, with a rule requiring a play count of 0\r\n2. Shuffle the playlist\r\n3. Listen to the playlist through to the last track (should probably work if you skip tracks in the middle by scrubbing to the end, so their play counts get incremented)\r\n4. Let the last song (e.g. 43 of 43) finish playing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayback stops, and the Music app navigates to the playlist you played, which now has 0 tracks\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayback continues to a seemingly arbitrary track (was 12 of 43 for me the last time), as if no tracks were removed from the list and you tapped on the 12th track\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis never happened on iOS 4 or 5 or prior on an iPhone 4 or 1st-gen iPhone running iPhone OS 1-3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
