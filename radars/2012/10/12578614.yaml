    description: "Summary:\r\nMacros aren't recognized by the debugger, and some macros don't look like macros until you look for them in the framework headers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(lldb) p (void*)dispatch_get_main_queue()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n(void *const) $1 = 0x04a02bc4\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'dispatch_get_main_queue'\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be super handy if the debugger were made aware of macros someday, but in the meantime I'd settle for tokens that *look* like symbols actually being symbols in the debugger."
