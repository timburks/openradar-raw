    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd love to be able to mark mails as read or to delete them right in Notification Center (or in the banner that appears), instead of having to switch to the Mail application to do so.\r\nEspecially when filtering incoming mail into many different subfolders, it's much easier to do this in one place instead of having to hunt through many folders â€¦"
