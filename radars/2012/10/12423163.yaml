    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening a Finder window from the Terminal, if the folder is already open in another space, the \"open\" command will cause the Finder to become active, but the window isn't visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create multiple Spaces.\r\n2. In one space, open a Finder window, e.g. the the home directory.\r\n3. Switch to another space.\r\n4. Open a terminal session, then open the directory above, e.g. \"open ~\".\r\n5. The Finder will become active, but to the user nothing has happened.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can see one of two outcomes:\r\n1. The Finder becomes active and a new window opens of the directory requested.\r\n2. The screen switches to the space where the Finder window it already open, and it is made front and active.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Finder becomes active and it appears that nothing has happened.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nEarlier versions of the OS would open the Finder window.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is frustrating as to get to the window, I have to manually look for it across several spaces. Worse, when I switch to each space looking for it, I have to make the Finder active before I can look for it (if there are windows from other apps in front as is usually the case). To open the window on the screen I want, it's easier to close it wherever I happen to find it, switch back to the space where I was working, then \"open dir\" again.\r\n\r\nThe Finder of course supports several windows open to the same folder, so there's no reason that this behavior would be unexpected.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is also broken for other apps. For example, if I\r\n1. open a window in Safari\r\n2. switch to another space\r\n3. select the widow from the Safari->Window menu. Nothing happens, forcing me to manually look for where that window is. As the user I've explicitly requested the resource and the computer knows where it is - I shouldn't have to look for it myself."
