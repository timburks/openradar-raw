    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen searching on the App Store on iPad for an application that is only for iPhone, pressing the \"iPhone Apps\" button on the segmented control refreshes that screen, but it still displays the list of iPad applications, not the iPhone ones.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOn iOS 5 iPad or other iOS 6 devices\r\n1. Open App Store and search for \"CricHQ\"\r\n(if on iPad) 2. Once the iPad app list has loaded, tap \"iPhone Apps\"\r\n3. Observe that the application _is_ on that list.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 6 iPad\r\n1. Open App Store and search for \"CricHQ\"\r\n2. Once the iPad app list has loaded, tap \"iPhone Apps\"\r\n3. Observe that the application _is not_ on that list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat pressing the button to display iPhone apps will display the list of iPhone apps\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPressing that button refreshes the display but still only the list of iPad apps"
