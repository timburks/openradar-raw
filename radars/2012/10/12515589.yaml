    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I setup an audio session, then create an AVPlayer I do not get an audio interruption begin callback. If I don't create the AVPlayer everything works as expected. It seems like AVPlayer is manipulating my audio session or stealing away my callback, is there a way to prevent this?\r\n\r\nI have tried releasing the AVPlayer or reasserting my audio session but nothing seems to help.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the provided app, you will hear the AVPlayer play, cause an interruption (double tap home, swipe right, play some music), notice no TTY output even though I have an interrupt callback registered. Now comment out the AVPlayer init and repeat the above, notice you do get TTY output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApplication should receive interruption notification.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo interrupt notification if AVPlayer is used.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks as expected on iOS 5."
