    description: "04-Oct-2012 01:41 AM Felipe Kellermann:\r\nSummary:\r\nAs is expected by all Objective-C developers, when a class \"conforms\" to a given protocol with some @required methods, the Xcode/LLVM should warn when there are any missing @required methods, providing a fundamental information to all developers that are using the iOS SDKs and other external SDKs.\r\n\r\nThe new Apple's \"Programming with Objective-C\" book explicitly indicates that \"Once youâ€™ve indicated conformance to a protocol, the class must at least provide method implementations for each of the required protocol methods, as well as any optional methods you choose. The compiler will warn you if you fail to implement any of the required methods\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a simple project using 4.5 (or 4.5.1) and \"conforms\" to any protocol that contains @required methods, like the good old UITableViewDataSource, which contains two stub methods (please don't add the \"conform\" to a subclass of UITableViewController VC, do it using a standard one).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWarning provided by LLVM and informed via Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo Issues at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n4.4 worked fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is quite confusing especially for people trying to understand the conecepts of Objective-C and Cocoa programming. Even for advanced users, the issues/warnings for missing @required methods are always nice to keep things safe."
