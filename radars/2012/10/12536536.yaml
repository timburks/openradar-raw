    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be really, really nice to be able to know not only how the user dismissed the SLComposeViewController view (e.g., posted or cancelled), but also the ultimate result of the action.  I know that a UIAlertView will be displayed in case of (at least one type of) failure (as I got a \"Cannot Post To Facebook\" alert yesterday when there were posting problems), but to be able to know that from a programmatic point of view would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nI would use such a result status to, say, display a checkmark beside items in my app that the user has already successfully shared, or to give a quick \"Your item was shared!\" display in the UI."
