    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery time I try to go to the \"Purchased\" section of the iOS App Store app on iOS 6, it crashes with a memory ejection after several seconds, but before displaying any apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open App Store\r\n2) Tap \"Updates\"\r\n3) Tap \"Purchased\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA list of apps I've purchased should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Purchased\" controller gets pushed onto the stack, a \"Loadingâ€¦\" indicator displays for a while, then the app crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt occurs every single time, despite reboots, tweaking settings in Settings->Privacy->Location Services->System Services, as recommended by various people on Apple discussion boards.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm running iOS 6.0(10A403) on an iPhone 4S 64GB. One thing to note is that I buy a lot of apps. There are currently 1,241 apps in my iTunes library."
