    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a full-screen app with a dual-screen display, one screen is virtually useless. It would be nice to have the option to open a second full-screen app in the other display. More specifically, for an N-screen display, it should allow N full-screen apps open.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn a dual-screen Mac setup, open any app in full-screen mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ability to open a second app in the other screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne screen becomes grey and useless."
