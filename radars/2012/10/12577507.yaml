    description: "25-Oct-2012 05:16 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe latest version of iBooks is jettisoned shortly after opening and before any files are listed on the 1st generation iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet a 1st generation iPad. Put a large PDF document on it using iTunes. For example, mine is just shy of 500MB.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect iBooks to display all my books and PDFs normally, and to open the large PDF if I so choose in a memory efficient manner that doesn't cause the app to be jettisoned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWith at least one large PDF in the collection, then iBooks will be jettisoned shortly after opening and is completely unusable. There is no way to switch between books and PDF collections, and no assets are listed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not a problem on the last version of iBooks which handled the exact same PDF without crashing. It was very very slow, but it opened and once opened was usable. iBooks 3 on the other hand doesn't even list the book before it's jettisoned.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I delete the PDF, then iBooks will open as expected. The PDF is not malformed because the old version read the same PDF file without trouble [albeit it took a long time to load].\r\n\r\n\r\n25-Oct-2012 05:17 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nThe iPad was restarted gracefully in between attempts to get this working."
