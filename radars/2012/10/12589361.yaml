    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAt present, only system fonts can be chosen for a UILabel in Interface Builder. When building a very custom user interface that uses additional fonts included in the app bundle, this makes it harder to position the label accurately, as it is impossible to preview what its text will look like with the final font.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEdit a xib file in Interface Builder.\r\nAdd a UILabel to the view.\r\nOpen the Attributes inspector.\r\nClick on the \"T\" icon under \"Font\".\r\nSelect \"Custom\" for the \"Font\" option.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe popup dialog should allow the user to input the name of the custom font.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no such option. Only fonts included with the system are displayed."
