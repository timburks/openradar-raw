    description: "My Mac is connected via Ethernet and a NAT router to the Internet.\r\n\r\nI've configured Internet Sharing on the Mac to share my Ethernet connection via Wifi (using WEP128, but tried unencrypted, too).\r\n\r\nAll iOS devices I tested (iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPhone 4 running 6.0, iPad 2 running 5.1.1) could not connect to the Internet.\r\n\r\nThey could connect to the Wifi, they got an IP (192.168.2.2) and a router (192.168.2.1) assigned via DHCP. The Mac could ping them and the iPhone could access services in the local network via IP address. No DNS was assigned.\r\n\r\nHowever, the iPhone can't access any Internet service (e.g. Maps).\r\n\r\n\r\nI manually specified a DNS on the iPhone and now the connection works perfectly. It seems that Internet Sharing's DHCP server doesn't correctly assign the DNS to its clients."
