    description: "09-Oct-2012 12:45 PM David Jarrett:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen running an iPad application in landscape orientation with a UITextField as the first responder, and a keyboard is present; when a UIButton is pressed in order to present a UIViewController with a presentation style of UIModalPresentationFormSheet and a transition style of UIModalTransitionStyleCrossDissolve, the presented view controller appears off screen. If this view controller additionally contains further UITextFields, then by tapping on these, they are made first responder and the presented View Controller can be brought back on screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Setup an application with a UITextField and a UIButton, with the UIButton set to present a modal view controller in the above specification.\r\n2. Load the application up on an iPad and ensure the orientation is landscape.\r\n3. Tap on the UITextField in order to make it first responder and bring up the keyboard.\r\n4. Tap on the UIButton. The presented View Controller will appear off screen, to the top-left of the presenting view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe View Controller should appear in the center of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe View Controller appears off screen to the top-left of the presenting view controller, with the bottom-right portion of the presented view controller appearing in the top-left portion of the presenting view controller (see image attached).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSeems to be present since Product Version 3.2 (http://www.openradar.me/8425603)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSample app and screenshot included. This can be worked around by sending resignFirstResponder to the firstResponder before dismissing the modal view.\r\n\r\nSample App / Screenshot: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16311777/UIModalBug.zip"
