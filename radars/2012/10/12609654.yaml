    description: "31-Oct-2012 03:12 PM Ben Englert:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCertain paths for adding contacts on the iPhone result in the contact being stored locally on the phone even though the phone is configured to store all contacts in iCloud.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConfigure an iPhone and another device (iPhone/Pad/Mac) to share contacts over iCloud. Open a VCF attached to an email message on the iPhone, and use \"Create New Contact\". Open \"Phone\" app and verify that the new contact has appeared in the Contacts tab.\r\n\r\nTurn off iCloud Contacts in Settings on the iPhone, and choose \"Delete from my iPhone\" when prompted.\r\n\r\nOpen Contacts on another device associated with the iCloud account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1) New contact should disappear from the Contacts tab of the Phone app, given that contacts were supposedly deleted when iCloud was disabled.\r\n\r\n2) The contact information imported from the VCF should be visible from Contacts on all devices associated with the iCloud account.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1) New contact persists after disabling iCloud contacts, as though it is located locally on the phone and not considered an iCloud contact.\r\n\r\n2) New contact does not sync to other devices.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNo other accounts (Exchange, Gmail, etc) are configured on the iPhone in question - iCloud should be the only destination for contact info. \r\n\r\nWhether a contact gets synced to iCloud when created from my iPhone seems to vary per application - contacts created by Phone, Messages, and third-party apps (Google Voice) don't appear to sync, whereas contacts created in the Contacts app on the iPhone do sync. VCF import through Mail was the easiest to reproduce so it is the example I chose."
