    description: "Summary: When you use the setThumbTintColor for a UISwitch, it makes the app crash always when the view that contains the switch is rendered for the second time. Works well the first time it is rendered, after that always crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a sample application.\r\n\r\n2. Add a navigation stack to the app.\r\n\r\n3. The root view controller can be anything.\r\n\r\n4. The next view controller must contain a UISwitch that has the setThumbTintColor property set to some RGB.\r\n\r\n5. Navigate from root to the view controller containing the switch.\r\n\r\n6. Go back.\r\n\r\n7. Try navigating again to the view with the switch.\r\n\r\n8. Crash.\r\n\r\n9. Comment out the setThumbTintColor part. Repeat. Works flawlessly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo crashes. Flawless working.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrashes each time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n -\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHappens when the view controller that contains the switch has NOT been @property @synthesized in the app delegate. Works without crash if it has been done so. Maybe it's getting released early? But happens only with the thumbcolor tint customization with a UISwitch. Works fine for all other elements like UISlider etc."
