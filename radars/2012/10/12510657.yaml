    description: "When developing iPhone 5-specific applications, or trying to con your previous iOS apps to run on the iPhone 5, there is a huge misunderstanding on how to make iOS apps run on the 4\" Retina Display. While AutoLayout is great, it cannot do some things like resizing elements or move them around to fit the bigger screen. This is an issue that has already been solved with the use of more than one Storyboard in Xcode. This is truly a trivial task when developing Universal apps for iPad and iPhone, because more than one Storyboard is used for the screen size. \r\n\r\nWhat I would like to propose is using a separate Storyboard in Xcode for the different types of screens. It could be optional, but I'm sure I'm not the only developer that would like to see the ability to use a separate Storyboard for iPhone 3.5\", iPhone 4\", and iPad.\r\n\r\nPlease consider implementing this in a future version of Xcode. It would definitely solve a lot of my headaches, and the headaches of other developers."
