        UIImageView should have a property for padding. This should be settable in Interface Builder, and should take UIEdgeInsets (i.e. be specifiable for each side of the image).

        My current use case is UITableView cells: I am having to write a custom cell, since I need padding around the thumbnail image. If UIImageView had a padding option, I could use the standard cell.

        The padding will represent empty space to be left between the edge of the view and the start of the image. If the view had a background colour, that will be drawn in the padded area (since it's still part of the view), enabling easy effects like a white surround for a thumbnail image.

        Padding should be treated as a minimum. If the view has a content mode that causes aspect ratio aware scaling, then it's possible there will be more padding than was requested, but there should never be less.
