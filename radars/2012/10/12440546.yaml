    description: "Summary: It would be great to have some way of knowing whether there are any notifications waiting for the user in Notification Center. In one of the beta releases of OS X Mountain Lion, the Notification Center status-bar item would glow blue when there were new notifications in Notification Center (this feature was removed by the time Mountain Lion was released). Something similar to that on iOS would be useful â€” right now, users have to remember to open Notification Center to see if there are any new notifications, which means users don't always know that there are notifications waiting for them, so notifications pile up. An indicator in the status bar (just a white dot, a monochrome version of the \"unread\" dot) would be enough to let users know that they have notifications in Notification Center.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: iOS 5.0+\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
