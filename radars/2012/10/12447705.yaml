    description: "Summary: Messages often discards days worth of history, from as recently as one screenful-ago\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: All day long, I leave Messages running on my 10.8.2 computer at home, logged into my company's Jabber server. It records every IM that comes across the several chat rooms that I care about and wish to archive. I come home, scroll up in Messages, and more often than not, discover that a screenful or two or three above the most recent IM, Messages has thrown away hours or days of valuable traffic, and stitched in some of this room's message traffic from days prior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I expect Messages to keep every message it receives, allowing me to scroll through them in chronological order, with zero risk of data loss in doing so. \r\n\r\nActual Results: Messages frequently loses thousands of messages.\r\n\r\nRegression: This bug is new in Messages. It was not present in iChat."
