    description: "I have a view that I want to be centered vertically and horizontally.\r\n\r\nIn IB for a Mac app, I drag a view to the center of its superview and an 'Align Center to Superview' constraint is created for both X and Y axis.\r\n\r\nIn IB for an iOS app, the same action only creates the 'Align Center to Superview' constraint for the X axis.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I have a view that should remain centered vertically regardless of whether on a 3.5\" or 4\" iPhone screen.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no way in IB to set a constraint to center the view vertically within its superview.\r\n\r\nThat seems like it should be possible."
