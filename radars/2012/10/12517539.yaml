        In a xib (Mac), renaming a top level object doesn't update the GUI. It does persist the change, but it seems like it doesn't.

        Steps to reproduce:
        1. Open a xib
        2. Drag an NSArrayController into the objects section
        3. Click on the name to rename it, and enter a new name
        4. Hit return.

        Expected result:
        The name changes.

        Actual result:
        The name reverts in the GUI to "Array Controller". However, the new name is saved to disk, and will appear if the file is closed then reopened.
