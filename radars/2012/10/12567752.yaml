    description: "24-Oct-2012 04:31 PM Heath Borders:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf I #import a script with UIAutomation, I expect to be able to use variables that script exposes immediately after #import returns. If I have transitive dependencies, they load out of order.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse 3 scripts:\r\n\r\nTest imports A.js\r\nA.js imports B.js and calls function C.\r\nB.js declares function C.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe js files are loaded in the following order:\r\nTest.js (since it triggered the script, it should ultimately go first, but should block until all imports are resolved)\r\nB.js\r\nA.js\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe js files are loaded in the following order:\r\nTest.js\r\nA.js\r\nB.js\r\n\r\nThis means that I can't use anything declared in B.js in A.js even though A.js imports B.js\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can workaround this problem by importing all my files in a single js file instead of just importing what I need in my test.\r\n\r\n\r\n24-Oct-2012 04:31 PM Heath Borders:\r\n'UIAutomationIncludeBug.zip' was successfully uploaded"
