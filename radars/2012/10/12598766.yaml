        When making Mac apps, if using layer backed views, one can set layer properties such as shadow in Interface Builder. This option is lacking when developing for iOS.

        Layer shadow is the specific thing I was trying to do at the moment. Border and corner radius would also be great properties to expose in the Interface Builder GUI.
