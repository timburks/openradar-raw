    description: "16-Oct-2012 12:14 AM Caleb Jaffa:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the Newsstand icon is set for an issue, the image is saved in the root of the app folder as NewsstandArtwork. This file is not set to be excluded from iCloud backups which can cause app submissions to be rejected due to iCloud usage. The newsstand artwork would fall under things that do not need to be backed up to iCloud anyway.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the newsstand artwork for an issue, particularly with a high-res image and see that the iCloud usage for an app's backup grow to at least contain that size.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the NewsstandArtwork file would be excluded from iCloud backup.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I would expect per table 8-2 at http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/IconsImages/IconsImages.html that the NewsstandArtwork file would either be scaled to the maximum size in that table thus keeping the app's iCloud usage low so reviewers don't reject apps for using the SDK properly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCloud usage is too high, above 2mb seems to be the magic number, and all the user did was download data that was excluded from iCloud and nothing else.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not happen before iOS 6 SDK, at least we never had apps rejected for this before. Does not seem to trigger rejection if the Newsstand Artwork file is smaller than about 2mb.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI take this as a serious bug since I'm not sure if we can even touch that file to exclude it from iCloud backup is in the root of the app folder at the same level as Library. Though I will certainly try tomorrow, but this seems to fall under something Apple should own."
