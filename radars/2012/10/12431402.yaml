    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen swapping an existing navigation bar button item with another bar button item, VoiceOver fails to register this change. Flicking left/right in an attempt to select the navigation bar button item with VoiceOver usually results in the older bar button item (that had already been swapped out) being 'selected', instead of the current bar button item that is in the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload sample project. Watch video: http://d.pr/v/O5fE\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver updates itself with the changes to bar button items.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceOver continues to select the bar button item that is no longer in sight.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nVoiceOver is able to recognise the new bar button item when it is tapped upon directly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHappens whether or not the change to bar button item was animated or not. Posting a UIAccessibilityScreenChangedNotification does not help either.\r\n\r\nAttachment:\r\n'VoiceOverNavigationBarButtonBug.zip' sample project: http://d.pr/f/qoxM"
