    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have a subclass of CALayer that implements drawInContext: and also has borderWidth, borderColor. It works fine.\r\n\r\nIf I set the zPosition of the layer to be above about 1e38 it all works fine on my iMac, but on my MBP and MBA it only draws the border, no contents (drawInContext: is called, but no contents display).\r\n\r\nIn fact on my iMac it works up to and include CGFLOAT_MAX (my idea was a layer that would be guaranteed to be at the top).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSet a CALayer zPosition to be CGFLOAT_MAX.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe layer draws.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe layer draws only on some Macs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is presumably a limitation of video hardware and as such should really be documented in the CALayer docs."
