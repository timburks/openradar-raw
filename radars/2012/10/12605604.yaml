    description: "Summary:\r\nInstalling the PersistentConnectionLogging mobile configuration to debug push notifications does not create relevant log files.\r\nI am running an iPod Touch 4th gen, with a normal release of iOS 6.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Follow steps described in tech note 2265 under \"Observing Push Status Messages\" to enable logging for iOS: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2265/_index.html\r\n(in summary, install the PersistentConnectionLogging.mobileconfig, reboot the device, exercise app, watch logs)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLog lines from an \"apsd\" process.\r\nA PersistentConnection log (or multiple) should have been created and logged to.\r\nThe documentation is not specific, but it appears that this should create a folder and multiple log files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo logs of any kind by \"apsd\" process, no PersistentConnection logs, and multiple warning-level logs which state that the log could not be created (repeated multiple times in a row each) of three different kinds (that I have noticed).  The complete log after a reboot is attached, but example lines are:\r\n1) Oct 30 19:40:14 [removed device name] passd[194] <Warning>: Unable to open logging file '/var/mobile/Library/Logs/PersistentConnection/com.apple.passd-passd-APSClient.log'\r\n2) Oct 30 19:31:51 [removed device name] syncdefaultsd[183] <Warning>: Unable to open logging file '/var/mobile/Library/Logs/PersistentConnection/com.apple.syncdefaultsd-syncdefaultsd-APSClient.log'\r\n3) Oct 30 19:31:50 [removed device name] SpringBoard[65] <Warning>: Unable to open logging file '/var/mobile/Library/Logs/PersistentConnection/com.apple.springboard-SpringBoard-APSClient.log'"
