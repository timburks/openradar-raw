    description: "Typically when the Command + Delete keys are pressed in a textfield, the entire line is deleted. In Messages, this keyboard command doesn't delete the line of text, but rather prompts the user if they wish to delete the selected conversation. This type of Command + Delete function is customary when using Finder if one were to select an icon and choose to delete it, Command + Delete will move the object to the trash. However, when the focus is within a textfield, the behavior should follow the former command of deleting the line of text.\r\n\r\nDeleting the entire conversation with no ability to undo can be devastating under certain circumstances for some users. This should be changed."
