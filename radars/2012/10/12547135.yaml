        Summary:
        OS X uses a so called “dirt indicator” to mark edited documents with unsaved changes. (dirty documents). This is shown by a dot in the close-window-widget in OS X document windows. Keynote 5.2 does not show this indicator on documents with unsaved changes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a new document in Keynote. Save it to a local file. Make another change.

        Expected Results:
        Upon the first change after saving the dirt indicator should appear in the close-window-widget.

        Actual Results:
        The dirt indicator is never ever shown.

        Regression:
        This behavior violates the human interface guidelines and is inconsistent with other applications as well as 10+ years of OS X UI history (and a few more on NeXTStep).
