    description: "Summary:\r\nChanging a contact's company field in the Contacts application when there are sections (ie, alphabetical groups in the table view), then changing the focus to something else, causes it to move down to the next section or disappear entirely if it was in the last.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose 'All Contacts' or a group with enough contacts in it to form a sectioned table view.\r\n2. Choose the last contact in any section.\r\n3. Edit the contact.\r\n4. Change the 'company' field to anything.\r\n5. Click e.g. below the 'note' area, causing the 'company' field to lose focus.\r\n6. Note that the contact has moved below the section separator.  If it was the last contact in the last group, it has disappeared from the view.\r\n7. Change groups and go back - contact is in its correct location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanging a non-grouping / sorting field should not affect the contact's position.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanging 'company' changes the contact's position in the list."
