    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to use the same Apple ID for multiple iTunes Connect companies is impossible\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLog in to iTC as the Administrator for a company (Company A).\r\nClick on \"Manage Users\"\r\nClick on \"Add User\"\r\nEnter information for worker bee #1 (John Q Developer - johnq@developer.com)\r\nContinue, and eventually log out of iTC\r\n\r\nLog back into iTC as the Administrator for another company (Company B)\r\nClick on \"Manage Users\"\r\nClick on \"Add User\"\r\nEnter the same information for worker bee #1 (John Q Developer - johnq@developer.com)\r\nReceive an error message:\r\n\"This email address is alrady in use or you may already have an Apple ID associated with this email address. Please try again or sign in using your existing Apple ID.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstead of receiving an error message, I would expect the system to process the request and have johnq@developer.com to be able to access iTC for Company A or Company B\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMostly confused clients, but also a 0:30 - 0:40 temper tantrum every time (tantrum time dependent on number of hours of sleep and cups of coffee).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis behavior is pointed out in the iTC FAQs, but ... c'mon... this limitation is beyond absurd.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm certain this is a dupe. I can't possibly be the only work-for-hire developer to point out how inconvenient this limitation is."
