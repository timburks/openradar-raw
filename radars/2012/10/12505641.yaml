        Summary:
        When you move a commented out line in a file, you can uncomment it

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open a .m or other file in Xcode that obeys C syntax
        Comment out an indented line using ⌘/ (command-slash)
        Note that the // appears at the beginning of the line (not indented)
        Cut the line that you just commented out
        Paste it somewhere else in the file
        Note that the // appears indented
        Try to remove the // from the line by pressing ⌘/ (command-slash)

        Expected Results:
        The comment should be removed

        Actual Results:
        An additional // is added at the beginning of the line. For example, if the line started out as:
            a = 5;
        And you commented it out with ⌘-/ it would become:
        // a = 5
        And then you moved it elsewhere in the file it changes to:
            // a = 5
        And then you try to uncomment it and it becomes:
        //   // a = 5
        Instead of going back to
            a = 5

        Notes:
        As an instructor this drives me batty! I'm often commenting in/out parts of code to demonstrate different things. It seems the root problem is a conflict with auto indent and the comment insertion.
