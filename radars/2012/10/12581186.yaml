    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, iTunes Connect wants higher resolution app icon artwork, which is currently uploaded in PNG format.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Log into iTunes Connect\r\n* Add a new version to an existing app\r\n* Observe iTunes Connect wants higher resolution artwork before the update can be uploaded\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\niTunes Connect should accept a vector graphics format (e.g. SVG) which it can render to bitmap formats at the required resolution.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWe can only upload bitmap images and keep being asked for progressively higher and higher resolutions, which is getting tedious.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
