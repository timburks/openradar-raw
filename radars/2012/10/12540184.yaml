    description: "When you create a file for a new view controller subclass, there in an option to also create a xib file.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no similar convenience if using a storyboard file.  It would be very useful to be able to automatically insert a scene into the storyboard with the view controller subclass already set, etc.\r\n\r\nSince there could be multiple storyboards, it may need to be similar to choosing which target new files belong to.\r\n\r\nAlternately, perhaps dragging a view controller header to a storyboard could create a scene based on that view controller class.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it would be great if this convenience that exists with xibs was carried over to storyboards."
