    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter submitting an application for review to the Mac App Store, it takes 26 days on average until the application gets approved.  This is almost 4 times as long as it used to take in the beginning of 2012.\r\n(source: http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com)\r\n\r\nOverlong review times cause frustration for users and developers, as bug features and feature enhancements don't arrive in the hand of paying customers as fast as they should.\r\n\r\nAs a small business owner I'm disappointed and angry about the lack of the performance I'm seeing on Apple's side. Considering the premium commission rate of 30% charged, those review times are not acceptable. The commission payments my company alone has made since the arrival of the Mac App Store should be sufficient to hire a permanent reviewer just for our applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- submit a new version of an OS X application to the Mac App Store for review \r\n- wait for almost 4 weeks until bug fixes arrive in the hands of your customers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- review times should be on pair with iOS app store\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- review times are almost 4 times higher than iOS review times\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- earlier this year review times where comparable to iOS App store review times"
