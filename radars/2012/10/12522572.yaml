    description: "Please update the -[UIViewController viewDidLoad] reference to explain that method's role in the view lifecycle. With -viewDidUnload dead, it seems like -viewDidUnload will never be called more than once for a given view controller. If that's true, it would be nice to know. If that's NOT true, we need to know when and why that could happen, especially now that we've lost the parity that -viewDidUnload brought.\r\n\r\nDevs are probably assuming this (that it's now effectively a postponed initializer) right now. We need a formal confirmation/denial of the situation in iOS 6 or later."
