    description: "05-Oct-2012 09:28 AM Neil Gall:\r\nSummary:\r\nSiri used to understand \"when I get home\", \"when I arrive home\" and \"when I leave home\" to set a location-based reminder. This has stopped working. My personal information is correctly set in Siri, and Location Services are enabled. Siri can set reminders based on other locations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ask Siri to set a reminder for when you arrive or leave home.\r\n2. Siri says \"when would you like me to remind you?\"\r\n3. Respond \"when I arrive home\"\r\n4. Siri says \"I can remind you at a specific time or when you leave or arrive somewhere\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should set a location-based reminder for when I arrive or leave home.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to set a location-based reminder for arriving or leaving home.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes, this used to work. Possibly it broke on the update to iOS6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot: http://d.pr/i/TZGq"
