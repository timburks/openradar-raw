    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using autolayout, setting a view transform produces an unexpected rubber banding effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the attached example project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code should work the same with and without autolayout.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCode without autolayout works as expected. Code with layout has a rubberbanding effect.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a, first appeared in iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt’s possible that this is actually the expected behavior. Possibly the view tries to both satisfy its constraints as well as the transform at the same time. However, it is then poorly documented, there’s no material available regarding how autolayout is supposed to work with transforms."
