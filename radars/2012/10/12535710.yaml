    description: AppKit's NSToolbar class moves up and down with the main menu bar show / hide when a window is in full-screen mode. However, the reality is that NSToolbar is quite limited, and many applications (including Xcode and Safari) have tabs and other "top" UI controls that need to be moved as well when the menu bar goes up and down. It would be great if we could have API that allows us to specify which views will be moved up and down with the main menu bar, in addition to (or instead of) any NSToolbars associated with the window. Apple applications including Xcode and Safari already do this with their tabs.
