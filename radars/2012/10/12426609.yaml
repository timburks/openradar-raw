    description: "Summary:\r\nProfile Manager on 10.7+ creates management settings that can only be enforced with the 'always' frequency. Therefore, ByHost and third-party preference manifests that require 'often' or would preferably be enforced with the 'once' frequency cannot be created or distributed\r\n \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Server.app on 10.7 or 10.8, configuring networking and hostnames and the OD and ProfileManager services\r\n2. Log into Profile Manager management interface, and select a device, user or group\r\n3. Under the Profile tab click edit, then Configure any payload, but most importantly click plus to add a plist for Custom Settings\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Option in interface to enforce the 'once' or 'often' frequency setting  \r\nActual Results: No such options are exposed\r\n\r\nRegression: All versions of 10.7 Server's Server.app and 10.8's Server.app 2.x\r\n\r\nNotes: This is actually able to be custom configured, but then cannot be loaded back into Profile Manager, as illustrated here:\r\nhttps://github.com/timsutton/mcxToProfile/blob/master/mcxToProfile.py#L114\r\nThat link is directly to how the 'once' setting can be applied, and just above is what's necessary to use the 'often' setting with a configuration profile generated from any applicable preference plist.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKED AS DUPLICATE OF 11700906"
