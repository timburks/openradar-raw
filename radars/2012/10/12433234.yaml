    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nGoing fullscreen on an MPMoviePlayerController causes the parent's viewDidDisappear:animated and viewWillDisappear:animated to trigger on iOS 6 on the iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) In a view controller, create a MPMoviePlayerController and place it on screen.  \r\n2) Implement viewWillDisappear:animated on the view controller with a NSLog to show evidence of the method firing.  \r\n3) Run the app, make the video go full screen.  \r\n\r\nThe event is triggered.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nView controller should not report that its view has disappeared.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nviewWillDisappear:animated and viewDidDisappear:animated methods are fired when MPMoviePlayerController goes to full screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIn iOS 5 and below, this does not seem to happen.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHave been using a combination of the view disappearance methods and MPMoviePlayerController fullscreen boolean to work around the problem, as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12604825/entering-full-screen-in-mpmovieplayercontroller-calls-viewwilldisappear-and-view\r\n\r\nSubmitted to bugreport.apple.com."
