    description: "Summary:\r\nWe've decided to update our Facebook SDK from 3.0 to 3.1, and had to add optional Accounts.framework and Social.framework. This caused a really hard to catch bug, that seems to be introduced with iOS 6.0 (it may have been present in 5.x, we're not sure). Our project contained 'LanguageCell.h' file, which never got used, since the system's 'LanguageCell.h' file was used. I know this because I found this file here: https://github.com/steipete/iOS6-Runtime-Headers\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI believe that Accounts.framework or Social.framework use the private Preferences.framework, so creating a project that contains these frameworks, along with the user's own LanguageCell.h will cause a class name collision.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user's LanguageCell.h is used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system's LanguageCell.h is used.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease rename this file."
