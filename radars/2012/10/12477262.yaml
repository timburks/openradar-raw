    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe attempts of iOS to detect and present captive portal web pages when logging into a WLAN don't work with some internet access portals (for example Swisscom ADSGgo). This can be extremely annoying, as it completely prevents internet access with iOS devices despite fully functional infrastructure.\r\n\r\nConclusion: This high-level intervention into low-level TCP/WLAN connectivity makes sense as a default, but should have a switch in the network settings details (along with the controls for static IP, proxies etc.) TO COMPLETELY DISABLE iOS TO ATTEMPT TO \"UNDERSTAND\" ANYTHING BEYOND TCP/IP WHILE CONNECTING TO NETWORKS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to connect to the internet on a Swisscom ADSLgo WLAN router (extremely popular pay per use ADSL offer from Swiss national provider Swisscom.com)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nConnection to internet\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNO WAY to get a connection, iOS closes WLAN connection before captive portal can show it's start/stop control panel window.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nHas worked in iOS5 and below.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhile it would also be nice to have better compatibility of iOS6 with various portals like Swisscom's, the KEY POINT is that such intrusive functionality should always have a WAY AROUND. Getting excluded from internet access by \"smart\" cross network layer \"magic\" messing with my connection is highly unnerving."
