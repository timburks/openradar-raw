    description: "02-Oct-2012 05:06 PM Martin HERING:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen AVAudioSession is used and active, an incoming phone call does not send the AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification notification with type AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeBegan as described in the docs. At the end of the phone call however it sends the notification with the type AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeEnded which is correct. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt also does not invoke beginInterruption on the audio sessions delegate anymore, but since the delegate is deprecated anyhow, I don't expect that to be fixed. However it might have something to do with the actual bug."
