    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCorrect United Kingdom addresses are not always parsed correctly. This means they then fail to match unique locations, even then matching completely incorrect locations.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you aren't careful you could end up miles away from where you intended to be.\r\n\r\nThis fault also makes location based Reminders for Home NEVER work for me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch in maps for the correct UK postal address \"8 Green Lane, Lower Kingswood, Tadworth, KT20 6TB, United Kingdom\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe address should uniquely match a single location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nInstead two matches are returned:\r\n\r\n- 8 Green Lane, Redhill, RH1 2DT, England\r\n- 8 Green Lane, Lower Kingswood, KT20 6TB, England\r\n\r\nThe first address is just wrong, that is several miles away from the correct location. The second is the correct location, but it is the incorrect address format. It has omitted the postal town (Tadworth) and it has England rather than United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't know the area (clearly a key use case for mapping) you could very easily pick the first address and end up at completely the wrong location.\r\n\r\nThis also breaks location based Reminders set to Home, as this address is my home address. Reminders appears to just pick the first location returned from an address. So in this case it picks the completely wrong \"8 Green Lane, Redhill, RH1 2DT, England\" as my home address.\r\n\r\nAnd so Reminders set for my home NEVER fire.\r\n\r\nThis issue equally effects Reminders in OSX 10.8.2, that also matches two locations for my home address and automatically picks the first totally wrong location. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from iOS 5, the address parsing in iOS 5 correctly matches a single location for this address.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI tried working round the problem, by changing my address to \"8 Green Lane, Lower Kingswood, KT20 6TB, England\". But if you do that it still returns both matches, though with the correct by wrongly formatted address first in the list.\r\n\r\nI have also various other address formats, but none that I tried returned a single location for this address.\r\n\r\nThe TomTom app has no problem parsing this address..."
