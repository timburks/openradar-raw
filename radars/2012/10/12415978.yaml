    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 4.5 / iOS 6, connecting an action to the first responder has no effect. It is set in the storyboard file, but at runtime, the target/action is not set at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHere's a sample demonstrating the bug. \r\nhttps://github.com/n-b/FirstResponderBugWithStoryboard\r\n\r\nYou can switch a commented line in the appdelegate to use a nib instead of a storyboard.\r\nBoth contain the same viewcontroller (\"TestVC\"), setup with a single button, connection to an action in the app delegate. Tapping the button should trigger the action in the responder chain.\r\n\r\nWhen using the nib, the connection is set, and the action is fired. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWorks with nibs. Probably broken for the first time since Interface Builder 1.0."
