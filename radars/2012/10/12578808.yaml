    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning with a debugger attached (so you can see your NSLogs and do some debugging) at the same time as Instruments (because then you can better visualise information relevant to your debugging session) is not possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nProfile application on device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstruments opens, Xcode attaches to the app, both work in beautiful harmony.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne or the other, and don't even try running one app in instruments and another in the debugger either.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't remember having this problem with Mac apps, so I guess this is a regression sinceâ€¦ 2007?"
