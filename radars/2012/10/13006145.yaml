    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI am able to type something like \"{EVENT} @ 10:20\", but sometimes it will set the date of the reminder to 10:20AM even though that time has passed in the current day. The notification for the reminder goes off and my Mac beeps in my face.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In Reminders.app, create a new item\r\n2. Name the item whatever, and append @ and a time without AM/PM\r\n3. Reminders may set it to a time that has already passed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nReminders should realize that the time for the reminder has to be a future time on the current day and not a time that has already passed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nReminders sets the time to a time that has already passed.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
