    description: "17-Oct-2012 04:37 PM Ross Kimes:\r\nSummary:\r\nI should be able to set apps that can ignore 'No Not Disturb' the same way that I can have people ignore it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings -> Notifications -> Do Not Disturb.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be a section for apps that ignore it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo section.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis would be useful for emergency based apps. For example, I use a weather radio app that sends push notifications for tornado warnings.  If am in bed (and my Do Not Disturb is turned on as normal), I would still want the notification telling me that I am in a Tornado warnings.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
