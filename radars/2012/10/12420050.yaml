        The App store notificaiton that says "Updates available: New software is ready to be installed" has two buttons: "Details" and "Update".

        It is unclear which to press if you want the notification to go away, for example if you are in the middle of work and neither  have time to perform the updates nor read about them.

        Swiping to the right makes the notification go away, but it returns very soon (it seems to be like a snooze function).

        I suggest that the buttons be "Close" and "Details".
