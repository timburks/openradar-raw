    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLRequest caches all responses in iOS 6.0 which is different than how iOS 5 and previous handled the cache. This results in URL calls with distinct headers returning back the same cached results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a URL request object with unique headers (we use a header for passing an authorization token).\r\nExecute the request and inspect the contents.\r\nCreate another URL request with the same URL but different headers (again we use one header to pass in the account authorization token).\r\nExecute request and inspect the contents.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is expected that the second request would return unique results because the request is unique. Even though the URL is the same, the headers are different.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSURLRequest will return the results from the first request to the second request which appears to be from the cache.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks as expected in all previous iOS version before 6.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
