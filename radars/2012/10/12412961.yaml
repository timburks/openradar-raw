    description: "02-Oct-2012 11:56 AM William Gray:\r\nSummary: Builds failing to launch/run on devices running iOS 4.3 and in iPhone 5.1 Simulator after a successful build in Xcode 4.5.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Build and run project in Xcode for iPhone 5.1 Simulator or on an iOS 4.3 device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Application should launch.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Application crashes with following error in Xcode debug console:\r\n\r\ndyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _objc_setProperty_nonatomic\r\n  Referenced from: /Users/billy/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications/6FDBB660-74E6-4054-8C9B-9D76F37FDFB5/Strip.app/Strip\r\n  Expected in: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Foundation\r\n\r\ndyld: Symbol not found: _objc_setProperty_nonatomic\r\n  Referenced from: /Users/billy/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications/6FDBB660-74E6-4054-8C9B-9D76F37FDFB5/Strip.app/Strip\r\n  Expected in: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Foundation\r\n\r\nRegression: Not that we're aware of.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFew reports of this on the web, vague solutions described. We tried setting deployment target to 4.3 from 4.2 as others had suggested, but this has not fixed the problem. I'd like to send you the zipped up project in case this is something related to our project settings, but compressed, with unrelated files pruned, it's still 161MB, over the attachment limit here. Perhaps outdated settings from years ago are having an effect?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n02-Oct-2012 11:56 AM William Gray:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-10-02 at 11.42.02 AM.png' and 'Strip.xcodeproj.zip' were successfully uploaded"
