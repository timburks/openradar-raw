    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe code snippet library has a snippet for dispatch_after:\r\n\r\nint64_t delayInSeconds = 2.0;\r\ndispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, delayInSeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC);\r\ndispatch_after(popTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){\r\n    <#code to be executed on the main queue after delay#>\r\n});\r\n\r\nthe delay in seconds is typed to int64_t, bu the initial value from the snippet is 2.0;\r\n\r\nI think this would be better as 2;"
