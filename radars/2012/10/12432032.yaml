        Summary:
        Xcode 4.4 doesn't provide a way to switch teams in the Organiser

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make sure you have used multiple different developer accounts with Xcode in the past, including ones on different Apple IDs, and have saved the password in your keychain (a reasonable thing to do)
        2. Try to add a device to the portal, via the "Add to Portal" button

        Expected Results:
        A dialog box appears asking you to choose a team, with an "Other" button available.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode assumes you mean one of your previous choices. In my case, it happened to be an AppleID that has an expired account, so all I got was a sheet saying "The selected team's program membership has expired.  Please visit the Member Center to renew your program membership. http://developer.apple.com/membercenter "

        Notes:
        Xcode already has a team list in its organiser sidebar. Perhaps that could be expanded to allow adding/removing/editing the teams, including showing which AppleID is associated with each one. Then, any operations that talk to the portal should give you a popup menu showing all the teams in the sidebar.
