    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPresently, MPMoviePlayerViewController only accepts an NSURL as it's initialising value. When working with movies stored in Core Data, this means that I need to save the contents of the binary attribute (an NSData instance) down to disk before I can start playing the movie back. Often this results in a wait for the user of many seconds.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could just pass an NSData instance to MPMoviePlayerViewController, and have the movie play back from directly within the Core Data store."
