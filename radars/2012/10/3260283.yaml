    description: "15-May-2003 10:40 PM Daniel Jalkut:\r\nI am trying to set the cursor while tracking a Carbon menu that I display with PopUpMenuSelect.  I want to convey different functionality to the user by changing the cursor when they hold down a specific modifier key.\r\n\r\nSince my application is a background only application, it appears the system will not let me have control over the cursor.  This seems wrong given that at the time that I attempt to set the cursor, I am in complete control of the UI.  The system should make some exception to the \"must be the active app\" rule if there is some UI being managed that is the complete focus of the user's activity.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. From a background only application, install an NSStatusItem with a custom view that tracks mouse clicks.\r\n2. While the mouse click is being tracked, attempt to change the cursor with either [NSCursor set] or SetCCursor.\r\n\r\nRESULT: No effect unless your background-only application is somehow \"active\" (e.g. an about box window displayed by the app is visible and frontmost).\r\n\r\nExpected results: Any UI that is the locked focus of the user should have the power to change all the usual aspects of the user experience, including the cursor image.\r\n\r\nI would be happy if somebody could give me some kind of workaround to this problem for the short term.  I notice that some background processes are able to set the cursor with wild abandon.  For example /usr/sbin/screencapture is invoked by the CMD-Shift-4 FKEY and appears to have no problem setting the cursor even while another app is frontmost.  Examining the tool with gdb, I see that it does some funny stuff with creating windows (invisible?) and setting their window level.  I am liable to pursue some workaround on my own but would be very grateful if you could give me a workaround that will both work and be \"least offensive to the system.\"\r\n\r\nThanks!"
