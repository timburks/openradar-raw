    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn the early Developer Previews of OS X Mountain Lion, the Notification Center menubar item would glow blue when there were new notifications in Notification Center. That feature was removed in a later Developer Preview. Now that that feature has been removed, users need to remember to open Notification Center to see if there are any new notifications, which means users don't always know that there are notifications waiting for them, so notifications pile up. I would like that \"new notifications\" indicator back, please.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Remove all notifications from Notification Center.\r\n2. Receive an alert-style notification.\r\n3. Don't do anything to the notification and let it slide into Notification Center.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe Notification Center menubar icon should glow blue or indicate in some way to the user that there are new notifications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Notification Center menubar icon stays black, and the user has to actively go and open Notification Center if they want to find out whether there are any new notifications.\r\n\r\nRegression: 10.8 DP3\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
