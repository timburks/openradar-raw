    description: "Summary: Deleting a message with a media attachment from the iMessages app doesn't delete the file in the filesystem. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nCheck size of iCloud backup and \"Other\" on iTunes and note the size.\r\nSend an iMessage with a 2minute video file attached.\r\nCheck size of iCloud backup and \"Other\" on iTunes and not the size.\r\nDelete the message with the video.\r\nCheck size of iCloud back and \"Other\" on iTunes. Size hasn't decreased as expected. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: iCloud backup size and \"Other\" on iTunes decreases by the filesize of the media attachment.\r\n\r\nActual Results: iCloud backup size doesn't decrease, wasting iCloud storage space. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have confirmed that the media isn't deleted by using third party backup recovery software. After removing the media message and backing up to iTunes, I used the software to view the iMessage attachments. The video file I deleted is still there, even though I've deleted the message."
