    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAdding Google as a CardDAV provider does not work as expected. The added account is mistakenly categorized as a Google account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open System Preferences\r\n2. Under \"Internet & Wireless\", select \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\"\r\n3. Select the plus sign in the bottom right, to add an account\r\n4. On the right hand pane, choose the  \"Add Other Account...\" option\r\n5. Select \"Add a CardDAV account\" and click \"Create\"\r\n6. Fill in the User Name field with the full email address of a valid Google account\r\n7. Fill in the Password field with the password to the account\r\n8. Fill in the Server Address field with \"google.com\"\r\n8. Click Create\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe entry for the account on the left side should have a contacts icon, with the details for the CardDAV account on the right\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe entry for the account on the left side has a Google icon, with the details for a standard Google account on the right. This is an incorrect classification. The settings for the CardDAV account cannot be accessed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nOnly tested on 10.8.2 on my MacBook Air.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis could perhaps be part of a larger refactor, removing the Google Contacts sync option from Address Book, and adding Contacts to the Google account type in System Preferences, using CardDAV."
