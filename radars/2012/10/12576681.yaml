    description: "25-Oct-2012 04:25 PM Heath Borders:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the attached project, there is a a deallocated object that is called by UIScrollView, which crashes. I expect NSZombieEnabled to catch these errors, but it fails to do so when ARC is also enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached project, observe the crash.\r\n2. Turn on NSZombieEnabled, observe the crash and lack of exception thrown when the deallocated object is referenced.\r\n3. Turn off ARC and NSZombieEnabled, observe the crash.\r\n4. Turn off ARC and turn on NSZombieEnabled, observe the exception thrown when the deallocated object is referenced.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSZombieEnabled should throw an exception when a deallocated object is referenced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo exception is thrown and the application crashes just like when NSZombieEnabled is turned off.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n25-Oct-2012 04:30 PM Heath Borders:\r\n'UIScrollViewDelegateNilCrash-2.zip' was successfully uploaded"
