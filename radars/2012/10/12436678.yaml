    description: "04-Oct-2012 01:44 PM iwilliams:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe VoiceOver functionality in iOS 6, when display navigation step cards, states that the adjustable slider should slide up and down with one finger.  This is present on iOS 6 on my iPhone 4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. When viewing directions in Maps and using VoiceOver, the adjustable \"slider\" states that sliding up and down will adjust the value.\r\n\r\n2. When sliding up and down with one finger, the VoiceOver feedback sounds as though values are being changed, but direction cards are not actually advancing or changing at all.\r\n\r\n3. To advance the direction card, one must double tap and drag left or right to do so, contrary to the VoiceOver instructions.\r\n\r\n4. Aside from the VoiceOver audio that the drag has been actuated, there is no audio indication when dragging left or right, nor is there an audio indication when the next direction card has been displayed. Tapping on the direction card when it is on the display does correctly read the current card.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• VoiceOver should indicate to the user that the correct drag action is left and right, not up and down.\r\n• Dragging up and down should not actuate feedback indicating a change in the information displayed.\r\n• Dragging left and right should actuate feedback indicating a change in the information displayed.\r\n• Though not required, it would be useful to have the next direction card be automatically spoken to the user upon being displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe VoiceOver directions for utilizing Maps and directions are incorrect and misleading.\r\n\r\nI am not visually impaired, and had I not been able to see the navigation features on screen and how it is intended to be used, this would have been a very confusing and frustrating experience.\r\n\r\nThe only way to use navigation properly with VoiceOver in its current state would be to click and drag randomly on screen to find the correct behavior, or have someone without visual impairment inform the user of the proper action to take.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI did not attempt this process on older versions of iOS.\r\n\r\n04-Oct-2012 03:36 PM iwilliams:\r\nFor the sake of clarity, I reproduced this issue on an iPhone 4.\r\n\r\nSome colleagues of mine have tested this on an iPhone 4S, and Siri does not appear to have the same issue on newer hardware based on the video I saw.\r\n\r\nIf this issue is only present on non-Siri enabled hardware, I suspect the issue would also apply to the iPhone 3GS, and the iPad 2, neither of which I have available for testing."
