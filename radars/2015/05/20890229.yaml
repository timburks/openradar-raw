        Summary:
        Calculator.app in iOS should have feedback UI when user tap '=' (equal). If user divide a number with its root value and then tap equal, it looks like Calculator.app doesn’t do anything which looks like a bug.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Calculator.app in iPhone
        2. Enter ‘625’, ÷ and ’25
        3. Press =

        Expected Results:
        Calculator.app calculate the result (which is 25) display it and has some kind of feedback ui (flashing for example)

        Actual Results:
        Calculator.app calculate the result (which is 25) display it without any feedback

        Regression:
