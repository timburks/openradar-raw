        Summary:
        Simulators became unavailable from the target menu following deletion of Xcode 6.3 and installation of Xcode 6.3.2 (both from dmg, not from app store, as I like to have multiple versions available as needed). I always rename before launching (from Xcode.app to Xcode-6.3.2.app, for instance).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        This is probably going to suck to try to reproduce, but:
        1. Install 6.3 (first GM release) and use it
        2. Install 6.3.2, alongside, named appropriately
        3. Delete 6.3
        4. Launch 6.3.2.

        Expected Results:
        Simulators available and visible

        Actual Results:
        No simulators visible in target dropdown, nor in devices. Running xcrun commands to list them, hung.

        Regression:
        Iâ€™ve done this process many times with betas alongside. Never had this happen to me although, once did happen to a colleague.

        Notes:
        @nickjshearer helped me out on Twitter. Lovely guy. Buy him beer. Workaround was to delete the CoreSimulator folder and reboot.
