    description: "As mobile apps continue to grow, entire projects may no longer be a granular enough level for localization. Our project, specifically, would benefit greatly from being able to limit localization to individual targets within a project.\r\n\r\nI suggest adding a \"target\" flag to the \"xcodebuild -exportLocalizations\" command line:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -exportLocalizations -localizationPath <dirpath> -project <projectname> -target <targetname> [[-exportLanguage <targetlanguage>]]\r\n\r\nIn this example, the \"-target <targetname>\" portion has been added. If specified, it would limit the action to files included within the specified target rather than to all files included in the project.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there should be a command line method of ingesting updated localization XLIFF files. There is not currently an \"xcodebuild -importLocalizations\" flag."
