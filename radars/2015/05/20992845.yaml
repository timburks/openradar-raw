    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I don't choose to send an outgoing message as an audio file or a transcription before the display falls asleep, the message will be lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Messages app on the Watch.\r\n2. Select a contact in the list of messages.\r\n3. Scroll to the bottom and tap Reply\r\n4. Tap the microphone to record audio\r\n5. Tap Done\r\n6. Allow Watch to fall asleep while the screen is on the selection for Audio or Text.\r\n7. Wake the Watch back up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessage should still be on the screen to select between Audio or Text. This is how it works if the contact is selected from Friends instead of the Messages app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen is back on the conversation thread with the contact selected on step 2. The message is completely forgotten.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5S, iOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\nWatch Sport (model M2U2LL/A) with OS 1.0 (12S507)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
