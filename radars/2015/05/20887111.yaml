        Summary:
        Mistakenly passing in a function to a generic function, because you left out the parentheses after the function name can silently fail, and cause bugs.

        If one has  a generic function that takes element V :

        func encode<V>(element: V?, forKey key: String) {
                if let e = element {
                   do something with element
                }
        }

        At the call site the programmer does something like this:
        encoder.encode(Item.version, forKey:Item.versionKey)

        Item.Version is a  function, so this was a mistake and they really meant to call the function:
        encoder.encode(Item.version(), forKey:Item.versionKey)

        This causes a silent failure in this case.

        Notes: In this example, version should probably be a calculated property. This can probably be circumvented with conventions, and practices, however I have run in to this myself a few times, and it is kind of scary knowing this potential error can be made. I just wanted to run it by you guys to let you know.
