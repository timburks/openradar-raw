    description: "Summary:\r\nSchool systems need a way to ensure students cannot turn off BlueTooth. Without this ability, investing in iBeacon technology is a waste of resources for a K-12 district. We could provide extra capabilities, and be sure devices have the in-school configurations we require, if the students cannot turn BT off. At the minimum, we should be able to turn it back on when the device is inventoried, in a similar way that the device's name can be set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhy is this field necessary for an Enhancement request?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhy is this field necessary for an Enhancement request?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhy is this field necessary for an Enhancement request?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 4th Generation (Wi-Fi)"
