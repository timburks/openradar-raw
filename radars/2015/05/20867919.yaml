    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a Swift framework for either the Mac or iOS and not linking with Foundation it still appears at the top of the auto-generated header for that framework.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode's Framework template for Mac or iOS to create a new framework.\r\n2. Remove any references to Foundation and do not link against it.\r\n3. Create a new project.\r\n4. Link with the framework that was just created and import it into a file.\r\n5. CMD+Click the import to jump to the autogenerated header.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFoundation appears nowhere on the list of imports at the top of the auto-generated header.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFoundation appears despite not being linked or imported anywhere.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4 (6E14)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
