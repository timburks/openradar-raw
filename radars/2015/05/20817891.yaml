    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Activity app only shows workout data from the watchâ€™s Workout app. The Workout app is great for cardio, but it not really useful for other type of workout (like lifting weights). I use another app to track those workouts and they are synced to the Health app. The calories recorded (and maybe the minutes?) there should should up on the goals in the Activity app. On the iPhone version of Activity, they should show up in the Workouts section.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do a workout in a third party, HealthKit enabled app. I used FitnessBuilder.\r\n2. Save the workout to HealthKit.\r\n3. Open the Health app to verify that it has been recorded.\r\n4. Open the Activity app and verify that it is missing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe workout would be visible in the Activity app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe workout is not visible in the Activity app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
