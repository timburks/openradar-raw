        Summary:
        When adding a Mac OS X framework target to an Xcode project, and  Swift as your chosen language,  the build setting “Embedded Content Contains Swift Code” should be set to ‘Yes” not ‘No’ for that target.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Start a new Xcode project, selecting an iOS framework type, with swift as your language.
        2) Add a Mac OS X target to the project.
        3) Attempt to run tests on the Mac OS X target.

        Expected Results:
        Expect test to run

        Actual Results:
        In the console you get an error “Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib”

        Regression:
        I only know that it occurs in the case listed in Steps above, but may occur or not occur in other cases.
