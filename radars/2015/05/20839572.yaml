    description: "Summary:\r\nAdding a `width: 1%;` style to a nested table cell causes its sibling cell to hog horizontal space.\r\nFirefox and IE11/Edge don't suffer from this problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsfiddle.net/eejzdf4a/ in Safari.\r\n2. Look at the Result pane in the lower-right of the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the portion of the example titled \"Wonky\", the green and yellow cells\r\nshould each take up a somewhat equal amount of horizontal space.\r\nThe green and yellow cells should have the same boundaries that they do\r\nin the portion of the example titled '\"Fixed\" by removing the one-percent class'.\r\n(See the Firefox screenshot. IE11/Edge gives the same result as Firefox.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn the portion of the example titled \"Wonky\", the green cell takes up a\r\nvery small amount of horizontal space, whereas the yellow cell\r\ntakes up almost all of the horizontal space.\r\nThe green and yellow cells have different boundaries than they do\r\nin the portion of the example titled '\"Fixed\" by removing the one-percent class'.\r\n(See the Safari screenshot.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPlatform: OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\nSafari Version: 8.0.5 (10600.5.17)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWebKit bug:\r\n    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144696\r\nBootstrap bug report:\r\n    https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/16372\r\nOriginal corresponding Chrome bug report:\r\n    https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=427994\r\nOther, more complex example of the bug, that uses Bootstrap:\r\n    http://jsfiddle.net/rq3shh3t/2/\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'bug.png' and 'example-eejzdf4a.html' were successfully uploaded."
