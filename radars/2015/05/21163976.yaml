    description: "CLGeoder already provides time zone information for reverse geocoded locations. However it is deeply buried in the textual -description of the returned CLPlacemark object.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see an official property:\r\n\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSTimeZone *timeZone;\r\n\r\nThen we don't have to write ugly parsing code like this: https://gist.github.com/chriscdn/1cd899fc47fb4b887bf5"
