    description: "Summary:\r\nI believe this bug was introduced in 10.10.3. I never hit this until 10.10.3, and have hit it nearly every day since upgrading. \r\n\r\nIt seems that in some scenarios, clicking a terminal window will trigger what I assume is some type of drag/highlight gesture recognizer. That's fine... except that when mouse-up happened the GR didn't deactivate. This causes the GR to sit there in -[NSApplication nextEventMatchingMask:untilDate:inMode:dequeue:], waiting for mouse up. \r\n\r\nWhen in this state, typing does not print characters to the screen. The terminal is seemingly locked up. But when you mouse down/mouse up, the terminal will then process your key presses and you'll get the expected result. As you can imagine, having to click to see your commands is suboptimal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThese steps are not guaranteed to repro. I haven't been able to reproduce it on demand. But here's what almost always triggers it for me when it does happen\r\n\r\n1. Full-zoomed terminal (not 'Full Screen', just as large as possible on your screen)\r\n2. Full-zoomed Safari window on top of Terminal\r\n3. cmd-tab from Safari to Terminal\r\n4. While app switcher is still up, click on Terminal window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the terminal window to come to the front\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nterminal window comes to the front, but i see that text is selected. Usually moving the mouse selects more text. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 14D131\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached process samples of Terminal.app when this happens. Clearly shows the gesture recognizer waiting around.\r\n\r\nOnly workaround i've found is to kill terminal.app (can't quit it, have to force quit), then restart it. Annoying.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNothing interesting to note here"
