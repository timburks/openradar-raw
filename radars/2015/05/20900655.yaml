        Summary:
        When trying to create a Photos library on iCloud Drive (which is not supported by Photos), the error message displayed to the user does not tell them why creating the library failed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Photos with the option key held down
        2. Click the “Create New…” button
        3. Select iCloud Drive as the location to store the library, then click OK to create the library

        Expected Results:
        Since iCloud Drive is not supported by Photos, I would expect to see an error message saying something along the lines of “Storing your Photos library on iCloud Drive is not supported”

        Actual Results:
        The error message displayed is “An unexpected error has occurred. Please quit and restart the application.” An error message is also output to the console log, shown below, which gives some clue as to why the creation failed. 99% of users will never look for this information though.
