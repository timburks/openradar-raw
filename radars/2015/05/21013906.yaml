        Summary:
        Currently, Apple Watch’s “talk to your phone over WiFi” support doesn’t work if your phone is connected to a different access point from your watch, even if both APs are part of the same network. This should change.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set up two AirPort Extremes, connected by Ethernet, far enough apart that their signal areas don’t overlap.
        2. Put your phone next to one AirPort.
        3. Stand near the other AirPort with your watch.
        4. Try to use Siri, iMessage, or one of the other features intended to work over WiFi.

        Expected Results:
        The features work.

        Actual Results:
        They do not. Both devices must be connected to the same access point to communicate; two different access points, even on the same network, is not good enough.

        Notes:
        I discovered this during AppleCare support case #795250044.

        My home has a lot of concrete in its construction; this leads to severe difficulties transmitting EM signals through the entire house. To cope with this, we have three GSM microcells and five AirPort access points (various models, mostly a few years old). I literally can’t walk from my bedroom to my kitchen without changing APs.

        This issue seriously affects the usefulness of the Apple Watch for me. One of the major reasons I wanted it was so I could leave my phone in one area of the house while I’m in another area; this isn’t really possible as long as this multiple-access-point issue exists.
