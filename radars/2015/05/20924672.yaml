    description: "Summary:\r\nAs the title says, port can only be auto, any attempt to change the port in the prefs is futile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts\r\n2. Add a CalDAV server\r\n3. Go to \"Server Settings\"\r\n4. Port is empty, placeholder says \"Auto\"\r\n5. Type in a number in the ports text field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can unfocus the text field and my port is being used or at least tested.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI cannot unfocus the text field, but I get no error message dialog either (as I do when entering something that is not a number), the text field stays focused and even switching the tabs or toolbar icons has no effect anymore. Also I never see any attempt to connect to that port with tcpdump.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacOS 10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
