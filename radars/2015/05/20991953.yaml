    description: "Summary:\r\nA Cocoa document-based app that was compiled against the 10.9 SDK or earlier will crash reliably when the document naming/tagging UI is dismissed by clicking out into the content of the document window.\r\n\r\nUsers of my app Black Ink have reported this crash to me and I've narrowed it down to being particular to the SDK linkage. Evidently behaviors of the remote view popover are altered when linked against 10.10 SDK sufficient to avoid the crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis affects my shipping app, Black Ink, which is downloadable here: http://red-sweater.com/blackink/, but for the purposes of a concise example case, I've used Apple's own TextEdit sample code. The only change I made to the attached TextEdit project was to change the SDK from 10.10 to 10.9:\r\n\r\n1. Open attached TextEdit.xcodeproj\r\n2. Build and Run\r\n3. Create a new document and type something in it.\r\n4. Click the \"Edited\" indicator in the window title bar to bring up naming/tagging UI.\r\n5. Click back into the document content to dismiss the document popover.\r\n\r\nIf a crash doesn't happen immediately, try repeating these steps a few times until it crashes. In my experience it's pretty reliable but does sometimes seem to take a second try.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe panel should be dismissed without incident.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash with attached log.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.4 (14E17e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2014 MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TextEdit_2015-05-17-140058_Macho.crash' and 'TextEditCrasher.zip' were successfully uploaded."
