    description: "Summary:\r\nI can only configure a keyboard shortcut to \"Show Notification Center\" but I would also have a way to easily switching between the two main tabs, \"Today\" and \"Notifications\", just using the keyboard. E.g. just using 1 and 2 here would make a good shortcut or left/right keys would work fine as well. Tabbing to get the tabbar focused is a bit cumbersome. The whole Notification Center could get some better keyboard assistance IMHO.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Notification Center\r\n2.  Try to quickly switch between the two main tabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is easily possible to do so with keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's cumbersome at best, only if \"All Controls\" is set on the Shortcuts pref pane, otherwise not possible at all."
