        Summary:
        My last build on 5/19/2015 succeeded, but my first on 5/21 failed, without any significant change to code or the server environment. My provisioning profiles, however, had expired on 5/20/2015. New ones were generated without any participation on my part. But builds on Xcode Server started failing with this message:

        Multiple matching codesigning identities found: Multiple codesigning identities (i.e. certificate and private key pairs) matching “Mac Developer: OS X Server (N________L)” were found.

        Following the steps I describe in this Stack Overflow answer, I was able to see and remove the duplicate signing identity (in Portal.keychain):
