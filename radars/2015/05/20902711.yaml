    description: "Summary:\r\nA phone can be pretty distracting when driving a car, let alone on a watch right in front of you. I would love it if the system could detect I was in a car and switch on Do Not Disturb automatically. Looks like the system can already detect if the user is in a car using CMMotionActivity’s automotive property.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor the duration of an automotive trip, Do Not Disturb should be switched on automatically. When I stand up it should turn off. This feature should be optional.\r\n\r\nCurrent Results:\r\nI get notifications in my pocket and on my wrists whilst driving. I’m quite disciplined and can resist, I’m not sure everyone is like that.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAt the end of the day, this feature could save lives. I see too many people texting whilst driving, implement this before Apple hits the headlines with “Major accident caused by driver playing with his Apple Watch!”."
