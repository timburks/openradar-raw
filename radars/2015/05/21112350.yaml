    description: "Summary:\nThe new crash reporting UI introduced in Xcode 6.3 includes crashes coming from assert() or fatalError(). However, nowhere in that UI is the error message included, which makes debugging crashes an impossible task.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nForce a crash:\n\nfatalError(“This is a sample crash. My message won’t be displayed in Xcode :(”);\n\nExpected Results:\nThe message “This is a sample crash. My message won’t be displayed in Xcode :(“ is included along with the crash report in Xcode’s organizer. \n\nActual Results:\nOnly the stack trace is visible.\n\nNotes:\nPotentially related: rdar://21112288"
