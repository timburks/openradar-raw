    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen throwing an NSException in a 64bit iOS app, if there is a function that does not support 64bit exceptions in the callstack between the @throw and the @catch, the exception is not caught and the app instead terminates with a fatal error.\r\n\r\nThis can easily happen when using 3rd-party C libraries, which are often compiled without the flag required to add ObjC exception support since this is not advertised anywhere or warned about.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the documentation on exception-handling to note the issue.\r\n\r\nI would expect the LLVM compiler to emit a warning by default when compiling ARM64 code without exception support, or to enable the required flag by default.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe documentation makes no mention of the issue.\r\n\r\nThe compiler does not warn when compiling code that can cause this issue.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS / ARM64\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
