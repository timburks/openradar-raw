    description: "Hi,\r\n\r\ni've an app that uses a coverflow like navigation. I use SceneKit for this. \r\nOn iPad Air everything works as expected. You can tap on the spine of each cover and it will open and the current one is closing. You can also swipe left and right. \r\nWhen i run then same code on iPad 4 or iPad 2 it behaves very strange after some taps. Covers disappear randomly and change their position.\r\nThis behavior can also be reproduced in iPad2 Simulator.\r\n\r\nI found what causes the problem. When i remove all â€žsetTimingMode:SCNActionTimingModeEaseInEaseOut\" everything works fine. \r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nBernhard\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run application on iPad Air Simulator or on iPad Air Device\r\n2. Touch on some of the purple spines to see the expected behavior \r\n3. Run application on iPad Retina Simulator, iPad 2 Simulator or on iPad 4 or iPad 2 Device\r\n4. Touch again on some of the purple spines and you see some Covers disappear or changing their position in a strange way\r\n\r\nOn iPhone you can see the same issue. On iPhone 6 everything works as expected but on iPhone 5 not.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCovers should open and close.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn all devices other than iPad Air and iPhone 6 Covers disappear randomly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air iOS 8 iPad 4 iOS 8, iPad 2 iOS 8, iPhone 6 iOS 8, iPhone 5 IOS 8, iPad Simulator"
