    description: "Summary:\r\nOccasionally, we will try to launch our WatchKit app from the Apple Watch, and the gray built-in spinner just spins endlessly. We never see our app launch. When digging into this, we found the attached logs that tell us that the iPhone is unable to start the WatchKit Extension. Through this, we figured out that the only workaround is rebooting the iPhone (force quitting the app, rebooting the Watch, and reinstalling the app do NOT help).\r\n\r\nWe're not able to figure out how the iPhone gets into this state, but once it gets in this state, it's impossible to launch our WatchKit Extension until the iPhone is rebooted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnclear how to reproduce, but please view logs to see the exact problem\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe WatchKit Extension should always be launchable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the iPhone is not able to launch the WatchKit Extension\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, Watch OS 1.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'watchlogs.txt' was successfully uploaded."
