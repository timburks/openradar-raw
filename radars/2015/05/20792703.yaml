    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you create a xib file manually, and a class file manually, Xcode doesn't let you create properties by drag-dropping from IB into the class header in the side-by-side assistant.\r\n\r\nYou can still drag-drop into the .m file, which creates an instance variable, but not a property.\r\n\r\nAfter you define the first property manually, Xcode lets you define new ones by drag and dropping.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create new Xcode project, \"iOS Simple View Application\" template.\r\n2. right click project, \"Add new file\"->\"iOS User Interface\", select the \"View\" template, to crate a new xib. Name it \"View\".\r\n3. right click project, \"Add new file\"->\"iOS Source\"->\"Cocoa Touch Class\". Name the class \"View\", and make it a subclass of \"UIView\".\r\n4. open xib file, and change the \"custom class->class\" of the view selected to \"View\".\r\n5. add a simple UIButton to the view\r\n6. change xcode to the side-by-side view, the \"Assistant editor\".\r\n\r\n7. right click on button, try to create a new referencing outlet to the View.h file. Xcode won't let you.\r\n\r\n8. right click on button, try to create a new referencing outlet to the View.m file. Xcode will try to create an instance variable.\r\n\r\n9. Now on the View.h file, define a simple property like:\r\n\r\n@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIView *test;\r\n\r\n10. repeat step 7, Xcode will let you do it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should let you create properties on header files on the first try.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't create the properties by drag and dropping until you first define a property manually.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProject attached was created following the same steps above. Here, opening that project will still reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNothing special, brand new project."
