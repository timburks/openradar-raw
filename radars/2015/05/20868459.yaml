    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connecting a TV (or other external monitor) using the HDMI adapter (or AirPlay, or whatever) to an iPad, and running an app that attaches a UIWindow with a rootViewController to the UIScreen of that TV, the iPad's orientation should not affect the orientation of the image on the TV.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write an app that attaches a UIWindow with a rootViewController to any connected UIScreens (see attached sample)\r\n2. Rotate your iPad into landscape\r\n3. Attach an external monitor to the iPad\r\n4. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. The image on your TV is right-side-up\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. The image on your TV is sideways with a black bar along the edge\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression since iOS 7, and is caused by the orientation compensation code in UIScreen added in iOS 8. I'm guessing I'm the only one in the universe that uses UIWindows attached to UIScreens... :( I love that feature though, don't remove it!!!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9rg0nok4mm80pn2/UIScreenWithWindowIOS8OrientationBug.zip?dl=0"
