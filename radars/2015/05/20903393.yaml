    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen PRODUCT_NAME of the app target contains a question mark, the app builds fine and (after the usual hassle with bad provisioning profiles) can be successfully submitted to the App Store from Xcode. However, after 15 minutes iTunes Connect sends an error message:\r\n\r\nInvalid Signature - A sealed resource is missing or invalid. The binary at path [Where To?.app/Where To?] contains an invalid signature. Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate. Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level (which override any values at the project level). Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target. If you are certain your code signing settings are correct, choose \"Clean All\" in Xcode, delete the \"build\" directory in the Finder, and rebuild your release target. For more information, please consult https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a question mark to PRODUCT_NAME of an app project (possibly including a framework and a WK app).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should either be accepted or fail with an **informative** error message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt the very last step (>15 minutes after hitting submit in Xcode), iTunes connect sends the above error message.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nunknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe chose to put a question mark into PRODUCT_NAME to work around rdar://20187512 (WatchKit: iPhone \"Apple Watch\" app doesn't display localized app name). Apparently, the Apple Watch app for iPhone displays PRODUCT_NAME, not the localized watch app name.\r\n\r\nAfter fighting with the error message for several hours, we decided to just remove the question mark. Then the app could be submitted just fine."
