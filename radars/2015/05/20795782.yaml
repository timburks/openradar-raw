    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up a basic Text Input Controller with some arguments that is presented from a button action and updates a label, when user selects one of the supplied suggestions, the text input controller will begin exit animation of the rows.  When it does, all but the top row will animate out.  After about 0.5-1 second, the text input controller freezes for a second, with the top row still stuck in its original position, and the entire text input modal view then disappears without completing the animation.\r\n\r\nCode example is attached.  To operate, tap on the \"Present Text Input\" button, and select a value.  The label at top - center will update with the selected value.\r\n\r\nThis was not a problem in beta releases of WatchKit prior to the final release.  This didn't happen when running similar code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample:\r\n1. Call presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions, passing it an array of string values as suggestions.\r\n2. Set the text of a label to the selected value within the presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions callback.\r\n3. Run the code and perform the use case identified in the above description.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText input controller's staggered row dismissal animation performs smoothly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText input controller dismiss animation stutters."
