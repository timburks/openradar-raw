        Summary:
        For example, I don’t use the Stocks app on my iPhone or on my Apple Watch. On the iPhone I can just hide them away in a folder somewhere on my eleventh home screen page. On the watch, where space is even more constrained, I can’t do that. Hiding preinstalled apps doesn’t seem to be possible in any way

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to hide a preinstalled app like the Stocks app from the watch applications screen.

        Expected Results:
        able to hide it

        Actual Results:
        not able to hide it

        Regression:
        n/a
