    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to open certain applications, 10.10.4 is refusing, claiming that they don't pass muster with Dev ID. However, checking with codesign shows that they're fine (and they open fine in 10.10.3 and below).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Fission, Intermission, or Piezo:\r\nhttp://rogueamoeba.com\r\n\r\n2. Attempt to open them on 10.10.4\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe apps should open without a problem (unless the user has Gatekeeper set to Mac App Store only).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe apps fail to open, with the OS claiming the identity of the developer can't be identified\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.4 (14E11f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis may also be relevant: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/270071"
