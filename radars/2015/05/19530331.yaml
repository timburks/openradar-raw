    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes apps want to store highly sensitive data in the keychain that will only stay there for a limited amount of time. The problem is that the app itself can only enforce that as long as it is running. As iOS may kill background apps at any time, it often has no way to remove the data once the time limit has been reached. However iOS could probably do that. Thus keychain entries should get a timebomb date (or a relative lifetime) and as soon as that date is reached/lifetime is expired, iOS delete that keychain entry on its own even when the app is not running at that moment.\r\n\r\nNote: It is not sufficient to just hide it from the app, for real security, it must be physically and unrecoverably deleted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
