        Summary:

        In the Glances dialog inside the Apple Watch app, one can select any Glance of any app on the iPhone, regardless if they are installed on the watch at the moment.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Install an iOS app with WatchKit extension
        2. Uninstall the app from the watch
        3. Select the app’s glance in the Glances dialog

        Expected Results:

        Either the app should be automatically installed if I pick its glance or it shouldn’t even show up in the glances dialog until it has been installed.

        Actual Results:

        Any app can be picked and selected, it will be ignored if it isn’t already installed on the watch.

        Regression: -
