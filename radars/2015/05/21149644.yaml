        I’m trying to call CenturyLink customer service, so I say “call eight six six four fifty sixty-one fifty-two”. (That is, 866 450 6152.) I can see Siri doing the initial transcription correctly as “call 866-450”, but then when she hears the last four digits, she “corrects” the utterance to “call 664-5060 152” and then complains that it’s not a valid phone number.

        This is 100% reproducible for me. Odd because the 8 just gets dropped in order to split “sixty-one” into “60 1”. I can understand that there’s some ambiguity there, but this is a very odd way to conform the utterance to a ten-digit number.
