    description: "Summary:\r\nNSPersistentDocument is not well-suited to modern, document based Core Data applications. UIManagedDocument on iOS is much better. A modern replacement, or major enhancements to NSPersistentDocument to support the following would be much appreciated:\r\n\r\n- Easily support file wrappers / document packages where the core data store is just a file inside the package.\r\n- Add built in support for multiple Core Data contexts, background saving (good for autosave), etc.\r\n\r\nBSManagedDocument (https://github.com/karelia/BSManagedDocument) is a good example of a third party library that tries to accomplish this. However, real support for this kind of thing from Apple would be superior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to create a document-based OS X app using a package format for documents, supporting autosave/versions, multiple Core Data contexts, etc. using NSPersistentDocument.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt’s easy, and the framework helps you.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt’s nearly impossible, and you end up resorting to subclassing NSDocument and rolling your own solution, which is quite painful."
