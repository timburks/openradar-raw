    description: "Summary:\r\nI've been unable to backup my iPhone via iCloud or iTunes for sometime.\r\n\r\nOn iPhone within iOS backups to iCloud reported:\r\nWhen I tried to back up to iCloud on iPhone I would get “The last backup could not be completed.”\r\n\r\niTunes on Mac reported:\r\n\"iTunes could not back up the iPhone \"Noel's iPhone 6 Plus\" because an error occurred.\"\r\n\r\nI think the last successful back up was 4/25/15. That's from memory as I've since deleted that backup while trying to find a work around.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the console logs from iPhone via Xcode as a backup attempt was performed.\r\n\r\nI observed these two lines (from attached Xcode Log - iPhone.rtf):\r\n\"\r\nMay  6 23:11:48 Noels-iPhone-6-Plus backupd[393] <Warning>: INFO: DeviceID=\"2da0642ab199682f6e700eb19427ac4a5ea1f212\", DeviceName=\"Noel's iPhone 6 Plus\", ProductType=\"iPhone7,1\", BuildVersion=\"12F70\"\r\nMay  6 23:11:48 Noels-iPhone-6-Plus backupd[393] <Warning>: WARNING: stat(\"/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/E4AE9389-89FF-41FD-8757-1653523E221C/Yo.app\"): No such file or directory (2)\r\n\"\r\n\r\nI searched all my app folders for the Yo app, and also Spotlight. It was not found.\r\n\r\nI searched the App Store to attempt a re-install with the goal of deleting it after that. The install wouldn't proceed it was stuck at \"Loading\". I restarted m phone to find that the App said \"Loading\" still but had no shaded area to indicate currently downloading a file. Instead it was the template icon.\r\n\r\nI tried to delete from springboard but it could not be deleted that way.\r\n\r\nI then observed in Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage an app called \"(null)\" with the version 1.5.9. Yo also had a 1.5.9 app released 4-13-15. I deleted the app via this screen.\r\n\r\nAfter this the backup to iCloud proceeded normally. It's in progress now I will update bug if it fails. But previously it failed within 30 seconds so I think I've resolved the issue by deleting the \"(null)\" Yo corrupt app.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the \"(null)\" delete from Manage Storage would have worked initially without my trying to re-download app from the App Store. However I can't say for sure if that's the case.\r\n\r\nThis report is merely to provide improvement and information around the issue. I can't say why the Yo app install became corrupt which is the source of the problem. But it might be useful if/when backup attempts fail that a Support Article recommend the work around I ended up using. A more descriptive surfacing of the log message would be best for regular consumers who are not going to parse console logs in Xcode, etc. If I hadn't figured it out that way I would have likely restored my phone at some point. In fact before I had toggled on and off some iCloud features as attempted work arounds before I found the log mention.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n• iMac15,1 Mac OS 10.10.3 (Public GM 14D136)\r\n• iPhone 6 Plus iOS 8.3 (Public GM)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Console - iTunes Log.rtf', 'iTunes Failure Dialogue.png', 'Manage Storage + iTunes (composite).png' and 'Xcode Log - iPhone.rtf' were successfully uploaded."
