    description: "Summary:\r\nI support a grade 9-12 iPad 1:1 deployment. Sometimes students leave and their iPad is still Activation Locked. Most of the time I can bypass with my MDM (JAMF Casper). Occasionally I cannot, and it seems to be that students have wiped their device and reloaded it in the past.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Enroll a Supervised iPad, allow MDM to get Activation Lock Bypass Code\r\n2) Sign into iCloud, turn on Find my iPad\r\n3) Reset iPad via iTunes Recovery Mode\r\n4) When prompted for Activation Lock Bypass, enter the iCloud credentials\r\n5) Complete iCloud Restore process.\r\n6) Update Inventory in MDM, allow MDM to get Activation Lock Bypass Code\r\n7) Reset iPad via iTunes Recovery Mode\r\n8) When prompted for Activation Lock Bypass, the Code from the MDM **DOES NOT WORK**\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nActivation Lock Bypass Code, when entered into the Password field of the iPad, should clear the Activation Lock and allow the iPad to be Activated again. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReceive error, invalid username/password\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 4th Generation (Wi-Fi), Casper 9.65"
