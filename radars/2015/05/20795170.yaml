    description: "Summary:\r\nI am working on a Golf app for Apple Watch that includes the ability to track scores within a round of play.  I would like to have the ability to select from a range of values for things like selecting a hole on the golf course, selecting a score, and selecting the number of putts using a numeric picker-like control that is controlled by the digital crown.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only methods I have been able to identify for doing tasks like this are to use the text input controller, build a modal with a tableview that behaves like the text input controller, use a slider control and enter values with increment/decrement buttons, or to build something custom that behaves the same way.  A number picker for use cases of this type would be much faster and more intuitive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe use case for this feature would be something like:\r\n1: Select the control containing the number to be modified.  A picker would appear on tap or select.\r\n2: Using the digital crown, navigate through possible values by turning it.\r\n3: Once the user has selected a value, facilitate the ability to confirm through a CTA tap gesture\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the picker is closed, the value would be updated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis control does not exist currently."
