    description: "Summary:\r\nI am in the early stages of building an iOS app that will work in concert with a toothbrush that has an accelerometer which will be used to track brushing habits.  I would like to be able to integrate this data into HealthKit, but am unable to do so, since HealthKit presently has no types to integrate with this kind of data.  I'd like to either have a type available to me in the framework that can support this kind of data, or the ability to add custom data types.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample:\r\nIntegrate accelerometer data from a toothbrush\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can integrate this data, using it to display charts and other important information to the user through HealthKit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have no way to integrate it."
