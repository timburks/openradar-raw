        At first glance, the value of a complication on the watch face seems to be the information it provides. While useful, I find that I use them more and more as a way to quickly interact with my favorite apps.

        The problem now is that Messages, my favorite app on the Apple Watch, does not have a complication. Nor does it have a glance (which is another quick way to get to favorite apps.)

        That leave me with only the option of clicking the digital crown, fiddling around with an array of icons until I find the one that’s mostly green, tapping the icon, then scrolling around in a list of messages. Doing this while performing another activity is both frustrating and dangerous (e.g. driving.)

        Personally, I use Messages a lot more than I use the Calendar. And interestingly, the messages that I send and receive on the watch tend to be very short. I’d much rather see the “On my way” message at the bottom of my Utility watch face than “10:00 Quarterly Review with Acc…”.

        Tapping on a Messages complication would show me the last message that made a “ding” and let me quickly reply by voice or Siri. Ideally, if there haven’t been any messages in the last 30 minutes or so, I’d see something like “NO RECENT MESSAGES” and be able to tap to see all message threads.
