        Summary:

        The zero-width space (U+200B) is a valid character in Swift identifiers. This is quite nasty, because it will be invisible (hence the name) in many editors and can cause huge confusion in being so.

        See https://gist.github.com/neonichu/9dd8e0b7dcabaf3d9b30 for an example program using it.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Compile the example.

        Expected Results:

        Compilation should fail, indicating that an invalid character is used.

        Actual Results:

        Program compiles and runs just fine.

        Regression: -
