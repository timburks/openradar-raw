        At the moment, WatchKit glances are very template-based, in that they always have an upper and lower group. There are many situations where it would make sense to design the glance somewhat differently, for example to have a large circle on the whole screen. Unfortunately, because of the upper/lower group split, this isnâ€™t possible.

        Please provide a template with a single group spanning the whole screen (other than the space at the bottom for page indicator)
