    description: "Summary:\r\nswiftc aborts with \"LLVM ERROR: Broken function found, compilation aborted!\", with some variation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Expose a non-escaping block from C\r\n2. Call that with a non-escaping closure from Swift\r\n3. Attempt to build\r\n3. LLVM abort error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwift correctly generates the @objc_block thunks, builds, and runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLLVM aborts, sometimes with an error \"Incorrect number of arguments passed to called function\" (as in the attached project) or others such as \"Incorrect function signature\" referencing an @thin -> @unowned_callee thunk.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS 10.10.4 (14E11f), Xcode 6.3.1 (6D1002), Swift 1.2 (swiftlang-602.0.49.6)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIssue can be mitigated using a curried function that accepts the Swift non-escaping closure rather than an inline closure capturing the non-escaping closure.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in described scenario always.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CGPathApply.zip' was successfully uploaded."
