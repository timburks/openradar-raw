    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen bridging with Foundation is enabled (as it seems to be all the time always, but that's another radar) there are certain cases where Swift's attempts to unify generic constraints will resolve to NSObject and result in unsafe code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new playground\r\n2. import Foundation\r\n3. Copy and paste the code in the linked gist into the playground:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/CodaFi/27e750c8aad4e3589ff1\r\n\r\n4. Comment and uncomment the Foundation import; line 40 will switch between passing and failing typechecking.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bridging mechanism does not resolve generic type constraints that may result in unsafe code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bridging mechanism provides the typechecker ample opportunity to accidentally unify constraints that result in unsafe code.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4 (6E14)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
