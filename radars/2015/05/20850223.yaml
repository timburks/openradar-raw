        Summary:
        Face detection works OK (CIDetector), but some images that quite clearly have a face in them and “seem” like the face should be easily detected are not being detected.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to detect a face using CIDetector/CIDetectorTypeFace/CIDetectorAccuracyHigh, with this image which is quite clearly of a human face:

        Expected Results:
        I would expect a simple case like this to be detected accurately.

        Actual Results:
        No face is detected.
