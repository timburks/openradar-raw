    description: "Summary:\nMany times in methods, especially initializers you have a parameter with the same name as a property assignment you would like to make. It would be convenient if you could infer self with just a ‘.’ see example below to see how this would change syntax: \n\nExample:\n\nfunc init(instructions: Instructions) {\n        self.instructions = instructions\n    }\n\nWould become:\n\nfunc init(instructions: Instructions) {\n        .instructions = instructions\n    }\n\nNotes:\nThis is consistent with how enums can infer the enum type"
