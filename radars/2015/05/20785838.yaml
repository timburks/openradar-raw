        When editing image names in xcassets files in Xcode, escape brings up autocomplete instead of completing your edits.

        Steps:

        1. Open the attached example project
        2. Start editing the AppIcon image name
        3. Type 'foo' and press escape

        Expected:

        'foo' is left in the text box and you are no longer editing the name

        Actual:

        A list of completion options is shown.

        Notes:

        This is obviously the default text box behavior, but when editing image names in xcassets it isn't the desired behavior.
