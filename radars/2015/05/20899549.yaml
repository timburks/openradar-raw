        Summary:
        When a UITextview has data detectors on it crashes when dismissing a popup on add to contacts.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Run the project attached on an 8.3 device or simulator
        2) Hold finger down on email until popup comes up
        3) choose add to contacts
        4) tap outside of the popover, it goes back to the previous options
        5) Tap outside of the popover again and it will crash.

        Expected Results:
        Expected the popover to dismiss without crashing.

        Actual Results:
        The app crashes instead of dismissing the popover.
