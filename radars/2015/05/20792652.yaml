    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Xcode can't reach a server, it simply fails with an error \"a server with the specified hostname could not be found\". \r\n\r\nThe error message is very generic, and doesn't help you understand what's going on. There's no mention that this is related to a server configured in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. configure Xcode to access a server on your intranet\r\n2. go out of the intranet, where you can't reach the server from\r\n3. close and reopen Xcode, you get the error mentioned in the description.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither we should not get an error, as there's nothing Xcode should be doing with the server during startup, or the error message should explain what the issue is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBad error message displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 6.3.1 6D1002\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is frustrating and happens a lot for users who have internal build machines, but frequently open Xcode from outside of the network.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVanilla Xcode, with Xcode server running on a different machine in an intranet/VPN. \r\nWhen Xcode is executed from a different network, generic error message is displayed."
