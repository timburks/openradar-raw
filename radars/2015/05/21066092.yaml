    description: "Summary:\nThere should be a way for developers to broadcast Apple Watch feature updates to users who have turned off the developers’ apps.  This might look like an app badge (blue/orange dot) within the Apple Watch app’s list of apps that can expand to show the “What’s New” text.  This would incentivize developers to continue their development even though they might not have gotten the right v1 experience.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nn/a\n\nExpected Results:\nUsers should have a way of knowing when a Watch app has been updated with new features or bugs fixed so they know to give it another shot. \n\nActual Results:\nAs it stands, if they remove the Watch app because of an unsatisfactory experience, they might never know to try it again."
