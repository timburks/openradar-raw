    description: "The man page for launchd.plist contains essential documentation for creating launch agents, launch daemons and xpc services. The language used in the documentation is very unix terminology heavy and assumes experienced unix developer knowledge. This is not necessary for the information it is trying to convey, especially in relation to the description of the plist keys for the launchd plist file.\r\n\r\nThe description of the plist keys and perhaps some other information could be moved to for example the daemon and services programming guide. The description of these keys could be updated to be comprehensible for MacOS/iOS Cocoa developers rather than unix developers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRead the launchd.plist man page and then have to ask questions on discussion lists about what the description of the plist keys mean.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTo be able to read the documentation for configuring a LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon without having to become a unix expert."
