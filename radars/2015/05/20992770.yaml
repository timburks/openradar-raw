        Summary:
        Scrolling in PDFs in Preview is quite laggy, rendering at a very low framerate. This made it all the more surprising to me that a trivial document-based PDFView app can scroll through the same documents quite smoothly, even in two-up continuous mode.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a PDF, e.g. http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/darcs/Pig09/papers/icfp-2010-desc/icfp23l-dagand.pdf
        2. Scroll it from top to bottom in single-page continuous mode. (Preview does not offer two-up continuous mode.)


        Expected Results:
        Scrolling as smooth as in a trivial PDFView-based app.


        Actual Results:
        Very low framerates (< 20fps on a top of the line 2014 MacBook Pro Retina).


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        NB: Safari scrolls this document even more slowly than Preview.
