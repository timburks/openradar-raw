    description: "Summary:\r\nI can choose a ringtone for a CardDAV contact, but it just gets lost as soon as I quit the edit screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure a generic CardDAV Server\r\n2. Sync Contacts with that Server\r\n3. For one Contact, change ringtone\r\n4. Store it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRingtone stays stored. The app tries to store the attribute on the server, yet if not possible or supported, it stores this extra info locally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRingtone is lost. Either because the CardDAV server doesn't support this attribute and delivers the card back without ringtone or because iOS doesn't even try to store that value when a custom CardDAV server is configured."
