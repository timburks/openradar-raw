    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"name\" of the keychain entries created by iMessage and/or FaceTime follow no consistent name scheme (\"ids:\", \"IDS:\", \"IDS_temporary:\", \"com.apple.ids\") - looks topsy-turvy to me.\r\n\r\nIt's also impossible to recognize what app these actually belong to. It would be nice if the name could give at least a hint or instead of naming them just \"application password\", name them \"iMessage ...\" or \"FaceTime ...\" or \"Apple ID Service ...\" - after all the fields \"Name\" and \"Kind\" are fully customizable and hopefully you don't use any of them for finding the entry (Account and Where are the only fields one should use for finding keychain entries IMHO).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Keychain Access after using iMessage and FaceTime.\r\n2. Search for \"ids\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect nicely labeled entries that make it obvious what they are good for, why they are there and which applications need them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA mess the average user won't recognize and most likely throw away if he ever discovers keychain access. This is not iOS, users can see keychain here.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
