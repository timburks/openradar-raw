    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached screengrab.\r\nThe proportional width font in the results pane makes it difficult to compare formatted (hex) numbers (that's why the editor pane uses a monospaced font).\r\neg.\r\n8000000000000000\r\nffffffffffffffff\r\n(Alternatively, the context menu for the text includes Show Fonts, but selecting a different font doesn't change anything.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 print formatted (hex) numbers (in a playground).\r\n2 try to read them.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEasily read the formatted (hex) numbers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHard to read / differentiate fffffff vs ffffff (assuming you're also reading this with a proportional width font).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-05-13 at 16.26.10.png' was successfully uploaded.\r\n<Screen Shot just shows some 64-bit hex output with ffffffffffffffff vs 0000000000000000>"
