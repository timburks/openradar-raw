    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for NSFontManager's explicit -target attribute indicates only that -action will be sent to the specified receiver. In fact, in addition to the -action method, the receiver will also be unconditionally sent \"changeAttributes:\". If the receiver doesn't implement changeAttributes:, an exception will be thrown.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way for a developer who is using NSFontManager to know that they must implement -changeAttributes, short of discovering it because of the exception being thrown at runtime during testing or live use of the app.\r\n\r\nThere is a brief mention in the 10.5 AppKit release notes:\r\n\r\nThe -changeAttributes: action message is now targeted to [NSFontManager target].\r\n\r\nThe main documentation for NSFontManager should be updated so that it's made clear that an object set as the \"target\" for an NSFontManager is expected to implement both the specified action (changeFont: by default) AND changeAttributes:.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
