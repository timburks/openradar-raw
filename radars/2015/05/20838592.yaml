    description: "We've been seeing a number of crash logs related to VectorKit in our app. The stack traces seem to imply an issue with tile overlays, though we are not doing any custom tile overlays anywhere in our app.\r\n\r\nIn a previous release, we experienced a MapKit crash for 32-bit iOS 8 users while in the background, so we took corrective steps to remedy that so I'm confident that the issue is not related to that.\r\n\r\nOutside of that, we are not doing anything out of the ordinary with our usage of MapKit.\r\n\r\nThe two attached stack traces profile two different code paths.\r\n\r\nVectorKit1.txt occurs in a map where we are rendering a custom overlay with Core Graphics drawing and several annotations.\r\n\r\nVectorKit2.txt occurs in a map that renders and periodically updates a polyline as well as tracks the user's current location."
