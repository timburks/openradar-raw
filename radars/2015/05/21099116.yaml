    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running a build on an iOS device from Xcode you should not have to unlock the device before building.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the device is locked, you will get an error dialog and have to reinitiate the run process. This is inconvenient and thus leads to less on-device testing.\r\n\r\nIt would be a major improvement if unlocking the device while the error dialog is displayed would continue the launch process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Initiate a build and run of your project on a device (currently locked with passcode)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should be presented with a message dialog : \"Xcode cannot launch applications on “iPhone” as it is currently locked with a passcode. Please unlock the device to launch.\"\r\n\r\nUnlocking the device at this point should continue the launch process and the dialog should go away.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error :\"Xcode cannot launch applications on “iPhone” as it is currently locked with a passcode. Please unlock the device and try again.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\niOS: 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis request is similar to rdar://21093489"
