    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now app privacy access rights is always or never. Either I allow the app to access geo location, photo library, or contacts, or I don't. If I don't allow it, I cannot use certain features. If I allow it, I have no control when then app is accessing the information. While the app may really need access to any of these to perform a specific task if I allow access to it, it will always be able to access that information, even if I'm not performing this task. E.g. how can I know that the app is not tracking my movements all the time in the background an uploading them to some server? How can I know the app is not uploading every new photo I take somewhere?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. See privacy settings for an app, there's only on/off\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA setting like \"Ask me\" so I can decide access on a case to case decision.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll or nothing, always or never, nothing in between.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMaybe the setting would stick around for a while, so I don't get a new dialog all the time. It could stick for a specific time or until the app quits (or any combination of both). I think you got the point."
