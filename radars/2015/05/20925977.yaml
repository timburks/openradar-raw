    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now you can either allow Siri to access the current geo location or you can deny it. If you deny it, no request requiring location is possible (e.g. I cannot ask Siri for a directions how to get somewhere), but when I enable it, then the geo location is accessed and transmitted with __every__ single request made, even if the request has nothing to do with anything that would require that location. Why can't the request be sent w/o location and only if Siri determines that it needs location to answer that request, the request is polled and then Siri can calculate the answer. The only drawback would be a tiny delay for one extra round trip, therefor over 90% of all Siri requests would probably not cause the location to be transmitted anymore."
