    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running a build on an iOS device from Xcode you should not have to unlock the device for each build.\r\n\r\nThere should be an option to allow an iOS device to not lock while connected to a trusted developer Mac, despite having the device set to auto lock and require passcode. When the device is disconnected or the Mac is locked the device shall also lock.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the device is locked, you will get an error dialog and have to reinitiate the run process. This is inconvenient and is a major reason I do less testing on an actual device.\r\n\r\nDisabling the passcode or setting the auto lock timeout to a longer interval does help but introduces security issues.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution could be to not abort the process when the device is locked but to give the user a chance to unlock the device and then continue with deploying and running automatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Initiate a build and run of your project on a device (currently locked with passcode)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS device should wake up and allow installing and debugging without requiring a passcode (or Touch ID) despite having set up the device to require a passcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error :\"Xcode cannot launch applications on “iPhone” as it is currently locked with a passcode. Please unlock the device and try again.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\niOS: 8.3"
