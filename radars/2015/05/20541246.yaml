    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now if a single photo is selected, one can edit the photo description and the photo keywords, but as soon as multiple photos are selected, one can only edit the keywords. Personally I like to give multiple photos the same description if I think these logically belong together but are too little photo or too unimportant to justify an own album. Using keywords seems inappropriate here, as keywords are like \"tags\" to (short, freely mixable, etc.) and not long descriptions (full sentences). Description is a bit like \"Comments\" in iTunes (tags is more like genre in iTunes) and iTunes also allows editing comment of multiple songs at once.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Photos\r\n2. Select two photos\r\n3. Hit CMD+i\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne can edit keywords AND description.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne can only edit keywords but not description.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 (14D131)"
