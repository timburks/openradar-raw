    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Add to Dock\" command (Cmd+Opt+Shft+T) needs better visibility, or else nobody's going to find it without first getting very frustrated. It's not obvious.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Suppose you're a new user of the Mac and VoiceOver. Forget everything you know about OS X.\r\n\r\n2. You are, at some point, wondering how to add an item to the Dock from the keyboard.\r\n\r\n3. Look for the command in every place you would expect to find it.\r\n\r\n4. Eventually, you are grateful to find the help topic in VoiceOver Help.\r\n\r\n5. But not before.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's always bothered me that this command was never more discoverable. It's not in your KB article on keyboard shortcuts on the web [1], for example (even though you eventually listed the Cmd+Opt+V to move). It's not in the menus. It's not even mentioned in the VoiceOver training, though even this would not be adequate as a long-term solution. And whenever the command changes, as it did recently, everybody is thrown off. I appreciate the difficulty of reconciling the need for the keyboard command with the UI paradigm, but I (of course) think keyboard accessibility is important enough to justify the violation.\r\n\r\n[1] https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou need to go to Help (as a last resort) to learn the otherwise undiscoverable command."
