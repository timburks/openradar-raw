    description: "Summary:\r\nExporting my project for localization  (Editor->Export For Localization...) fails producing a dialog stating \"Localization failed to read a strings file. Please check the system log for more details.\"\r\n\r\nThe following entry was in the system log:\r\n\r\nError message: May 21 09:15:15 Richs-MacBook-Pro.local Xcode[93966]: [MT] DVTAssertions: Warning in /SourceCache/IDEFrameworks/IDEFrameworks-7718/IDEFoundation/Localization/IDELocalizationWork.m:434\r\nDetails:  Failed to read strings file \"/Users/richbruchal/devworld/projects/thermos/code/Thermos/Thermos/ViewControllers/InitialSetup/Pages/HydrationVCs/HydrationSetupGoalUpdatedVC/fr-CA.lproj/HydrationSetupGoalUpdatedFooterView.strings\", underlying error:\r\nThe data couldn’t be read because it isn’t in the correct format.\r\nObject:   <IDELocalizationWork>\r\nMethod:   +readStringsWorkForContext:\r\nThread:   <NSThread: 0x7fa5fb8344e0>{number = 1, name = main}\r\nPlease file a bug at http://bugreport.apple.com with this warning message and any useful information you can provide.\r\n\r\nThe file in question, \"HydrationSetupGoalUpdatedFooterView.strings\", has no data in it; its size is 0 bytes. This is correct as there are currently no localizable strings in the xib.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected Xcode to output a translation file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError message\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.2\r\nThe xib files in question were created in a previous version, probably Xcode 6.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm not sure why those .strings files were blank. Other files with no strings have /* No Localized Strings */ in them. If I manually update my .strings files to include that text, the export works."
