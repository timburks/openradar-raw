    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter starting a video stream in Safari which is AirPlaying to an Apple TV, switching out to another app and then back to Safari to resume the stream, the AirPlay stream stops when pressing the sleep/wake button. In order to successfully turn off the screen at this point without interrupting the AirPlay stream, you must tap the iOS pause/play control to stop and resume the movie first, then use sleep/wake to turn off the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a local network Apple TV to AirPlay to from the iOS control center.\r\n2. Open a compatible MP4 video in Safari, begin to play on Apple TV.\r\n3. Press the sleep/wake button to turn off screen and save battery (should work fine).\r\n4. Wake iOS device and navigate to another app or the home screen (check Messages, email, etc.); AirPlay stream may or may not stop at this point.\r\n5. Switch back to Safari, resuming AirPlay video if it had stopped.\r\n6. Press the sleep/wake button to turn off screen and save battery, at which point it also kills the AirPlay stream.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn in-progress AirPlay stream to Apple TV (audio or video) should never cut out unless/until it's specifically paused/stopped, or unless switching to another app with media controls which would potentially act to override with its own AirPlay content. Certainly not when switching to other non-media apps, or when turning the screen off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe AirPlay video stream to Apple TV is severed when pressing the iPhone sleep/wake button, or also when switching away from Safari to another app or the home screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70); Apple TV software 7.2 (7512)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 16GB AT&T, using WiFi on local network with Apple TV (3rd Gen)"
