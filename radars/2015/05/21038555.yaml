    description: "Automatic download is OFF. After updating apps on the iphone, new apps are installed on the watch and active. Trying to uninstall, it either hangs and never resolves to an uninstall, or it 'resolves' but the app is not truly uninstalled and still active, they remain visible on the watch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Ensure \"automatic download\" is turned OFF for the watch.\r\n1. Update apps on the phone\r\n2. Launch Apple Watch app on the phone\r\n3. Go into App Layout\r\n4. New apps show up\r\n5. Go to one of these new apps and click to turn off \"Show App on Apple Watch\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Applications do not override the General watch setting.\r\n2. Applications can be turned off in the Apple Watch app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot able to produce the expected result."
