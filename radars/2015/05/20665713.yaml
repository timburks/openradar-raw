    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to display views above the rest of the application (for example custom in-app notification views, floating views, or other non-fullscreen views above the rest of the application) it is tempting to use a window so that floating UI and the rest of the app can operate independently. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is no public API for opting that window out from influencing interface orientation and status bar. This means that adding another view on top of the main apps window effectively breaks shouldAutorotate and preferredStatusBarStyle in the main app, since these callbacks will go to the root view controller of the top most window.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a public API in the window or root view controller to opt out of trying to control rotation and status bar. \r\n\r\nOne workaround is to have a root view controller of the app that presents the app as one child controller and any floating view as another child controller. However, this has problems with modal presentations and does not work for displaying anything above alerts or above the status bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
