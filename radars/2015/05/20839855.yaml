    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like to send the frames of an animated image as jpeg to save space. The documentation says  \"To cache images for an animation, cache the entire animation as a single UIImage object and then convert that image to an NSData object. You can create such an image object using the animatedImageWithImages:duration: method.\" so it seems that I should be able to do this. However UIImageJPEGRepresentation does not render data for an animated image. I have also tried to cache the frames individually and that did not work. Here is a gist for example code. https://gist.github.com/datinc/3c671cbc2a04fd395122\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUIImage* animatedImage = [UIImage animatedImageWithImages:images duration:0.4];\r\nNSData* data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(animatedImage, 0.3);\r\nUIImage* image = [UIImage imageWithData:data];\r\nNSLog(@\"%ld should equal %ld\", (long)animatedImage.images.count, (long)image.images.count);\r\n[[WKInterfaceDevice currentDevice] addCachedImageWithData:data name:@\"image\"]\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n[self.wkimage setImageNamed:@\"image\"];\r\n[self.wkimage startAnimating];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnimated images are jpeg\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIImage is not serializes to include animation. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLatest\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
