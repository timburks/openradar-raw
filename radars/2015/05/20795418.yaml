    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd like to be able to incorporate vertical paging functionality into some of the views of my watch app.  Apple's Activity app for Apple Watch has this feature currently.  The Activity home view - the first of the 4 paging views in Activity - can page up and down, and will snap, paging style, when the user scrolls off-screen content partially into view.  \r\n\r\nPlease add this to WatchKit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample 1:\r\n1. In a scrollable view with vertical paging enabled, where another view exists offscreen, swipe up or down.\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n1. In a scrollable view with vertical paging enabled, where another view exists offscreen, drag the offscreen view partially into view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExample 1: \r\nView snaps to offscreen view\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\nView snaps back to current onscreen view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis does not exist in the framework currently."
