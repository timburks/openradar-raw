        Example:

        * The current documentation of `UISearchBar` says that it conforms to `UITextInputTraits`.
        * Therefore a `UISearchBar` supports the method `enablesReturnKeyAutomatically`.
        * The method `enablesReturnKeyAutomatically` says that it is supported from iOS 2.0 onwards.
        * But calling `enablesReturnKeyAutomatically` on a `UISearchBar` on iOS 7.0 will crash.
        * This is because `UISearchBar` only conforms to `UITextInputTraits` since iOS 7.1.
        * The current documentation cannot represent that fact - but it should be added. A compile error would also help a lot.
