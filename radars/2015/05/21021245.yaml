Open the WebViewKeyboard project in XCode. (I used Xcode 6.2) and run it on the iPad simulator. Make sure the simulator keyboard is visible\r\n3. On the login page for username, enter a random string.\r\n4. For the password field, enter another random string and press the Return key.\r\n5. Once the 'Invalid' message is onscreen, press the password field again and observe that the keyboard is distorted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard should appear right, with all the keys expected to be the same size as the standard iOS keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard isn't appearing right on selecting the text field. The spacebar and the alphanumeric keys are out of shape.\r\nThe attached screenshot is an example of the distorted keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nKeyboard is incorrect.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Retina."
