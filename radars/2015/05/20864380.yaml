    description: "Summary:\r\nWith -Wunused-result, -Wreturn-type, and -Wunused-value passed into Other Warning Flags, I was not getting any warning for the following code: [@[@\"bacon\", @\"bakon\", @\"∆\"] sortedArrayUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(id obj1, id obj2) { return NSOrderedDescending; }];\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project\r\n2. Add -Wunused-result, -Wreturn-type, and -Wunused-value to your Other Warning Flags\r\n3. Throw '[@[@\"bacon\", @\"bakon\", @\"∆\"] sortedArrayUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(id obj1, id obj2) { return NSOrderedDescending; }];' somewhere in your code\r\n4. Build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a warning \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere was no warning\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3, Xcode Version 6.3.1 (6D1002), Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.49) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWouldn't have caught this if I didn't realize that I was sorting a non mutable array, I originally thought my sort was broken, took some time for me to realize that I wasn't saving the result of the sort. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nrMBP (Mid 2012)"
