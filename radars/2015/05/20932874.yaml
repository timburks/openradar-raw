        Summary:
        You should be able to set, on a per-app basis, whether the contents of a notification are shown automatically.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
        2. Choose “My Watch”, then “Notifications”.
        3. Scroll down to list of apps.
        4. Try to turn on Notification Privacy for a single app.

        Expected Results:
        There is a way to do this.

        Actual Results:
        There isn’t. You can turn an individual app’s notifications off entirely, and you can turn on Notification Privacy for all apps, but if there’s one trouble app, you’re out of luck.

        Notes:
        Most notifications on my phone have innocuous content, but for chat apps like Messages and Skype, I’d like to hide the contents of notifications unless I choose to see them. Apple Watch does not offer this option.

        (I seem to recall that Apple Watch isn’t supposed to show the contents if you just glance at the notification’s icon and turn the watch away, but in practice this doesn’t seem to work for me; the contents show whether I want them to or not. It’s possible that I just don’t know the proper motion to convince the watch I’m not interested.)
