    description: "Summary:\r\nSpotlight misses or ignores sparse bundles on OS X Yosemite [com.apple.disk-image-sparse-bundle].\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of OS X correctly indexed these and showed them in search results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Disk Utility and create a sparse bundle image file of any size.\r\n2. Use Spotlight to search for the sparse bundle\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect sparse bundles to appear in Spotlight search results so that I can quickly mount them.\r\n\r\nUse case scenario: I store sensitive documents that are synced with public cloud providers inside of an encrypted sparse bundle. A sparse bundle makes file syncing viable versus a sparse image which would not be suitable for encrypted syncing between devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy sparse bundles are no longer recognized by Spotlight and are not shown in search results. And yet, sparseimages do show up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe reason it's take so long to report this serious bug, and the reason it probably wasn't detected in the public betas is because any sparse bundles that were indexed by Spotlight before upgrading to Yosemite will continue to appear in Spotlight search results. This lead to behavior where the older existing sparse bundles would continue to show up, but not newer ones leading the user to believe that Spotlight just hadn't indexed the new ones yet.\r\n\r\nHowever, after a reinstall of OS X users pull out their hair because Spotlight no longer shows sparse bundles when it used to [and should continue].\r\n\r\n is that existing sparse bundles that were indexed prior to upgrading to Yosemite will still be shown in Spotlight results\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis issue is specific to OS X Yosemite. It worked perfectly in previous versions of Spotlight in 10.9 and prior.\r\n\r\ncom.apple.disk-image-sparse-bundle are not indexed and shown in results, but they _should_ be just like com.apple.disk-image-sparse.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
