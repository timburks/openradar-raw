    description: "Swipe actions are convenient. However, they are inconsistent.\r\n\r\nFor example, for iCloud, left swipe shows Trash and right swipe shows Archive, but for Gmail, left swipe shows Archive and right swipe shows Trash.\r\n\r\nIt forces me to think before swipe every time what account this mail is from, which is such a terrible user experience.\r\n\r\nSo please unify them and don't make me think. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple response:\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s your advance settings for gmail and icloud?  Specifically archive/delete setting\r\n\r\n\r\nMy response:\r\n\r\nI was using default settings. Under the default settings, Gmail and iCloud are opposite. Though I can dig into the very deep iCloud > Mail > Advanced settings and change MOVE DISCARDED MESSAGE INTO from Deleted Mailbox to Archive Mailbox to make iCloud behave the same as Gmail, I still think Mail app should unify the UI by default under the default settings because the advanced settings is so hard to find."
