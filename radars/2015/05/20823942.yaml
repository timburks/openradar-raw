        Summary:

        The Apple Watch complications for the calendar shows “NO MORE EVENTS” when there are no more events.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Live a simple life

        Expected Results:

        The complication should be blank.

        Actual Results:

        NO MORE EVENTS

        Regression:

        N/A

        Notes:

        The text is detrimental to usability. I have to read the text every time I look at the watch face to know that there are no more pending events. It would be much easier to interpret if the space was blank until there was actually something that required my attention.
