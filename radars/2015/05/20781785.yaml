    description: "Summary:\r\nRequesting for UIUserNotificationTypeSound permissions after relinquishing it once seems impossible. This prevents us from building an in-app settings toggle that allows the user to disable notification 'sounds' temporarily and enable them later.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Register for remote notifications in iOS 8 with 3 user notification settings: UIUserNotificationTypeSound | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge\r\n2) Press allow on the UIAlertView that comes up\r\n3) Check notification centre settings for your app, observe that toggle for 'Sounds' is ON.\r\n4) Register for remote notifications again with 2 permissions only this time: UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge\r\n5) Check notification centre settings for your app, observe that the toggle for 'Sounds' is now OFF.\r\n6) Register for remote notifications again with 3 permissions this time: UIUserNotificationTypeSound | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge\r\n7) Check notification centre settings for your app.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n'Sounds' toggle should turn ON after calling registerForRemoteNotifications again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n'Sounds' toggle remains OFF, no matter how many times you call registerForRemoteNotifications with the appropriate UIUserNotificationSettings."
