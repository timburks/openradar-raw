    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the three-finger-tap Quick Look gesture is used to preview a URL, the resulting pane cannot be zoomed (with the exception of double-two-finger-tapping to \"smart-zoom\", which still works).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure three-finger-tap and pinch-zoom gestures are enabled in System Preferences.app\r\n2. Open a webpage in Safari and hover over a link, or hover over a URL in any app (ie Messages.app)\r\n3. Tap with three fingers\r\n4. Hover over the resulting Quick-Look pane\r\n5. Attempt to zoom using the standard pinch-zoom gestures\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page should zoom in a normal manner, as pages in Safari do when pinch-zoomed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. Double-tapping with two fingers, however, behaves as expected (providing the gesture is enabled).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D136), Late-2013 Macbook Air 11\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue occurs on seemingly any configuration of OSX, as long as the relevant touchpad gestures are enabled. Have tested and reproduced this before and after a fresh install of OSX."
