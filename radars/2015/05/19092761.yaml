    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an affected Mac receives an S/MIME email signed by a certificate that chains to the \"COMODO RSA Certification Authority\" root certificate, that root certificate is added to the \"login\" Keychain. \r\n(This is because the \"COMODO RSA Certification Authority\" root certificate is still waiting to be accepted into the Apple Root Certificate Program).\r\nThen, when Safari browses to an HTTPS site whose certificate chain terminates with the trusted \"AddTrust External CA Root\" root certificate but which also includes the \"COMODO RSA Certification Authority\" CA, Safari selects the untrusted chain and displays a warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a signed email that is accompanied by a certificate chain that terminates with the \"COMODO RSA Certification Authority\" root certificate.\r\n2. Observe that the \"COMODO RSA Certification Authority\" root certificate has been added to the \"login\" Keychain.\r\n3. Browse to https://home.comparethemarket.com\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari should display the webpage at https://home.comparethemarket.com without showing any certificate warnings.  Then, after clicking the SSL padlock, the trusted certificate chain shown by safari_ok.tiff should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe browser warning shown by safari_warning.tiff is displayed.  Then, after clicking the SSL padlock, the untrusted certificate chain shown by safari_broken.tiff is displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWe didn't see this bug before last week, so we're guessing that it was introduced by OSX 10.10.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo obtain a free secure email certificate with which to reproduce this problem, go to: \r\nhttps://secure.comodo.com/products/frontpage?area=SecureEmailCertificate\r\n\r\nThis bug definitely occurs if the signed email is sent using Outlook on Windows.  (Other mail clients may attach a different certificate chain to the signed email, in which case this bug might not be triggered).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis bug doesn't occur with a default install of OS X.  But as soon as the \"COMODO RSA Certification Authority\" root certificate has been added to the \"login\" Keychain (which happens automatically when that root certificate is encountered in a signed email), the bug occurs consistently."
