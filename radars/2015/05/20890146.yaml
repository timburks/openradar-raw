        Summary:
        When opening a new tab and typing in part of a URL, but using the arrow keys to select an option that's not the first one, Safari sometimes chooses the first option instead of going with the user input.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a new tab in Safari
        2. Begin typing a URL of a page previously visited
        3. Use the arrow keys to select a displayed second option leading to a nested page on that site
        4. On hitting enter, Safari will sometimes jump back to the first option - which is usually the root domain of that page - and load that instead

        Expected Results:
        Safari goes with the user input and loads the site the user has selected with the arrow keys.

        Actual Results:
        Safari jumps back to the first result it has suggested and loads that.
