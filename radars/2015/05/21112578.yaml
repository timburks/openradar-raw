        Summary:
        I’m using Fabric (formerly known as Crashlytics) as a 3rd party tool to track crashes. I’ve received crashes coming from my WatchKit app extension, but these are not visible in Xcode. As seen in the attached screenshot, only the main app is visible in the list, and crashes from extensions are not included there.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Force a crash in an app extension.
        Check Xcode’s crashes list.

        Expected Results:
        The crash is displayed, either under the main app, or under a new item in the left column for the app extension.

        Actual Results:
        “This product does not have any crash information”

        Regression:
        This makes us developers have zero visibility as to what’s happening with our app extensions in the wild.
