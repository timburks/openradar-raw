    description: "Summary:\nDeleting a specific unused method in a framework that I import into a playground causes the playground execution to fail.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open PathMathPlay.workspace and select the playground. Note that it executes and a green cog is displayed.\n2. open CogIcon.swift and delete the method named bezierPath\n3. build\n4. select the playground again and trigger execution. \n\nExpected Results:\nThe same results as before the deletion of the method or failed compilation \n\nActual Results:\nNothing is rendered and an error is logged to console beginning with\nPlayground execution failed: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0xe).\n    * thread #1: tid = 0xdb91, 0x00007fff99cde061 libobjc.A.dylib`objc_retain + 17, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0xe)\n      * frame #0: 0x00007fff99cde061 libobjc.A.dylib`objc_retain + 17\n        frame #1: 0x000000010defd8b6 PathMath`protocol witness for PathMath.BezierPathType.addArcWithCenter <A : PathMath.BezierPathType>(inout PathMath.BezierPathType.Self)(C.CGPoint, radius : CoreGraphics.CGFloat, startAngle : CoreGraphics.CGFloat, endAngle : CoreGraphics.CGFloat, clockwise : Swift.Bool) -> () in conformance ObjectiveC.NSBezierPath : PathMath.BezierPathType in PathMath + 54 at BezierPath.swift:134 â€¦\n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
