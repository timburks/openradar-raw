        Summary:
        Application catalogs are great, for image asset management. However, they should do more. Perhaps manage all of the apps assets such as sounds, videos, colors, font, strings.

        In your application you should be able to load  assets with an asset manager class. (AssetManager.loadSound(id: soundID))
