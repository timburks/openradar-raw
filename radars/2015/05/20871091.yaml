    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a WKWebView containing a document with a contenteditable body element. If in JavaScript I attach a touchend listener to the element, then enter enough text to cause text to flow onto another line (there may be other reproduction steps but this consistently triggers it for me), upon tapping on the view (e.g. with the intention of performing text selection or to reposition the caret) the body loses focus and the scrollview scrolls so the location of my tap is centred in the view.\r\n\r\nThis may be related to the following WebKit issue, which sounds similar albeit in a different context: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136115\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap the body of the document so editing begins\r\n2. Enter enough text so the caret moves onto another line\r\n3. Tap and hold above the caret, say in the preceding paragraph\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe magnifying glass should appear, enabling caret positioning\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view scrolls so the location of the tap is centred\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://github.com/Bipsync/ios-wkwebview-touchend\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 / iOS Simulator"
