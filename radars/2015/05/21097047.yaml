    description: "Summary:\r\nThe seven activity rings at the top of the Activity app are partially cut off when on a phone call. The green bar appears when on a phone call, causing the UI of the Activity app to be compressed; unfortunately this causes the activity rings to be partially cut off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place a phone call.\r\n2. Open the Activity app and make sure it is displaying the Today activity summary (or any day).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI should be slightly compressed due to the active call bar on the top, but it should be compressed in a way that doesn't cut off part of the UI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActivity rings in top bar are cut off."
