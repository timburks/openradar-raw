    description: "Summary:\r\nNSHTTPURLResponse.localizedStringForStatusCode is returning descriptions of HTTP status code as specified in RFC2616 -- the HTTP/1.1 standard. That RFC, however, has been updated in 2012 to include several new status code in RFC6585. These codes are not being returned by the NSHTTPURLResponse API.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ncall `NSHTTPURLResponse.localizedStringForStatusCode` with a status code specified in RFC6585. For example, paste the following in a playground\r\n\r\nimport Foundation\r\nNSHTTPURLResponse.localizedStringForStatusCode(429)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe return value should be a text description that matches RFC6585, following the sample code, the result value should be\r\n\r\n\"too many requests\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value is a generic description of the error code. Following the sample code, it is\r\n\r\n\"client error\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nall\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFixing this issue should be relatively easy.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll occurrence of this API on any platform."
