        Summary:
        When running a test from within Xcode in one project, if you try to attach to debugger to another project, Xcode hangs.
        Ran into this on Xcode 6.3 and 6.4b3.

        I will attach the stack frame from running sample.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make a test project A with a test in it.
        2. Make a test project B.
        3. Run the test in project A.
        4. While the test in running, open the application for project B.
        5. Set a breakpoint in the test in project A so that it is paused in the debugger.
        6. With project B open, try attaching to the running project B process.

        Expected Results:
        At this point, you would expect Xcode to attach to the project.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode shows a spinning wheel and becomes unusable.

        Regression:
        In Xcode 6.1, this ran into a separate lldb issue but that has been resolved. This used to work in Xcode 5.

        Notes:
        No known workaround.
