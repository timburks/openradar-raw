    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Watch will show directions and tap when I need to turn even if my iPhone is actively displaying and speaking directions, and did not use my Watch to get those directions. I find this useless, a waste of power, and most importantly, distracting (at a time when distractions are dangerous). I don't see any way to change this behavior short of removing my watch while I'm driving.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get driving directions. It doesn't seem to matter how you initiate the process but I usually just use my phone to get directions since I need to have it out to display them.\r\n2. Start driving.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would not expect the Watch to actively give me directions while my phone is doing the same. It seems far more sensible to me to have the directions displayed on the device that initiated them. If I want those directions on a different device there should be some way to send them to that deviceâ€”perhaps just using Handoff.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy iPhone speaks and shows directions, while my Watch shows directions and taps my wrist. It's like having one person in the car telling me where to go while another person behind me is tapping on my shoulder and pointing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, Watch OS 1.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 AT&T, Apple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
