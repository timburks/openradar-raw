    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring development of our WatchKit app we discovered that in order to set pretty and localizable WatchKit app name in Apple Watch app on an iPhone we need to change CFBundleName property in Info.plist file of the host app target. Before that it was set to $(PRODUCT_NAME) value. This turned out to be problematic because changing CFBundleName also affects the default value of User-Agent header in all HTTP requests made from the app.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to change the User-Agent header because our backend servers and statistics depend on it. Also, we'd prefer not to set User-Agent header explicitly on each NSURLRequest, because it involves a lot of code changes and it can be error-prone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new WatchKit app project.\r\n2. Set CFBundleName key to some value.\r\n3. Add localized values for that key in strings file.\r\n4. Run the watch app on simulator or on device.\r\n5. Add any NSURLConnection HTTP request code to the host app target without explicitly setting User-Agent header value.\r\n6. Run the host app several times with different localization settings and sniff HTTP request using Charles or some similar app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser-Agent header does not depend on CFBundleName key of the host app and stays the same for all localization settings. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser-Agent header contains localized and url-encoded value from CFBundleName key.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3.1 (6D1002), iOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator"
