        Summary:
        When subclassing NSSegmentedControl (and NSSegmentedCell) to customize its appearance, there is no public way to get the auto-sized width of cells for which an explicit width has not been set. This makes it quite difficult to draw the segments correctly, matching the click targets NSSegmentedCell uses for them.

        NSSegmentedCell does have a private -rectForSegment:inFrame: method which works well, but as it is not public API, it shouldnâ€™t be used in shipping apps.

        It would be very helpful if this method was made public, or an alternative way of determining the rect or width of individual segments was exposed.
