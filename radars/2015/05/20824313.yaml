        Summary:
        The Apple Watch calendar complication has no way to hide events from less important calendars that appear on your iPhone.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Subscribe to your spouse’s iCloud calendar so you can see their appointments on your iPhone when needed.

        Expected Results:
        See your next event on your watch face in the Calendar complication.

        Actual Results:
        Half the time, see an event from your shared calendar that doesn’t apply to you.

        Notes:
        It would be useful either to hide a calendar, or to set it to only show events from a particular calendar. Any way to have a calendar appear on my iPhone but not on the watch face would make the calendar complication much more useful.
