        Summary:

        My wife is in London at the moment, so I wanted that city in the Apple Watch glance. By default, my local time zone was shown.

        I tried the following things:

        • Looking in Settings on the Apple Watch
        • Looking in the Apple Watch app
        • Changing the city in the World Clock app on the Apple Watch

        Frustrated, I turned to Twitter where one of the 20K people who follow me informed me that this is configured by adjusting the order of the list in the iOS Clock app:

        http://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/595257408777297920

        At a minimum, there should be some information about this side-effect in the My Watch > Clock section (which is one of the first places I looked at.)

        But this is an unsatisfactory solution because I work with people all over the world and keep my list of cities ordered by time zone. Moving London up above Los Angeles screws things up for me because I no longer see it between Berlin and Washington, D.C.

        Why doesn’t the glance just use the last city viewed in the app on the Apple Watch? This would be more obvious and easier to configure on an as-needed basis.
