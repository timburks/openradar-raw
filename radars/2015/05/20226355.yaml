    description: The navigational order of accessibility elements is being improperly calculated under certain conditions. I’ve found that setting a non-zero left inset on a WKInterfaceGroup (non-accessibility element) containing WKInterfaceLabel objects (accessibility elements) causes VoiceOver to regard the first accessibility element below the group with an x coordinate of 0 as positioned “before” the elements within the group, breaking the expectation that elements be read left to right, top to bottom.
