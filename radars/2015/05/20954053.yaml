    description: "Summary:\r\nSince Xcode unified the specification of a main storyboard or main nib file into a single \"Main Interface\" text field under the \"General\" tab of a project's settings, it is no longer possible through the General tab's UI to change either from a nib-based project to a storyboard-based project, or vice-versa. After changing the value of \"Main Interface\" to a suitable storyboard file name, one must then determine the need (perhaps after great psychological distress ;) ) and then manually edit the Info.plist entries to update NSMainNibFile or UIMainStoryboardFile to the appropriate value.\r\n\r\nIt may well be impossible to catch 100% of the cases of changing from nib to storyboard or vice-versa, but a nice nuance that would catch most cases would be:\r\n\r\n1. Pay attention to changes to \"Main Interface\"\r\n2. If the value changes to a file name that is not among the target's bundled resources, do nothing.\r\n3. If the value changes to a file name that IS among the target's bundled resources, deduce from the file's extension whether the Info.plist key for storyboard of nib file should be used, and set the exclusive value as expected.\r\n\r\nThus if you had a file called \"MainMenu.nib\" and a file called \"MainStoryboard.storyboard\", changing the name of \"Main Interface\" to \"MainStoryboard\" would ensure that the desired Info.plist key is set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.4 (6E14)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
