        Summary:

        When creating a new WatchKit extension, Xcode will automatically create them with the default deployment target 8.3. This is actually not supported, though: “WatchKit apps must have a deployment target equal to iOS 8.2”

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Create an iOS application project
        2. Add a WatchKit extension target
        3. Click “Build”

        Expected Results:

        The WatchKit extension should build with default settings.

        Actual Results:

        The WatchKit extension does not build, because “WatchKit apps must have a deployment target equal to iOS 8.2”

        Regression:

        Didn’t happen with Xcode 6.2, because 8.2 was the default deployment target there.
