    description: "Summary:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/Miscellaneous/RN-AdoptingStoryboards/\r\n\r\nSearch for \"Set the Main Storyboard for the Project\". The advice for setting the main storyboard file it out of date and reflects a previous version of Xcode in which there were two separate fields, one for Main Interface and one for Main Storyboard.\r\n\r\nThe advice is not valid and in fact a workaround such as described in Radar #20954053 is required to get the transition to work as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
