    description: "Summary:\n\nThereâ€™s currently no way (that I know of) to get notified when the status bar gets shown or hidden. UIApplication provides \nUIApplicationWillChangeStatusBarFrameNotification and UIApplicationDidChangeStatusBarFrameNotification, however those are only posted in response to orientation changes and during in-call status bar mode. They are not sent when the status bar gets shown or hidden.  \n\nExpected Results:\n\nNotifications like UIApplicationWillHideStatusBarNotification & UIApplicationDidHideStatusBarNotification or similar should be available. \n\nNotes:\n\nUIViewController based status bar appearance together with implementing layoutSubviews solves the problem in most cases, however in certain scenarios the mentioned notifications are still required (certain full screen interfaces or a floating view that overlays the navigation controller view like the PSPDFKit annotation toolbar)."
