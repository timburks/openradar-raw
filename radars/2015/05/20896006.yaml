        When calling NSNotification.addObserverForName(object:queue:usingBlock:), itâ€™s possible to pass nil as the queue object and have the notification run synchronously on the posting thread.

        If the queue parameter had a default value of nil, it would save having to explicitly specify a nil queue value, which is probably how most uses of the API are structured.
