    description: "Summary:\nOn a long playground, it was hard to figure out what was wrong with my use of someArray.filter { … }.map { … }\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nPut the following code in a playground:\n\nlet count = 3\n\nlet array = [\"a\", \"b\", \"abcdefg\"]\narray.filter { count($0) > 1 }.map { $0.uppercaseString }\n\nExpected Results:\nEither code fails to compile with an error pointing at `count` not being a function inside the filter closure, or the code compiles because it can infer that we’re referring to the Swift.count function, and not to the count variable defined above.\n\nActual Results:\nThe code fails to compile with an error that points at the wrong thing: \nPlayground execution failed: CountWrongErrorTestCase.playground:4:32: error: cannot invoke 'map' with an argument list of type '((_) -> _)'\narray.filter { count($0) > 1 }.map { $0.uppercaseString }\n                                          ^"
