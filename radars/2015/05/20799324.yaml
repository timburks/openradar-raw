    description: "Summary:\r\nThe voice language for Apple Maps navigation is always set to the device language. Siri allows for a custom language to be set, which is great for people like me who live in Germany and like to use Siri in German, but keep the device set to English. Navigation with German street names and an English speaking voice sounds ridiculous though, so a custom language setting here would be grand.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a route in Maps app\r\n2. Have the voice speak the steps in the device language\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA setting in the maps settings in Settings app to change the voice language would be what I'd be looking for.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA setting like that does not exist.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
