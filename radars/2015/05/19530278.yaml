    description: "ummary:\r\nYou allow users to opt-out improving Maps and you allow users to opt-out sending Diagnostic & Usage Reports, but there is no way to opt-out for improving Siri & Dictation Service. You store recorded speech for 6 months with a unique (yet random) identifier. Already that is too long IMHO, but that is not what I meant. After that you anonymize that data and keep around for up to two years altogether. You say that you do that for improving your service. That makes sense to me. You need test data when improving algorithms. So far that is okay, but why can't the user opt-out here? After all he can opt-out at all other places where you collect usage, diagnostic or other data to improve you service.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings\r\n2. Open General\r\n3. Open Siri\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA setting to opt-out improving Siri.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo setting to opt-out improving Siri."
