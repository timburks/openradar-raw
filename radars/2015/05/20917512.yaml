    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen displaying plain text mails (no HTML) in landscape mode, the font size is about 3-4 times bigger than when displaying in portrait mode. Instead of longer text lines the mail is now totally unreadable. Trying to get a smaller size by the Font Size setting in Settings has no effect either. As you can zoom mails (pinch), switching to landscape mode should no be a zoom operation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings app\r\n2. Choose Display & Brightness\r\n3. Choose Text Size\r\n4. Make text size as small as possible\r\n5. Open Mail app\r\n6. View a text only (non-HTML) mail\r\n7. Rotate iPhone to Landscape mode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFont size is about the same as in portrait, I just have more space now, so lines don't break that often.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFont size is huge compared to portrait (as huge as portrait with biggest font size in settings) and the mail is thus totally unreadable."
