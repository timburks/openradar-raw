        Summary:
        When editing an alarm’s repeat settings, Apple Watch should allow you to select or de-select all days.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch the Alarms app.
        2. Add an alarm.
        3. Tap “Repeat”.
        4. Force press.

        Expected Results:
        There are “select all” and “select none” buttons in the force press menu.

        Actual Results:
        There are no such buttons.

        Notes:
        This feature is missing from the iOS Clock app too, but at least there the list of days fits on the screen all at once.
