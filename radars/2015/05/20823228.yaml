    description: "Custom notification actions (UIMutableUserNotificationAction) have been a great addition to iOS. With the introduction of the Apple Watch and the increased importance of quick, relevant, and actionable notifications on all iOS devices, developers would benefit from a better way to present the user with custom notification actions. \r\n\r\nCurrently a developer has to define custom notification actions when registering UIUserNotificationSettings. Although it’s possible to change these after the initial registration, it’s not a flexible or granular system. The entire UIUserNotificationSettings object has to be recreated and re-registered with the UIApplication. This creates a lot of overhead when wanting to modify the action items associated with just one particular notification, and doesn’t allow for truly dynamic action items.\r\n\r\nRather than creating UIMutableUserNotificationActions in conjunction with a UIMutableUserNotificationCategory at time of registration, it would be preferable to have the option to push custom actions with each individual notification.\r\n\r\nMessaging apps provide a great example as to why this would be useful. Whatsapp might know that you often reply with just a smiley face when a specific friend messages you. That smiley face along with a few other contextual options should be available as quick reply interactive notifications.\r\n\r\nSetting these actions on-the-fly when the notification is created would more easily enable developers to provide their users with powerful, relevant actions they could perform from their lock screens and watches."
