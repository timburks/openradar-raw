        Summary:
        Sharing is everywhere but why can't I share an APP?

        As a user, I'd love to share an APP with a friend. Sharing links via email/twitter ("what's your email/id?") is not cutting edge anymore and far away from an instant experience: too many steps involved, too time consuming, too many drops, not fun at all.

        As a developer reducing the friction to spread my APPs is a major burden: some users rarely use the APP store, APP discovery is still an unsolved problem there. Who else than engaged users are the perfect promoters for an APP? Using their power to invite other users would help a lot.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - longpress an APP
        - all iOS devices/friends within reach appear "somewhere" (much like AirDrop)
        - dragging an APP to this "friend" directly opens the APP Store page of this respective APP as a modal dialog/alert (without switching to the APP Store APP)
        - if possible, the APP should be transferred locally from device to device, just the resigning/receipt validation should be handled by the APP Store (sharing events tend to have low out-/ingoing bandwidth but a good LAN or BT reach)

        Expected Results:
        - direct APP transfer without the onboarding hassles of link sharing
        - more user engagement both for the originator and the receiver

        Actual Results:
        - no APP sharing at all, only links to APPs
        - out-of-context APP installation
        - delayed, slow APP interaction
