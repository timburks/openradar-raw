    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd love to use Family Sharing, but the fact that it shares all book, songs and apps is driving me away from it. That is too coarse. And always explicitly hiding new items you don't want to share is cumbersome, also it hides those items from myself and to access them myself, I have to unhide, download and then re-hide them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Family Sharing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing is shared by default. Only items I explicitly enabled for sharing are shared and only for as long as I want them to be shared. Just like Calendars or Reminder Lists, that can be shared via iCloud, but only if I explicitly tell iCloud to share them and only with the people I want them to be shared (Adults != Children, Mother != Wife, etc.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEverything is shared by default and hiding items is extremely cumbersome.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacOS 10.10 / iOS 8"
