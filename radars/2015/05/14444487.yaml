    description: "I quote from the Daemons and Services Guide when talking about the XPC API: \"This API is only available for communication between an application and an XPC service inside its bundle.\"\r\n\r\nThis is factually wrong.\r\n\r\nOther information lead me to believe that this was wrong. I have implemented a LaunchAgent which lives outside the application bundle and have been able to communicate with it using XPC. Also the method initWithMachServiceName for an NSXPCConnection also demonstrates that the Daemons and Services Guide is wrong.\r\n\r\nI believe that there are other examples in that documentation in relation to LaunchAgents and its interaction with XPC that are wrong. There may also be issues relating to LoginItems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Read Daemons and Services Guide documentation.\r\n2. Be confused.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Read documentation\r\n2. Not be confused by conflicting information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nConfusion\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would also like to see TN2083 updated to match with changes to creating LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons and LoginItems."
