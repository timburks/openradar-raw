        Summary:
        An instance method on a Swift class, that does NOT inherit from NSObject can be called from Objective-C like a class method. It does compile, even though it should not. It crashes at runtime which is pretty dangerous.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * Example Project: https://github.com/fabb/MissingCompileError.git
        * Compiles fine, but crashes at runtime

        Expected Results:
        Should not compile.

        Actual Results:
        Compiles but crashes at runtime.
