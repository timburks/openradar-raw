        When I use "Open Quickly" and type "ELGB" to quickly get ELGButtonCell, then press the down arrow a few times to select the entry, Xcode will always suddenly re-order the list entries and reset the selection to the first line in the list right before I hit the return key to actually open the file, causing me to end up with the wrong one.

        (See attached screen recording)

        If you absolutely can't make Xcode *not* re-order the list suddenly, could you please at least notice when someone has changed the selection (using mouse or arrow keys) and in that case keep the same item selected? Thanks!
