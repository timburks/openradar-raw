    description: "Summary:\r\n-[NSAttributedString initWithData:options:documentAttributes:error] is slow and can only be used on the main thread. This should work on any thread.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached example project that shows the slowness and the possible crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Fast conversion of a HTML string to a NSAttributedString\r\n2. Usable from every thread\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. VERY slow\r\n2. Can crash in a background thread (because WebKit)\n\nNotes:\nTo be fair, I didnâ€™t managed to build a sample that crashes, these crashers are random and are easier to happen in a larger application where more stuff is going on with different html pages being parsed at the same time."
