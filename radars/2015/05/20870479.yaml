        Summary:

        Apps frequently need to provide For-Your-Information messages to users. In these situations, UIAlertViews are overkill, especially when there are several messages following on from one another resulting in a pop-up storm, which is poor UX. The pop-up storm you get when connecting a new device to Messages.app is a classic example of this.

        We need both an API and acceptable UX to handle this scenarios. Another generic mobile OS does it with “toasts”, but these aren’t ideal because they sometimes end up obscuring the UI. Some apps handle this using alert banners than slide in below the UINavigationBar, but this frequently obscures other UI elements.

        One option might be for these messages to temporarily scroll over the iOS status bar.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Review iOS API documentation and human interface guidelines and observe there is no good solution to this problem.

        Expected Results:

        An available API and good UX for handling FYI-type messages.

        Actual Results:

        No API. Lots of apps doing it their own way. Badly.

        Regression:

        N/A
