    description: "Summary:\r\nThis happens with tons of examples, but here's the one I reproduced most recently: Set two context menu items, one with the title \"Einkaufen einschalten\" and the other with \"Auf den Wunschzettel\". Every time other time you do a Force Touch, the text is resized to fit perfectly, and on the alternate time, the text is truncated. See attached images.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set two context menu items, one with the title \"Einkaufen einschalten\" and the other with \"Auf den Wunschzettel\"\r\n2. Do a Force Touch. The text will either be resized to fit perfectly or be truncated\r\n3. Get out of the context menu\r\n4. Do another Force Touch. If the text was resized last time it will fit perfectly; if it fit perfectly last time it will be truncated\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text should either fit perfectly every time or be truncated every time (ideally fit every time)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text alternates between fitting perfectly and getting truncated\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2, app built with Xcode 6.2 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Sport 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_1823.png' and 'IMG_1824.png' were successfully uploaded."
