    description: "Summary:\r\nFor images in iCloud and not downloaded yet, PHAsset.pixelWidth & pixelHeight gives a size much smaller than the full image’s size if it is downloaded. It seems to be the size of a thumbnail version of the image which is useless as a meta data.\r\n\r\nI’m using traditional iCloud stream and none of my devices turn on iCloud Photo Library. I’m not sure whether this bug also exists in that environment. Please test in a similar environment to mine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Grant permission.\r\n3. Relaunch sample app.\r\n4. Read console logs: (album, index, width, height)\r\n5. Find an image and open it in Photo.app using album name and index. Let the download finish. It’s easy to tell that the full image is much larger than the reported size from PHAsset.\r\n6. Relaunch sample app.\r\n7. Find the just downloaded image using album name and index in console logs. See that the reported size is now correct.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPHAsset.pixelWidth & pixelHeight should give the size of full image even if the full image is not downloaded yet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPHAsset.pixelWidth & pixelHeight gives the size of a thumbnail version of the image if the full image is not downloaded yet.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/2g02083G0W3O"
