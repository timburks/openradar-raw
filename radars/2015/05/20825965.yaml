        Summary:
        UICollectionViewFlowLayout's last row is left-aligned by default if items have a non-uniform height, when many use cases would expect a justified positioning. This can be customized using private API, but is not public.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open example. Observe this: http://cl.ly/image/0F3f2P453X2W
        Expected/Wanted: http://cl.ly/image/2K330W304021

        Expected Results:
        Last line layout should be justified.

        Actual Results:
        Last line layout is not justified.

        Regression:
        This is the case since iOS 6.

        Notes:
        I discovered this back then when I wrote PSTCollectionView. A horrible, private API workaround is this:

            NSMutableDictionary *rowAlignmentOptions = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:[flowLayout valueForKey:@"rowAlignmentOptions"]];
            rowAlignmentOptions[@"UIFlowLayoutLastRowHorizontalAlignmentKey"] = rowAlignmentOptions[@"UIFlowLayoutCommonRowHorizontalAlignmentKey"];
            flowLayout setValue:rowAlignmentOptions forKey:@"rowAlignmentsOptions"];

        Itâ€™s unexpected that lay-outing changes as soon as one size has a non-uniform height, which I assume has to do with an internal optimization that calculates the frames faster for uniform-sized elements.
