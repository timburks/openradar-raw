    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the right combination of layout and text, WatchKit seems to miscalculate the height of a notification. The bottom of the notification gets cut off, resulting in a missing word and square corners.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app on an iPhone and allow notifications.\r\n2. Run the Apple Watch app on a 42mm watch. It will ask the parent app to display a local notification.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification text should read:\r\nItem name\r\nPreparing to ship\r\nDelivered by Tuesday\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification text reads:\r\nItem name\r\nPreparing to ship\r\nDelivered by\r\n\r\n(The word Tuesday does not appear, and the box around the text is square at the bottom instead of rounded)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA screenshot is also included in the attachment showing the problem.\r\n\r\nIf the last line is \"Delivered by Monday\" or \"Delivered by Thursday\" everything displays correctly. With \"Monday\" it all fits on one line. With \"Thursday\" it correctly adds another line of text.\r\n\r\nI can't seem to find a good workaround for the problem. Adjusting the layout might get \"Delivered by Tuesday\" to display correctly but based on my testing that just means some other text is going to get cut off.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, Apple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WatchLabel.zip' was successfully uploaded."
