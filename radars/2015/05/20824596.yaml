    description: "Summary:\r\nImporting fixed-length C array as tuple makes it very hard to use. More specifically, because tuple does not support direct length access and iteration, the code to use such tuple-array is very unsafe and ugly:\r\n                let count = sizeofValue(cArray) / sizeofValue(cArray.0)\r\n                withUnsafePointer(&cArray.0) { (p) -> Void in\r\n                    for var i = 0; i < count; ++i {\r\n                         // code using p[i]\r\n                    }\r\n                }"
