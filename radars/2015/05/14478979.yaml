    description: "Tech note 2083 is out of date, but is still essential reading for developing LaunchAgents, and LaunchDaemons etc. Because it is out of date, it is not always clear which bits are still current and which aren't when developing launch agents and daemons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRead TN 2083 and other documentation relating to launch agents and launch daemons.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNot to be confused because some documentation is less out of date than other documentation and as a result there is conflicting information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nConfusion and time wasted because time is spent trying to work out what information should be ignored because it is no longer correct. This is especially so for someone who is new to developing these sorts of tools."
