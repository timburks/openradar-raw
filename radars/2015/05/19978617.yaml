    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter loading a new build on watch and launching glance the snapshot view of the glance first appears. The activity indicator is shown as the new glance is loaded however it first shows the Interface Builder glance view before it loads the new glance view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install and run watch app and launch glance.\r\n2. Make a new build and deploy to watch\r\n3. Launch glance\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe snapshot of the previous viewed glance to appear followed by the activity indicator whilst loading the new/updated glance as part of the new build. With the \"Hides When Loading\" function it would not show the Interface Builder glance view but remain with the snapshot view of the glance previously captured and once the new glance has been loaded it will display that. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe snapshot glance view is first displayed followed by the the activity indicator (with time stamp) displayed. After a few seconds the Interface Builder view of the glance is displayed for a second before the updated glance is then displayed."
