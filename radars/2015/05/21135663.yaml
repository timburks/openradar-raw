    description: "If a custom popover background is set (via UIPopoverController's backgroundColor property), that color is overridden (returned to the default UIPopoverController background color) when the content size of the view in the UIPopover changes size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode.\r\n2. Load the attached project file.\r\n3. Build and run.\r\n4. In the built app, click the gear icon on the right-hand side of the toolbar on the top of the view. \r\n-- Observe: The resulting UIPopover's background color is red. This is expected: ViewController.swift has overridden prepareForSegue: and set the popover background color to red.\r\n5. In the popover, click the Next button.\r\n-- Observe: The UIPopover's background color is no longer red, it has changed back to the default color (not expected).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCustom-set UIPopover background color should remain that color even when the popover changes size or location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCustom-set UIPopover background color changes back to default color when the popover changes size or location.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.3 (12F69)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote: This only appears to occur when the popover is close to the right-hand side of the screen. If the gear button in the sample app is moved to the left a bit (via Fixed Space item, say), the issue doesn't occur.\r\n\r\nNote: This also occurs (the color changing back to default) if the popover is moved or repositioned as a result of orientation change. So, after step 4, above, rotating the device will also trigger the behavior.\r\n\r\nNote: Side note, when the popover is invoked in the enclosed sample app, the popover appears to be too far to the right - the arrow doesn't quite line up with the bar button item from which it is presented.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 4 64GB Verizon\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PopoverColorTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
