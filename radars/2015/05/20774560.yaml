    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the rapid growth of iOS, many enterprises now support iTunes in their desktop environment. Similarly, workers often request the iCloud for Windows plugin as a bridge between their work and personal lives.   This is fine and good, except that it remains extremely difficult to manage patching of Apple software (QuickTime, iTunes, Bonjour, iCloud) in a coordinated manner.  \r\n\r\nPatch management systems (IBM Endpoint Manager, Dell KACE, LANDesk, Altiris, etc) all attempt to aid in patching of Apple software on Windows, but it's problematic in all cases.\r\n\r\nThis situation would be greatly improved if Apple Software Update had a command line equivalent, similar to softwareupdate on OS X.  Whether that implementation might be a standard command shell binary, or special hooks available in the PowerShell environment is less of a consideration.\r\n\r\nPlease add command line support to Apple Software Update on Windows.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.1.3.127\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a duplicate of 7772916, filed in March 2010."
