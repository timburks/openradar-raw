        Summary:
        The Counterparts assistant editor has gotten less and less reliable over the last year. In the latest release of Xcode, it now almost never works. The assistant editor menu (https://www.dropbox.com/s/5rhgcby1s7fnzo6/Screen%20Shot%202015-05-06%20at%2012.43.10%20PM.png?dl=0) is often missing entirely and set to manual mode. Switching between various files will eventually bring it back.

        I have experienced this issue across multiple projects. At first I thought it might be an issue with Swift, since it usually doesnâ€™t have any counterpart files, but have been seeing it in pure ObjC projects as well.
