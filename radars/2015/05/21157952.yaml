    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen filling in contact info, the \"add address\" field should include a button that will auto fill my current location.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a new contact (either someone setting up their own info for Siri, or the info of a friend).\r\nAdd an address to that contact.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contacts form will allow you to auto fill your correct location, saving you the time of entering it all manually.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to find out your correct locations address and enter the entire thing everytime, even if you are standing at the address you wish to input.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA better \"design\" for this feature than a button would likely be the 'placeholder' text which currently reads\r\n\"Street\r\nStreet\r\nTown/City\r\n...\"\r\n\r\nto update and then change (animated) into the values for your correct location.\r\n\r\nThis would still allow you to override them easily as placeholder text disappears the instant you tap on the text field.\r\nIf this was implemented though each text field should be treated separately though, so that tapping on the top street address to correct a house number did not automatically remove the entire auto filled address.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
