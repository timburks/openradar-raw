    description: "Summary:\nThe new crash reporting UI introduced in Xcode 6.3 includes crashes coming from raised NSExceptions (as shown in attached screenshot). However, nowhere in that UI is the exception message included, which makes debugging crashes an impossible task.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nForce a crash from an exception:\n\nNSException *exception = [NSException\n        exceptionWithName:@“TestException”\n        reason:@“This is a test exception. My message won’t be displayed in Xcode :(”\n        userInfo:nil];\n@throw exception;\n\nExpected Results:\nThe message “This is a test exception. My message won’t be displayed in Xcode :(“ is included along with the crash report in Xcode’s organizer. \n\nActual Results:\nOnly the stack trace is visible.\n\nRegression:\nNot only is this a problem for exceptions thrown, but also any exception thrown by NSAssertion macros!"
