    description: "Summary:\r\n-[NSAttributedString initWithData:options:documentAttributes:error] is slow and can crash if used in a background thread\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached example project that shows the slowness and the possible crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Fast conversion of a HTML string to a NSAttributedString\r\n2. Usable from every thread\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. VERY slow\r\n2. Can crash in a background thread (because WebKit)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has caused crashes, though this sample code doesn't seem to be producing them. In our proper app we were more likely to get crashes when trying to parse the html in app did finish launching, still unsure of why.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 5s and 6 running iOS 8.3"
