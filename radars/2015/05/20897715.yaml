    description: "Summary:\r\nI manage an iPad 1:1 program for grades 9-12. When I install a configuration profile where \"Allow installing apps\" is unchecked (since we only allow school approved apps), it is also changing the way Safari Cookies are handled by improperly setting them to \"From Visited Sites\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create and push a configuration profile where \"Allow installing apps\" is unchecked but \"Accept Cookies\" is set to \"Always\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes & App Store disappears, nothing else is changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes & App Store disappears, but Settings -> Safari -> Block Cookies has been set to \"Allow from Current Website Only\" and the option we want (\"Allow from Websites I Visit\") is grayed out.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 4th Generation (Wi-Fi), JAMF Casper 9.65"
