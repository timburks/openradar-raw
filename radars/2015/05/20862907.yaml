    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an iMessage conversation between user A and user B has user A’s phone number as the address, and user A’s phone number changes—for example, after a SIM card swap when traveling internationally—user A sends a message to that conversation, the message will transparently be sent from user A’s new phone number, even if user A has selected an email address in iMessage’s “start new conversations from” setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. User A has a phone number and email address configured for receiving iMessages.\r\n2. User A chooses their email address in “start new conversations from” in Settings > Messages > Send & Receive\r\n3. User B sends an iMessage to User A’s phone number\r\n4. User A changes their SIM card, and receives a new phone number\r\n5. User A replies to the iMessage from User B\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser A’s reply is sent from their default “start new conversations from” address, their email address, because the phone number is no longer available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser A’s reply is sent from their new phone number, and User B is more likely to confused by receiving an iMessage from an unknown phone number.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
