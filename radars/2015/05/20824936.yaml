    description: "If I have a Calendar account (e.g. Gmail), I can prevent certain calendars from appearing in my iPhone calendar app by deselecting them. This is nice because it hides certain calendars that have all-day events (e.g. support roster). There is no way to mirror this setting on the Watch, making the calendar complication effectively useless, because it always shows the all-day event.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a calendar that has a bunch of all-day events, call it \"All Day Cal\"\r\n2. Hide that calendar on your iPhone by going to the Calendar app, selecting Calendars, then deselecting All Day Cal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. By default, Apple Watch should mirror the iPhone settings and events from that calendar should not appear on the Watch.\r\n2. Optionally, I can use the Watch app on my iPhone to customise the calendars displayed on Watch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll calendars always appear on Apple Watch. There is no way to hide calendars from the Watch"
