    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iTunes Connect has a service outage, it is rarely reported on the Apple system-status page https://developer.apple.com/system-status/ and when it is, this is often only after significant delay.\r\n\r\nEg. there is currently (7 May 2015, 21:22 GMT) a significant outage that has been widely commented on on Twitter (including numerous reports directed to @apple), but the system status page claims no reported issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wait for iTunes Connect to experience an outage\r\n2. Check https://developer.apple.com/system-status/ to learn details about the outage\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the page to contain accurate information about the current system status.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page does not contain accurate information about the current system status.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
