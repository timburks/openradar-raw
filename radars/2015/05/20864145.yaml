    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile an iPhone app is updating from the App Store and you try to run its Watch app, the Watch app becomes unlaunchable (see screenshots). The only workaround seems to be restarting your iPhone or deleting and reinstalling the iPhone app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a version, say 1.0, of an iPhone app with a WatchKit Extension\r\n2. Update it to Version 1.1 via the App Store\r\n3. While it is installing on your iPhone, try to launch the Watch app.\r\n4. The Watch app attempts to launch but just spins endlessly. The only workaround is to reboot your iPhone or delete the iPhone app and reinstall\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to launch a Watch app when it is not actively installing, i.e. the Watch app icon looks totally normally and there is no loading indicator overlayed on the icon\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Watch app becomes unusable when the iPhone app is updating with nothing displayed on the Watch app icon indicating that it can't be used. The Watch app is launched into an unusable state until the iPhone is rebooted or the app is deleted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, Watch OS 1.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, Apple Watch Sport 38mm"
