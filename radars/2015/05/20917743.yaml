    description: "Summary:\r\nFor text mails (not HTML) it would be great if you could allow to customize what display font is being used (e.g. whether it is a fixed with or proportional one and the font size) - just like you can do at Mail for OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings\r\n2. Go to Mail settings\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can select font type and size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such setting exists, only Font Size for all apps, but I don't want to change font size for all apps, only for my mails."
