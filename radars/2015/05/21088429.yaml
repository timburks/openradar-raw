        Summary:
        It can be difficult, especially on a scaled retina screen with a black background, to see the insertion cursor when editing source code in Xcode. I would like to see an option that would highlight the background of whichever line the insertion cursor is currently in, similar to the highlights shown for errors, warnings, breakpoints, etc. That would make it much easier to track the cursor as you're moving it around with the arrow keys.
