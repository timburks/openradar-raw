        Summary:
        When building an iOS app with the deployment target set to iOS 7.0 containing a device specific .xib, the compiled nib in the app bundle gets a wrong name.

        E.g the expected filename in the app bundle for the attached example project should be MyNib~iphone.nib, but it actually is MyNib~iphone~iphone.nib

        This leads unexpected behavior as the object in the xib can not be instantiated using
        UINib(nibName: "MyNib", bundle: nil).instantiateWithOwner(nil, options: nil)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the example project

        Expected Results:
        No crash

        Actual Results:
        Crash

        NibCrash[9164:2665901] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Could not load NIB in bundle: 'NSBundle </private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/DD875712-11A6-462F-9B81-63619173C44F/NibCrash.app> (loaded)' with name 'MyNib''

        Regression:
        This is a regression from Xcode 6.3.0
