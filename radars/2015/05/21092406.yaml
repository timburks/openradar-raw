        Summary:
        Right now, when using the "Size" inspector to view constraints attached to a view in Interface Builder, the constraints are displayed in an arbitrary order, usually the order in which they were added to the document. It would be helpful to separate the horizontal constraints into a separate section from the vertical ones. Since you're usually troubleshooting one axis or the other at any given time, having the vertical and horizontal mixed together makes it hard to narrow in on the constraints you want to look at.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a .xib file in Xcode and select a view with some attached constraints
        2. Select View > Utilities > Show Size Inspector to show the size inspector for the view.
        3. Look at the "Constraints" section in the inspector sidebar

        Expected Results:
        I would like to see two subsections, horizontal and vertical, with the view's constraints separated by their axis.

        Actual Results:
        The constraints are shown in a single group, with horizontal and vertical mixed together.
