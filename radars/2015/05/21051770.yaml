    description: "When I add a new shortcut on my iPhone, the shortcut won't immediately sync to other devices, and I have no idea when will it sync. It will show up someday or it won't sync at all.\r\n\r\nSecondly, whenever I modify/delete a shortcut from my iPhone, the shortcut gets modified/deleted from my iPhone. However, days later, the unmodified/deleted shortcut will mysteriously show up again on the Keyboard Shortcut lists. As a result, the shortcuts are duplicated.\r\n\r\nTrying to delete all and start over will not work either, because even though I cleared all the shortcuts, few days later all the deleted shortcuts will shown up again in Keyboard Shortcut lists. In other words, there is just no way to modify/delete shortcuts from the list other than just add new shortcut.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Settings > General > Keyboards > Shortcuts\r\n2. Tap \"+\" sign to add new shortcut\r\n3. Tap \"Edit\" to modify/delete shortcut\r\n4. Changes won't sync over to other devices (iOS Devices and Macs)\r\n5. Deleted/Unmodified shortcut reappear in shortcut list days later\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Settings > General > Keyboards > Shortcuts\r\n2. Tap \"+\" sign to add new shortcut\r\n3. Tap \"Edit\" to modify/delete shortcut\r\n4. Changes sync over to other devices via iCloud (iOS Devices and Macs)"
