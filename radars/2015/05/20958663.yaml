    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UISearchController inside an UISplitViewController, state seems to break when the master sheet of the split screen controller is dismissed - if it is in overlay mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached example. Follow what I’m doing in the gif: http://cl.ly/image/1S413o1P090K\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch should either disable itself when the parent view controller disappears, or simply stay active when we get visible again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearch controller breaks, search bar gets inaccessible, view appearance methods are no longer forwarded… at this stage the VC state seems broken internally.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked with UISearchDisplayController, even when that one has it’s fair share of other problems.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso running a DTS on this, but since it doesn’t look promising I’m filing a radar as well."
