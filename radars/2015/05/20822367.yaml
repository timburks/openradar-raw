    description: "Summary:\r\nAccording to <view-source:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH2-SW6>, accessing [UIApplication sharedApplication] and any of UIApplication's associated methods — including notifications — is not available in the context of an app extension's sandboxed process.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 8.3, a document provider utilizing an instance of LAContext (and calling its evaluatePolicy method) triggers an applicationDidBecomeActive notification. This should not technically not be permissible, according to the docs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReproducible 100% of the time.\r\n\r\n1. Instantiate an app with Document Provider app extension\r\n2. Turn on Touch ID authentication when application does become active\r\n3. Add observer for UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification notification in the app delegate\r\n4. Open another 3rd-party app that allows browsing/viewing files using original app's document provider\r\n5. Open document provider in 3rd-party app that supports extension\r\n6. Observe how when the app extension process is used, UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification's callback is triggered in the app extension's context\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification — or any UIApplication related methods and constants — should not be triggered in the context of an app extension.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification getting triggered in the context of an app extension's process.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 64GB, Verizon using Wi-Fi"
