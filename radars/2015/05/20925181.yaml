        Summary:
        While Xcode combines the contents of multiple lines beginning with /// into a single block of documentation, it does not insert whitespace into them, at least in Objective-C.  (In a Playground, whitespace is inserted between the lines.)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new project (command line tool is simplest).
        2. Declare a function and put two triple-slash comments above it (e.g., “///first” and “///second”).
        3. Option-click on the function name to display the in-line documentation.
        4. Observe that the two lines are concatenated without any space between them (e.g., “firstsecond”).

        Expected Results:
        Whitespace (specifically, at least one space character) is inserted between the concatenated lines (e.g., “first second”).

        Actual Results:
        The lines are concatenated without any space between (e.g., “firstsecond”).

        Regression:
        Occurs in OS X command line tool project with Objective-C file.  Does not occur in Playground.
