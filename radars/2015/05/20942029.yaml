    description: "Summary:\r\nOur designers gave us an Illustrator file with sRGB as the working profile. When I enter the RGB values in the IB color picker and ensure that sRGB is selected, the incorrect color is displayed. I am able to work around this by manually selecting Generic RGB as the profile when entering a color profile, however, this takes 2-3 times as long to perform as the color profile and color picker part of Xcode is buggy and doesn't always keep the values you give it.\r\n\r\nTo me, if I'm given an sRGB value and enter that with the sRGB profile selected in IB, that should display the correct color\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo get incorrect color\r\n1. Retrieve #161616/R22G22B22 from the sRGB Illustrator file\r\n2. Select a UIView and open the color picker for its background\r\n3. Ensure sRGB is the color profile selected\r\n4. Enter R22 G22 B22 and click Enter without entering the hex field (to avoid that bug, although repeating this by entering #161616 also produces same result)\r\n5. Run the app in simulator or on a device.\r\n6. R17G17B17 is what is actually displayed on both the simulator and device (which you can see by taking a screenshot then color picking)\r\n\r\nWorkaround for correct color, although not long-term solution\r\n1. Retrieve #161616/R22G22B22 from the sRGB Illustrator file\r\n2. Select a UIView and open the color picker for its background\r\n3. With the cursor in one of the RGB fields, not the hex field, select Generic RGB as the color profile\r\n4. Enter R22 G22 B22 and click Enter without entering the hex field (to avoid that bug where the profile reverts to sRGB when entering the hex field)\r\n5. Run the app in simulator or on a device.\r\n6. The correct color is shown"
