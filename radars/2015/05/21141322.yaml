    description: "Summary:\r\nA customer has a Mac server that goes to sleep every morning around 11:00 AM, even though all Energy Saver sleep settings are set to \"Never\". While looking at the system log to determine why, we found this log message:\r\n\r\nMay 26 11:03:03 SERVERNAME kernel[0]: Previous sleep cause: 5\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, \"5\" is not documented anywhere. Nor, apparently, are any of the other possible sleep causes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnable to reproduce on other systems.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSystem log should have a human-readable message like \"Previous sleep caused by 90 minutes of inactivity\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Previous sleep cause: 5\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 14D131\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126588/are-os-x-shutdown-cause-and-sleep-cause-numbers-listed-explained-anywhere for related questions by other users.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
