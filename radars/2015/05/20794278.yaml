        Summary:

        When creating a new WatchKit extension in a project, it is also possible to select OS X targets for embedding it.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Create an Xcode project with both iOS and OS X targets
        2. Create a new WatchKit extension

        Expected Results:

        OS X targets are disabled for embedding the new WatchKit extension.

        Actual Results:

        OS X targets are selectable and Xcode follows through with embedding the WatchKit extension into it, without any indication that this will break both the OS X target, as well as the WatchKit targets.

        The issue can be seen in action in this commit: https://github.com/neonichu/XcodeRemote/commit/a44fa761b08fbe97cdd7fa2e9b21cc528b02f491
