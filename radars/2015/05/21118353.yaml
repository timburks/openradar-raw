    description: "When presenting a view controller modally with the presentation mode Form Sheet, a UISegmentedControl within that view controller will not change tint color if a application wide tint color has been set. In that case the segmented control will have the application wide tint color instead of the tint color set for the segmented control either in storyboard or even in code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet a application wide tint color: \r\n  window?.tintColor = UIColor.redColor()\r\nPresent a view controller that has a segmented control modally with presentation mode Form Sheet\r\nThen set the tintColor of the presented view controller to another color:\r\n  segmentedControl.tintColor = UIColor.blueColor()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe segmented control with a blue tint color\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe segmented control with a red tint color"
