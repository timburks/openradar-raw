    description: "Summary:\r\nRecently, my iPhone was replaced and restored through iCloud backup. When I tethered my new iPhone (via Bluetooth) to my computer, a new instance of the phone appeared in the Bluetooth menu extra. There was no obvious or logical way to remove this old entry in the menu, since tethered phones don't appear in the Bluetooth preference pane or in the in the Network preference pane (just a general \"iPhone USB\" entry exists there).\r\n\r\nI only found out how to remove it (by holding down option) when I stumbled upon this StackExchange answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/168697\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tether iPhone to computer using Bluetooth\r\n2. Get a new iPhone and restore from iCloud backup of previous phone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTethered devices appear in the Bluetooth preference pane and there is an obvious way to remove the previously-tetherd device from the bluetooth menu extra.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe process of removing a previously-tethered device from the menu extra is confusing and non-obvious.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
