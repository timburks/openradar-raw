    description: "Summary:\r\nThe array returned by -[UICollectionView indexPathsForVisibleItems] is not sorted, but the documentation does not mention this. Duplicate of, or related to, rdar://problem/13417031\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Call -[UICollectionView indexPathsForVisibleItems] in an app, expecting the results to be sorted, because the return type is ordered (NSArray instead of NSSet), and the documentation does not say anything about it not returning a sorted array.\r\n2. Assume that the contents of the array you get back will be sorted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour assumption that the array is sorted is correct, and your code works.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYour assumption that the array is sorted is incorrect, and your code behaves strangely until you realize that the array is not sorted. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI think I understand why this array returns an unsorted list: many uses of this API do not require a sorted list, so sorting it would just be a waste of cycles. However, it would be nice if it were documented that this method returns a not-necessarily-sorted collection of index paths. Alternatively, the method could return an NSSet, which does not suffer from implied sort order syndrome."
