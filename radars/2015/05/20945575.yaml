    description: "Summary:\r\nMy WatchKit app was invalidated after I took a photo that saved to the photo library from within my companion app.\r\n\r\nThe effect is that when I then raise my wrist again, I'm back at the app launcher for the app.\r\n\r\nThe original issue I could reproduce 100% of the time, though the code to save a photo was not well optimized for memory efficient image manipulation. This resulted in memory warnings being generated and leads me to believe that this issue is related to memory pressure.\r\n\r\nHowever, after sufficiently optimizing this code and remedying the companion app of memory warnings during this process, I can still manage to reproduce this issue about 10 - 15% of the time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Settings on the Watch, enabled Resume to Last Used App.\r\n2. Start the Watch app\r\n3. Lower your wrist to put the screen to sleep.\r\n4. Open the companion app and snap a photo that then saves to the photo library.\r\n5. Raise your wrist and observe that the Watch app has been invalidated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Watch app should resume where it left off when I raise my wrist.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Watch app appears to have crashed. After inspecting device logs, it appears to have been invalidated. See attached log.\r\n\r\ncompanionappd[10832] <Warning>: plugin com.*****.watchkitextension invalidated\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, Watch OS 1.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus, Apple Watch\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'invalidated.rtf' was successfully uploaded."
