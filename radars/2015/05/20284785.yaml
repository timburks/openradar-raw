    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have created a build bot that is scheduled to run \"on commit\". Whenever someone commits code to git, the build bot ends up queueing 2 new integrations for the same exact commit. \r\n\r\nI think this can easily be fixed by checking the git commit number to make sure you don't already have a build bot integration for that exact same git commit number.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup build bot that runs \"on commit\".\r\n2. Commit changes to git.\r\n3. The build bot will often create duplicate integrations of the exact same commit.\r\nNOTE: I'd say this happens > 50% of the time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly one integration is created per git commit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild bot often creates 2 integrations for the same exact git commit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nClient: Xcode 6.2 (6C131e)\r\nServer: Xcode 6.2 (6C131e)"
