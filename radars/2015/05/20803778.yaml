    description: "David Klionsky04-May-2015 03:03 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen iOS 8.3 was released a new crash started appearing in our live app. Based on the crash logs, the crash is happening in internal iOS code and is related to layout when presenting a UIAlertController.\r\n\r\nSince this error appeared after an iOS update and the crash logs do not show our application code, we believe this is an iOS bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Duolingo while logged out.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app launches normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash occurs sometimes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'c9c4a761be94618cd71e1ca73bb67928.log.txt' was successfully uploaded."
