        Summary:
        When presenting a modal controller in WatchKit, there does not appear to be a way to localize the cancel button. See the attached screenshot for an example where the device settings are set to Japanese, but Cancel is displayed in English.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - place the device in a non-english language setting
        - present a view controller modally, such as with WKInterfaceControllerâ€™s presentControllerWithName:context: method
        - note that the cancel button is not localized

        Expected Results:
        Cancel is displayed in the native device language for all supported WatchKit languages, or, the developer is provided with a way to localize this string themselves.

        Actual Results:
        Cancel is displayed in English
