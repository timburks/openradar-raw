    description: "I would like the option to use a 3 number combination password to unlock my AppleWatch. Instead of a 10-digit keypad, there would instead be a rotary dial containing 36 numbers (a small sector would be visible). Turning the Digital Crown would turn the dial. To unlock the AppleWatch, the user would first turn the digital crown down to the first number, then up to the second number, then down to a third number. After 1 second remaining on the third number, the AppleWatch would unlock. As the Digital Crown is turned, the watch could provide haptic feedback, maybe pulse each time a number is inputted.\r\n\r\nThis type of lock screen could be shown on the bottom 15% edge of the screen and would not obscure the watch face. So unlocking/inputting the combination could happen while the user can see the watch face and other complications. (This lockscreen could even be a complication).\r\n\r\nThe combination could be an arbitrary number of numbers, assignable by the user (3 would be suggested, but 1 to n would work just as well)."
