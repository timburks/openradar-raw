    description: "Summary:\nPresenting a UIActivityViewController can sometimes lead to the crash in the attached log. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a UIActivityViewController\n2. Present it using presentViewController:animated:completion:\n\nExpected Results:\nThe view controller is displayed.\n\nActual Results:\nUsually the view controller is displayed but sometimes it leads to this crash. When this happened on my own device I tried a couple of different apps and they both continued to crash until eventually Springboard crashed and rebooted, then the same apps that were crashing worked as expected again.\n\nRegression:\nWe have logs of this happening in iOS 8.3 on iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus\n\nNotes:\nWe also have logs of this happening in the UIActivityViewController presented by the 1Password third party library. The fact it was happening across apps and ultimately resulted in Springboard rebooting which fixed the issue leads me to believe itâ€™s a system issue."
