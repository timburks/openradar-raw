        Summary: Apple Watch is all about filtering your notifications/data/apps to highly personalize it for only the most important information for you. The Apple Watch app should allow you to select a different set of calendars than you see on your iPhone.

        On the iPhone, I subscribe to my wife’s calendar. On the bigger screen, it’s useful to see what events she has planned overlaid with mine. But I don’t want to have her calendar on my Apple Watch. It’s particularly annoying when we both have a shared event, and then my watch face shows “! 2 events” when it’s really a single event that we both go to.

        In the Apple Watch iOS app, under Calendar, if you’ve selected “Custom” as opposed to “Mirror my iPhone”, you should have a calendar selector where you can check off which ones you’d like to see on the watch.
