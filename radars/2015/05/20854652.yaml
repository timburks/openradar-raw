    description: "Summary:\n\nWhen pushing a view controller with hidesBottomBarWhenPushed onto a view controller stack made up of a root UITabBarController and and a UINavigationController, the bottom layout guide for the pushed view controller stays set to the value representing the now hidden tabbar. This happens despite the transition never actually showing the tabbar on the pushed view (the tabbar gets overlaid by the pushed view). \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nOpen the attached sample project and run it on an iPhone or iPad follow the on-screen instructions. Observe the red view on the pushed view controller. This view is anchored to the bottomLayoutGuide\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe red view would be positioned at the very bottom of the view even during the push transition.\n\nActual Results:\n\nThe red view is positioned as if it was above the tabbar, despite the fact the the tabbar is no longer visible. \n\nRegression:\n\niOS 8.3, iPhone, iPad and iOS simulator, happens on previous iOS 8 versions as well. Does not happen on iOS 7. \n\nNotes:\n\nViewController.m has some useful loging that you should be able to see in the console."
