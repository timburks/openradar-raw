    description: "Summary:\nSince iOS 8.0 it is possible to use storyboards/xibs as launch images for apps.\n\nIn our case there’s another approach which would reduce complexity of creating and maintaining launch images as well as reduce the size of app bundles: The ability to use launch images from a pattern image.\n\nFor our app ( https://boldpoker.net ), the launch images simply are the background image we use throughout the app. However, in the app we have one small image which is used as a pattern like [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"table-background”]], which is currently not possible for launch images. \n\nAs we want to make the app launch look as good as possible, the launch images have quite a high quality and thus make up a substantial amount of the storage space needed for our app."
