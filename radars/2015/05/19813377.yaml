    description: "Summary:\r\nIf we learned one thing in the past two years, it's that unencrypted communication is a NO-GO. The XMPP protocol is not secure on its own - the communication with the server may be secure but it isn't end-to-end encrypted - as many other protocols out there. This is what OTR is used for. With OTR every chat protocol can be made end-to-end encrypted, a wide variety of clients support it and I see no reason why Messages should not support it as well. \r\n\r\nFor Apple's own protocol, messages is already end-to-end encrypted however if you offer different chat protocols, you should at least try to make those other protocols equally secure. And if it's just an optional feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
