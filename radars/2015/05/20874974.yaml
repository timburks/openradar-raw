    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nRunning Safari is not shown in command-tab\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Launch Safari\r\n2. Log into a website such as twitter.com, but do NOT click \"Remember me\" or allow Safari to save your password\r\n3. Close all Safari windows\r\n4. Launch Xcode and build a project or five\r\n5. Attempt to command-tab to Safari\r\n6. Notice that Safari is no longer available in the list of running applications in command-tab\r\n7. Launch Safari\r\n8. Go to twitter.com\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nNotice that you are still logged in, which indicates that Safari has NOT actually quit, in spite of it being absent from command-tab\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nIn OSes before Yosemite, when an application disappeared from Command-Tab, it was really not running. Yosemite's \"hide an application while keeping some part of it running\" misleads users into thinking the application has been quit."
