Double tap with two fingers.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou zoom into the map.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou end up zooming out of the map.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can, of course, still pinch to zoom in and out, but double tapping behavior should mirror that of iOS."
