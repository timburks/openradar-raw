    description: "Summary:\r\nUIPrintInteractionController keeps an unsafe_unretained reference to an object that can be deallocated, causing a crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Example. Tap button a few times. Observe crash. Enable Zombies to see *** -[UINavigationController _popoverController]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x7fca83c0b390.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo Crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere seem to be some improvements in iOS 8.4b3 where it doesn’t crash as often, but it’s still pretty easy to get it to crash if you tap the button a bit faster."
