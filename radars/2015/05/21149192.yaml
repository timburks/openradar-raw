        Summary:
        When you single-click an album and it expands down to show all the tracks, the album cover on the right side is not retina-quality, even when the album artwork is available at that quality.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Download a newer album from iTunes that has good artwork, such as the soundtrack to Gladiator.
        2. Click to expand it.
        3. Notice the quality of the album cover on the right side is not retina.
        4. Right-click on the album and load the Get Info window.
        5. Notice the artwork shown there IS retina quality.

        Notes:

        The attached screenshot shows the Get Info window on the left, and the right-side album artwork that has sub-par quality.
