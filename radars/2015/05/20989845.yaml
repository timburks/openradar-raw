    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the header for NSTrackingArea, NSTrackingCursorUpdate is documented as follows: \"owner receives cursorUpdate when mouse enters area.  Cursor is set appropriately when mouse exits area\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's actually sent to the view associated with the NSTrackingArea. -mouseEntered: and -mouseExited: work correctly (see attached project)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the project and run.\r\n- Move the cursor over the red rectangle\r\n- Inspect console logs\r\n\r\nSee attached xcode project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-cursorUpdate: should called on the owner object (TrackingAreaOwner)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-cursorUpdate: called on CursorView instead (see attached project)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem is important to address because <redacted>.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CursorUpdateBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/c5nk6rcmpglfoyf/CursorUpdateBug.zip"
