    description: "Summary:\r\nTwitter is very aggressive in their JPEG image compression, and images uploaded from the SLComposeViewController to Twitter are always sent as JPEGs. The resulting uploaded images look awful and have a ton of artifacts.\r\n\r\nI would be great if SLComposeViewController some way to configure the desired upload format for attached images.\r\n\r\nIf I upload the exact same photo using the SLRequest directly, and force the content type to be image/png, the uploaded image looks great without any issues. But forcing the content type to be image/jpeg produces artifacts as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've included a sample app.\r\n\r\n1. Configure a Twitter account though Settings.app\r\n2. Launch the sample app\r\n3a. Tap the \"Upload with Share Sheet\" button\r\n3b. Tap the \"Upload JPEG\" button\r\n3c. Tap the \"Upload PNG\" button\r\n4. Check Twitter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe uploaded image should be the same quality that was provided by the application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the image uploaded in 3b is of the same quality. The images uploaded in 3a and 3c have artifacts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator and devices"
