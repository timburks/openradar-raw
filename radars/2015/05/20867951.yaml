    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a Swift framework for either iOS or OS X and using only qualified imports for Foundation, the resulting generated header for said framework still contains a global import of foundation and all its symbols because sub-parts of Foundation themselves import globally.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode's Framework template for Mac or iOS to create a new framework.\r\n2. Qualified import any foundation Foundation class.\r\n3. Create a new project.\r\n4. Link with the framework that was just created and import it into a file.\r\n5. CMD+Click the import to jump to the autogenerated header.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly the qualified part of Foundation appears in the imports section of the auto-generated header.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll of Foundation appears imported unqualified in the auto-generated header.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4 (6E14)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
