    description: "When using a CalDAV server (3rd party, not Apple), I cannot use \"Remind me at a location\" or event \"Location\" for calendar entries, these values are just lost when the entry is stored. Might be that the CalDAV Server dosen't support these non-standard attributes (yet I'm not sure the apps even try to store that as a custom attribute, which the server might allow), but even then I'd expect that the phone at least stores theses attributes locally (then they won't get synced - still better than GETTING LOST).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure a non-Apple CalDAV Server\r\n2. Add Reminder or calendar Event\r\n3. Add a location\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe location is still there when editing end. If possible, is synced to CalDAV server (and thus do other devices as well - maybe as a custom attribute or encoded in some standard field that can be \"abused\" for that purpose), if not possible, it is at least remembered locally on the device (and the event w/o location is synced to server).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe location is just lost, it's gone and all the location features are unusable."
