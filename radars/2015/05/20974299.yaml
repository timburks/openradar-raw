    description: "Summary:\r\nCFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL leaks the CFRunLoopSourceRef it returns if the URL passed as the first parameter cannot be reached.\r\n\r\nUpon LLDB examination, it seems that the CFRunLoopSource is cached (retained) within a PACCacheEntry in \"EnqueuePACExecutionForKey\", and is only released (balancing the retain) in PACCacheEntry_ConstructJSContext.\r\n\r\nHowever, PACCacheEntry_ConstructJSContext is only called when the PAC file was successfully downloaded (whether it actually was a PAC file or not).\r\n\r\nThis means that the CFRunLoopSourceRef is never released (well, it would be released within 24hrs when the PACCacheEntry expires), and that brings a second problem: the \"release\" function pointer of the CFStreamClientContext structure is not called either, until the source is released.\r\nThis creates a leak within the client application as well, if it uses the \"retain\" and \"release\" function pointers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write code calling CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL properly (attached in this radar [1])\r\n2. Make sure to use an unreachable URL as the first argument (like \"htp://apple.com\") (see attached code [1])\r\n3. Start \"Allocations\" in instruments, with \"Record reference counts\" activated\r\n4. Run within instruments\r\n5. Once finished, look for CFRunLoopSourceRef\r\n6. Select the one created where responsible caller is \"CreateCFNExecutePACContext\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe object should be released properly, whether the URL passed to CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL was reachable or not\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe CFRunLoopSourceRef is still live despite CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL being finished with running, and the only retain call missing a balancing release is EnqueuePACExecutionForKey.\r\n\r\nIt seems the only balancing place is in PACCacheEntry_ConstructJSContext, which seems to only be called upon successful download. As the URL was unreachable, this function was not called, and the CFRunLoopSourceRef is leaked.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.4 (14E17e)\r\n\r\nAttachements:\r\n[1] https://www.dropbox.com/s/ymeoigea3syzh9i/CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL-leak.zip"
