        Summary:
        If, while running an Xcode debug session with a share extension, you tap on More… and remove the share extension and re-add the share extension, it will not show up automatically next time the share UI is shown.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Create a new Xcode iOS Project
        2) Add a share extension target
        3) Activate the share extension scheme
        4) Build and run
        5) Choose Photos.app
        6) Select a photo
        7) Tap share button
        8) Tap More… button
        9) Activate the new share extension scheme
        10) Press done
        11) Press cancel to cancel sharing
        12) Press Share button again


        Expected Results:
        The new share extension is visible in the default list, and should be CHECKED in the “More…” list

        Actual Results:
        The new share extension is NOT visible in the default list, and is CHECKED in the “More…” list. Changing any of the switches and tapping Done will show the new share extension in the default list.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
