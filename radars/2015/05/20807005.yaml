    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Watch's Now Playing glance should be able to launch third-party apps. In the same way that tapping on the title opens the watch's Music app (which is also how Control Center works for third-party apps) it should launch the app that's currently playing if it has an installed watch app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start playing music from a third-party watch app (ex: Pacemaker).\r\n2. Navigate to the Now Playing glance.\r\n3. Tap the track title.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe third-party app that's currently playing is launched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatch OS 1.0 + iOS 8.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Sport (42mm) + iPhone 6"
