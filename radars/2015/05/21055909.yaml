        Summary:
        There is a problem on iPhone 6+ when containing UINavigationControllers within a UITabBarController so that it creates a “more” tab.
        When a controller is selected from the “more” table view and the device is then rotated to landscape orientation so that the associated tab item is displayed on the tab bar (the 6+ has a different number of items in portrait and landscape), an empty navigation controller is displayed. This does not happen when adding plain UIViewControllers to the tab controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Open the associated project
        2) Run it on iPhone 6+ (simulator or device) in portrait mode
        3) Open the “more” tab
        4) Select e.g. “Controller 7”
        5) Rotate to landscape orientation

        Expected Results:
        The original navigation controller with its root view controller (recognisable by green background color) should be displayed.

        Actual Results:
        An empty UINavigationController is displayed. After rotating back to portrait, the correct controller is displayed.

        Regression:
        Only appears on iPhone 6+, probably due to the different number of available tab bar items in portrait and landscape.

        Notes:
        The attached zip file contains a sample project demonstrating the issue.
