    description: "Summary:\nI find UINavigationControllerDelegate’s behavior with the back gesture just wrong.\n-willShowViewController: gets called only once for the previous view controller. After that no indication whether user canceled the gesture. Neither -willShowViewController: or -didShowViewController: get called when the user cancels the back gesture, making it impossible to know what happened of that action and what’s the final state of UINavigationController\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nImplement \n- navigationController:willShowViewController:animated:\n– navigationController:didShowViewController:animated:\nand start dragging the view to begin a back gesture. You’ll notice that -willShowViewController: will get called one for the previous controller. Cancel the back gesture. No callback. It’s impossible to know what’s the state of UINavigationController now.\n\nExpected Results:\nBoth -navigationController:willShowViewController:animated: and -navigationController:didShowViewController:animated: should be called if the user cancels the back gesture.\n\nActual Results:\nNo delegate callback is performed.\n\nNotes:\nhttps://twitter.com/marcosero/status/603830762920669184"
