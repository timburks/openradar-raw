    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is impossible to retrieve value from NSDictionary, returned by [NSEntityDescription attributesByName], using NSString as a key.\r\n\r\nThis issue is only reproducible if:\r\n— binary is compiled on OSX 10.9 with Xcode 5,\r\n— binary is executed on OSX 10.9, \r\n— [NSEntityDescription attributesByName] returns dictionary with more then one object, \r\n— the key must be must be of “__NSCFString” class. \r\n\r\nThis bug is not reproducible if binary was compiled on OSX 10.8, or binary that was compiled on OSX 10.9 is executed on OSX 10.8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFirst way to reproduce bug:\r\n1. Have a Apple computer running OSX 10.9 with Xcode 5.\r\n2. Build attached project “PFEncodedStringTest 2 attributes” and run it.\r\n3. Monitor the log.\r\n\r\nSecond way to reproduce it:\r\n1. Have a Apple computer running OSX 10.9 with Xcode 5.\r\n2. Create new project with core data.\r\n3. Create entity with 2 or more attributes.\r\n4. Get attributesByName NSDictionary from that entity’s description (NSEntityDescription).\r\n5. Generate a NSString key that is of “NSCFString” class.\r\n6. Try to retrieve object for that key, from attributesByName NSDictionary.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSDictionary should return NSAttributeDescription object for supplied key.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSDictionary returns nil.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode - Version 5.0.1 (5A2053)\r\nOSX - Version 10.9 (13A603)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEntity must have 2 attributes or more.\r\nAsk object for value, from NSDictionary retuned by [NSEntityDescription attributesByName], with NSString key that is of “NSCFString” class.\r\nCompile project on OSX 10.9 with Xcode 5.\r\nExecute binary on OSX 10.9.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PFEncodedStringTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
