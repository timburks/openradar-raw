    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using autolayou to let the system be responsible for height of UITableViewCells the UITableView jumps when scrolling.\r\nEspecially visible when the cells differ largely in size.\r\n\r\nIn other words:\r\nWhen the content of a cell (lets say a UILabel) varies in height (due to different amount of text), the cell itself aligns to its height automatically.\r\n\r\nNow, if you scroll through the TableView you will notice jumps. The bigger the differences in size, the more visible is the jumps (especially when scrolling slow â€“ a fast scroll won't let you observe the jumps).\r\nAlso notice the ScrollViewIndicator on the right hand side when scrolling. It will jump, too.\r\n\r\nThe only way to minimize the jumps it to provide an exact value in\r\nestimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath. \r\nHowever, the meaning of using autolayout is to let the system calculate the height of a cell. If it is necessary to provide a (nearly) exact estimation, this point will be missed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the app contained in the sample project I attached.\r\n2. Scroll slowly through the TableView and notice the jumps.\r\n3. If you scroll fast you will notice a jumping ScrollViewIndicator, too.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the TableView to scroll smoothly no mater what size autolayout calculated for the containing cells.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA jumping TableView and also jumping ScrollViewIndicator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n> iOS 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease also read the comments about the estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath method contained in 'TableViewController.swift' (attached sample project)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBasically every iOS Simulator as well as the iPhone\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableViewCellWithAutoLayoutiOS8.zip' was successfully uploaded."
