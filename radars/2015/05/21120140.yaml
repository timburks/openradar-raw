    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the cache policy is set during creation of an NSURLRequest using \r\ninitWithURL:cachePolicy:timeoutInterval:, and a cachePolicy of ReturnCacheDataElseLoad, if there is no existing data in the cache, the data is loaded from the network, but it is not cached as expected.\r\n\r\nIf no caching is expected, the documentation should be changed to be more explicit about the caching expectations.\r\n\r\nIf caching is expected, I have included a project that exhibits the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the project, run the app, view the console in Xcode, note the date of the response\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe date of the response should not change after the first load of the request.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe date of the response changes after all loads of the request.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Simulator, version 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6, Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'cache-testing.zip' was successfully uploaded."
