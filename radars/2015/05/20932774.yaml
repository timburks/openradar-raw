        Summary:
        When an Alarm complication is placed in the large center position on the Modular face, it should include a time until the alarm rings.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an alarm.
        2. Select the Modular face.
        3. Customize it to put the Alarm complication in the center position.
        4. Look at the watch face.

        Expected Results:
        The complication includes text like “3hrs 5mins”, along the lines of the Sunrise/Sunset complication.

        Actual Results:
        The complication includes the fixed text “Alarm” and the time the alarm will go off. There is no indication of how long it’ll be until the alarm goes off.

        Notes:
        I very often want to know how much time I have before an alarm goes off—in particular, if it’s getting towards bedtime, I like to know how long it is until my wake-up alarm goes off.
