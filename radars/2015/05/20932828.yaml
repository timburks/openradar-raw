        Summary:
        The Solar face should allow you to add two or three complications along the bottom.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select the Solar face.
        2. Look for a Customize button.

        Expected Results:
        There is one, and it allows you to adjust complications at the bottom of the face.

        Actual Results:
        This face is not customizable, and doesn’t support complications.

        Notes:
        I’m currently using the Modular face with Date, Sunrise/Sunset, Timer, Activity, and World Clock complications. The Solar face is beautiful, and the standard layout subsumes the functionality of the Date and Sunrise/Sunset complications, but without the other three (well, maybe I can drop one of them), Solar is simply impractical.

        There appears to be space at the bottom of the face for these complications to be added; they could be hidden when using the digital crown to examine the various points on the sun’s arc, or they could be adjusted to reflect the correct values for those complications at the selected time.
