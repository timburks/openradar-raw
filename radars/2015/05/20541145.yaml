    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening the new/add album dialog in Photos and \"Full Keyboard Access\" is enabled, the initially focused element in the dialog is the pop-up of existing albums, but I think it should be the name field as is the case if \"Full Keyboard Access\" is disabled. If someone really wants to pick an existing album instead (which is the rather less likely case IMHO), he can just hit Shift+Tab to get there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System Preferences\r\n2. Select \"Keyboard\"\r\n3. Set \"Full Keyboard Access\" to \"All controls\"\r\n4. Open Photos\r\n5. Select a photo\r\n6. Click the + button\r\n7. Select \"Album\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe focused UI element is the text view, so you can type in a name and confirm the creation of an album with that name hitting enter.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe focused UI element is the pop-up and when you start typing, you'll accidentally search in the pop-up, causing the text field to vanish.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 (14D131)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac mini (Late 2009)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
