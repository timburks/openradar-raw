        I want to create a separate "Issues" window.

        I can set up a behavior on "Generates new issues" so that it does:

        [√] Show tab names [Issues] in [separate window]
        [√] [Hide] navigator
        [√] Navigate to [current log]

        However, that does not show the log in the editor, but rather just an old log.
