        Summary:
        I’m trying to figure out why Swift is erroring out on a moderately complex chain of expressions. Right now the only way for me to do this is to tear it apart and puzzle out what the types should be and then put it back together, corrected.

        This process would be far better if Xcode would show me the instantiated types instead of just the declared types for e.g. functions. It does me almost no good to know that _1 is:

            public func _1<T, U>() -> Lens<(T, U), U>

        whereas I would gain rather a lot from learning what T and U are instantiated to. In particular, I could use this to discover what type I need to provide for another operand and hence correct it with much less effort—I could simply comment out the rejected part of the expression instead of having to tear it all out into temporary variables and annotating with explicit types.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        N/A

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        Visual Studio 2013 does this. Probably earlier versions, too.
