    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an accessibility hint or label is ever set on a user interface element in Xcode, it can never be completely removed without hand editing the storyboard file, preventing the default hint or label from being used at run time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip the attached archive, AccessibilityTest.zip\r\n2. From within the newly created folder, open AccessibilityTest.xcodeproj in Xcode.\r\n3. Build and run the application on a device with VoiceOver enabled.\r\n4. Note that the button in the middle of the screen uses the default Accessibility Label, which is the title of the button (\"Accessible Button\").\r\n5. Back in Xcode, open Main.storyboard\r\n6. Select the \"Accessible Button\" button.\r\n7. Press ⌥⌘3 to open the Identity Inspector\r\n8. Scroll down until you see the Accessibility information and set the Accessibility Label to \"Test\".\r\n9. Build and run the application again and note that the button now uses the accessibility label \"Test\"\r\n10. Back in Xcode, delete the contents of the Accessibility Label so the field is empty.\r\n11. Build and run the application again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button would use the default accessibility label, which is the title of the button (\"Accessible Button\").\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button has no accessibility label, so VoiceOver simple says \"Button\" when it is selected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.1 (6D1002), all OS X and iOS versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the storyboard file, before editing the accessibility label there is no property at all for the accessibility label. Once the label has been added and then removed, there is a property for it with an empty string. The issue can be resolved by removing the label property by hand in a text editor.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs with all software and hardware configurations I've tried it on.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AccessibilityTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
