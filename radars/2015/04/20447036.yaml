    description: "Summary:\nWhen hiding a photo, Photos.app shows a confirmation dialog:\n\n    Hide 1 Photo\n    \n    This photo will be hidden from Moments, Collections, and Years but can be found in the Hidden album.\n    \n    [Cancel] [Hide Photo]\n\nThere should be a way to avoid showing this alert.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Select a photo.\n2. Right-click.\n3. Choose “Hide 1 Photo”.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe resulting alert has a “Don’t show this again” checkbox.\n\nActual Results:\nIt does not. There is no apparent way to avoid seeing this alert every time you hide a photo. This gets annoying after the seventh or eighth time.\n\nNotes:\nI’m not married to the on-alert checkbox; I would be satisfied by other ways to avoid this alert, like having a checkbox in Preferences or skipping the alert when Option is held. This is just the most obvious and discoverable way to do it that I could think of."
