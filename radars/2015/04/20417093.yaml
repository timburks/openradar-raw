        Summary:
        A session/login cookie gathered while using a WKWebView is not permanently removed when using NSHTTPCookieStorage.sharedHTTPCookieStorage().deleteCookie. This only works if the WKWebView instance is removed from the view stack and nil’d out before calling deleteCookie.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use a WKWebView instance to log into a site with a known login cookie. In my case it was a Rails server using out-of-the-box cookie-based session management.
        2. Observe that NSHTTPCookieStorage.sharedHTTPCookieStorage().cookies contains the expected cookie
        3. Loop through all cookies and, for each, delete it using NSHTTPCookieStorage.sharedHTTPCookieStorage().deleteCookie(cookie)
        4. Observe that is now an empty collection
        5. Quit the application via double home button tap and swipe up to toss the card away
        6. Restart the application and observe that SHTTPCookieStorage.sharedHTTPCookieStorage().cookies contains the cookie that was supposedly deleted

        Expected Results:
        The cookies that were deleted using deleteCookie() stay deleted.

        Actual Results:
        The cookies that were deleted using deleteCookie() are not deleted after restarting the application.

        Regression:
        Unknown

        Notes:
        This can be seen on both the iOS 8.2 Simulator and hardware – iPad 2, in my case. The solution for this is to run removeFromSuperview() on the associated WKWebView instance, nil it out, then attempt to delete cookies.
