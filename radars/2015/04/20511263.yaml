    description: "Summary:\r\nSharing a photo via the inbuilt share sheet on the new Photos app blocks _all_ toolbar UI interactions until the photo/message has actually been sent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a photo from an album\r\n2. Open the Share Sheet for 'Messages'\r\n3. Provide a recipient and body\r\n4. Send the message\r\n5. Attempt to click on _any_ UI element in the app toolbar\r\n6. Observe the action is disabled, and the disabled 'ding' system sound is played, ie. the app can't even be closed with the traffic light controls.\r\n...\r\n7. Wait for the message sent 'whoosh' sound and the UI becomes responsive again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce the share share sheet UI has been dismissed (either by cancelling or sending) the UI should be responsive to all interactions and the message should be sent in the background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEntire UI is disabled until the message has actually been sent.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X: 10.10.3\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nPhotos App: Version 1.0 (209.52.0)"
