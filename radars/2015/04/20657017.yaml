    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift.Dictionary conforms to `DictionaryLiteralConvertible`, implementing the necessary `init(dictionaryLiteral:)`. As the internals of a varargs method involves an array, Swift.Dictionary must already support efficiently initializing with external tuple storage.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to use functional concepts in Swift (lazy, map, filter) to create a Swift.Dictionary.\r\n2. Be sad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne should be able to initialize a dictionary with a sequence of tuples, such as with the expression `Dictionary(lazy(myArray).filter({ … }).map({ … })`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne must write their own initializer chaining to `init(minimumCapacity:)` and looping through the sequence, which might not have optimal performance compared to the `NativeDictionaryStorage` stuff used within the literal initializer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSwift 1.2 (swiftlang-602.0.49.6), Xcode 6.3.1 (6D1002), Mac OS X 10.10.4 (14E7f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in all current public versions of Swift.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
