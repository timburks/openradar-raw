    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads when downloading new or updated documentation or simulators the progress bars don't update. You have to move to another tab of the view and come back to the downloads tab to see any change\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Have a fresh install of XCode\r\n2) Go to Preferences -> Downloads\r\n3) Select an item you don't have downloaded to start downloading\r\n4) Watch the progress bar not move towards complete - wait a few minutes depending on network speed\r\n5) Go to another tab in the Preferences view\r\n6) Come back to the Downloads tab\r\n7) Note that the progress bar has jumped forward, or even completed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the progress bar to move with the download without having to change tabs\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe progress bar doesn't update while the Preferences panel is left on the Downloads tab\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode Version 6.3 (6D570) - also seen on previous builds"
