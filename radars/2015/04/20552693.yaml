    description: "Summary:\r\nWe use NSFetchedResultsController to display entities with a transient property.\r\nThis transient property used by FRC to separate objects into different sections. If FRC performs fetch and any context with `NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType`  executes fetch request on a private queue application crashes with the following exceptions:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'statement is still active'\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '_obtainOpenChannel -- NSSQLCore 0x1464ecf0: no database channel is available'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download sample project and run it an device or simulator.\r\n2. Soon after launching the application you should get the exception.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect 1 million dollars and job offer from Apple, but we can start with something easer: FRC should be thread safe.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have no many, no job offer, but only exception together with frustrated users :)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/h8xtlk7ggc02eus/CoreData.zip?dl=0"
