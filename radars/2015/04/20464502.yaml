        Summary:

        The searchable list of developer tools downloads on https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action is incomplete. It would be great if that page could be relied on to always contain all available downloads of developer tools.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open site
        2. Search for Xcode

        Expected Results:

        Find “Xcode 6.3 beta 4”, as it is available for download via other pages in the developer portal.

        Actual Results:

        Xcode 6.3 beta 4 is missing.
