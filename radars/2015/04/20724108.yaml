        Summary:
        The Apple Watch automatic install feature is super useful for when existing apps first get watch apps, or when installing new ones, but currently, if you remove an app from the watch and the parent app receives an update, it will automatically install it again.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install an iOS app with a WatchKit extension
        2. Verify the WatchKit app was installed to the watch
        3. Delete the app from the Watch
        4. Update the parent app

        Expected Results:
        The WatchKit app should stay deleted.

        Actual Results:
        The WatchKit app was reinstalled

        Regression:
