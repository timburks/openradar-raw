    description: "Summary:\n\nI would like to create simple notes while on-the-go using my Apple Watch. Specifically, I get ideas while driving and need to save them before I forget.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1) Go for a drive\n2) Get an idea\n3) Raise your wrist and say “Hey Siri create a note saying the Apple Watch is pretty awesome”\n\nExpected Results:\n\nA note with the text “The Apple Watch is pretty awesome” is created in iCloud and appears on my Mac and iPhone.\n\nActual Results:\n\nSiri tells me to use Handoff which requires me to take my eyes off the road, find my iPhone and swipe up on the home screen, eventually leading to a horrific crash but hopefully not vehicular manslaughter. \n\nRegression:\n\nN/A\n\nNotes:\n\nLike Reminders, I will never want to refer to the list of items on my watch. It’s more appropriate to view them on another device. But I’m sure there will be some masochists who demand an app on the watch itself."
