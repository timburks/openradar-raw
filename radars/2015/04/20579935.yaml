        Summary:
        If we set up the background color of a couple of buttons on a storyboard the colors look slightly darker than the correct ones; but setting the values via code shows the correct colors when running both on device and simulator.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Set the background color of a button via Storyboard to RGB(0,159,242)
        Compile and run; see the rendered color (take a screenshot).

        The on viewDidLoad or wherever; even on the buttonâ€™s action if you want to set the background color of the button to RGB(0,159,242) via code, compile and run and notice how the colors are render differently. (take a screenshot).

        Open up Adobe CC and then pickcolor both background colors and compare; notice how the values set via code match the correct RGB values but the color set on IB is off

        Expected Results:
        Setting the background color of a button via IB or code should show the exact same color.

        Actual Results:
        The colors when set via IB are slightly darker than when set via code.

        Notes:
        This is HIGHLY critical since we try most of the UI via IB and we set the RGB or HEX colors our designers send to us from PS directly into Xcode and the wrong colors are sometimes hard to perceive but overall WRONG and the tools should correctly render the values specified.
