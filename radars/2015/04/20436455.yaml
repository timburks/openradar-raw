    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple ‘Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader’ does not function with the iPhone 6 Plus. Unlike its 30-pin predecessor, the product does not contain ‘iPad’ in its name, and yet it is only functional when used with an iPad. This seems odd, as the hardware would obviously function just fine with the iPhone, it has simply been artificially prevented from doing so.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Purchase a ‘Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader’ for $29 + tax.\r\n2. Arrive home and remove the adapter from the box.\r\n3. Insert an SD card into the appropriate slot on the adapter.\r\n4. Insert the Lightning cable on the adapter into the Lightning port on an iPhone.\r\n5. Observe the error message (see screenshot), which states that the adapter is not compatible with the iPhone.\r\n6. Connect the adapter to the iPad you have lying nearby which happens to be one that was manufactured two years before the iPhone you just tried.\r\n7. Observe that it works just fine with the iPad.\r\n8. Throw your hands up in frustration, bitch a little on Twitter, and then file a Radar because what else are you going to do\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader should function with any device possessing a Lightning port.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader does not function in any device possessing a Lightning port.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6 Plus, 8.2/12D508\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ncome on folks seriously wtf"
