    description: "In versions of iOS prior to 8.3, the last action added to the UIAlertController is presented as the default option, styled in bold and put in the default position (for two button alert controllers). In 8.3, only the cancel action is presented as the default option, regardless of the order added. If there is no cancel action, nothing is presented as the default option.\r\n\r\n---\r\nClosed by Apple with the following reason:\r\n\r\nThis issue behaves as intended based on the following:\r\n\r\nThis is an intentional change - the cancel button is to be bolded in alerts.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
