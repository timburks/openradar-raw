    description: "It would be helpful for developers if they could easily retrieve the public key of a x.509 certificate (SecCertificateRef). Within the OSX Security.Framework there is a method available SecCertificateCopyPublicKey() but unfortunately this is not available to us as iOS developers. \r\n\r\nIf we could have a similar port, this would allow us to pin the public key of an SSL certificate rather than the certificate as a whole. SecTrustCopyPublicKey() allows us to get the public key of the whole certificate, but not retrieve the public key of the root certificate, which is the first certificate within the whole certificate's chain."
