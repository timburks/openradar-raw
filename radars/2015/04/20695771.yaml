        Summary:
        Xcode cannot export developer profile making cross team development impossible

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Prefs > Account > Export Accounts, save name, fail

        Expected Results:
        Export to a file

        Actual Results:
        Error: Could not export identity from the keychain

        Console:
        4/24/15 5:50:44.155 PM Xcode[49946]: Error, Could not export identity from the keychain: The user name or passphrase you entered is not correct.

        Except I did not enter a username, and it was previously working fine.

        Regression:
        This worked on previous versions of xcode.
