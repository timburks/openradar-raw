        Summary:
        While developing the watch app, I have to manually attach to the parent process because when the parent crashes the watch target have little useful information on where the crash occurs.  However, if the parent target is attached the break on all exception breakpoint helps me debug problematic code paths.  The current workaround is to put a break point very early on the watch target, then go to debug -> attach to process -> attach to the parent process.  It would be great if Xcode does that automatically.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Run watch app target from Xcode.
        2. Parent app crashes, watch target is still running

        Expected Results:
        Xcode attach to both the watch target and the parent process automatically, when the parent app crashes, exception breakpoints will catches it.


        Actual Results:
        Have to manually attach to parent appâ€™s process.

        Notes:
        The current workaround is to put a break point very early on the watch target, then go to debug -> attach to process -> attach to the parent process.  It would be great if Xcode does that automatically.
