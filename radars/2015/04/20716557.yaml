    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I change the system language on my Apple Watch, about 4 min later, I get a popup on my Watch that the current charger being used is not made by Apple and therefore is not supported - ...however, the Watch is on my wrist when this happens, not hooked up to any charger. \r\n\r\nEither I'm more conductive than I thought, or there's a bug here.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Watch iPhone app\r\n2. Change language in General > Language & Region > System Language\r\n3. Wait ~4 min\r\n4. See attached popup\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Watch should not warn me about a charging cable when it is on my wrist \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Watch warns me about using the wrong charging cable when it is on my wrist after changing the system language\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, Watch OS 1.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB Verizon, Apple Watch Sport 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'charging.png' was successfully uploaded."
