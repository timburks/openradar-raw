        Summary:
        Currently (Xcode 6) you only get an overview of what’s currently happening with the build if it’s a built-in Xcode action (build, test, analyze, etc.), but you have no visibility on what a trigger is doing as it runs.

        Please either show the last X number of lines of log output from the trigger script (where X is configurable), as many other CI systems do (Bamboo, Travis), so you can more easily spot problems with your custom integration scripts.
