        Summary:

        TestFlight should support multiple versions of an app in the beta testing stage at once.

        We have a major new version of our app ready to ship (Pending Developer Release), but now we can’t:
        1) upload new builds for this version for beta testing without rejecting the already approved build
        2) create a new version for testing

        1 wouldn’t be a problem if 2 would be possible. It would make testing apps with TestFlight much more useful if we could, for example, have the following version for testing:

        2.0, Pending Developer Release (waiting for launch date)
        2.0.1, external beta testing for minor bug fixes to be submitted for review as soon as 2.0 is Ready for Sale
        2.1, internal & external beta testing with new features
