    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen exposing a Swift class to Objective-C with another name by using the @objc(...) prefix, that name is not respected by Objective-C. Instead Objective-C uses the same name for the class as Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a class in Swift and give it another name when exposed to Objective-C like this: @objc(SMPLSwiftViewController) class SwiftViewController: UIViewController { ... }\r\n2. Import the automatically generated Swift Header in an Objective-C file (e.g. \"#import SampleApplication-Swift.h\")\r\n3. Try to use the Swift class in the Objective-C file by referring to it with its Objective-C name (\"SMPLSwiftViewController\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Swift class is recognized by its Objective-C name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode prints an error saying \"Unknown receiver 'SMPLSwiftViewController'; did you mean 'SwiftViewController'?\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI can verify that this problem exists at least since Xcode 6.3 beta 3. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26132823/name-of-swift-class-when-exposed-to-objective-c-code-does-not-respect-the-objc suggests that it exists since Xcode 6.0.1. The problem also exists when importing the Swift code as a dynamic framework."
