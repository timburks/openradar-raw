    description: "Summary:\r\nThe two view controllers provide near identical functionality in nearly all aspects and should be merged. Applications that can open Document file types should be placed in the Application Activities section of the UIActivityViewController when presented with an NSURL pointing to the local filesystem, and the UIDocumentInteractionController should be deprecated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch a UIActivityViewController with an NSURL pointing to a file on the file system.\r\n\r\nCompare to a UIDocumentInteractionController for the same URL.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIActivityViewController includes applications that can Open files in the Application Activities list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIActivityViewController displays only applications that include an iOS 8 App Extension, and UIDocumentInteractionController displays only applications that define document support using their Info.plist settings.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
