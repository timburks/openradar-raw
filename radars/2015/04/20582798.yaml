    description: "Summary:\r\nScreen curtain is not persistent across restarts of VoiceOver or the computer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start VoiceOver.\r\n\r\n2. Turn on Screen Curtain (VO+Shift+F11).\r\n\r\n3. Turn off VoiceOver.\r\n\r\n4. Turn on VoiceOver.\r\n\r\n5. Steps 3 and 4 are automatic if the computer is restarted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreen Curtain should be re-enabled when VoiceOver is started, provided that it was on for the user account when VoiceOver was last switched off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen Curtain doesn't persist; it's always off when VoiceOver is restarted, regardless of whether it was on when VoiceOver was last switched off.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe intended behaviour described is that presently found in the version of VoiceOver in iOS."
