        Summary:
        In iOS 7 the notifications for the keyboard started using an undocumented UIViewAnimationCurve. As you can see from this StackOverflow question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18837166/how-to-mimic-keyboard-animation-on-ios-7-to-add-done-button-to-numeric-keyboar) this confuses a lot of people, but is possible to work around by using the legacy UIView animation methods.

        However, while this does work in ObjC, Swift does not allow you to use an integer value as an enum directly. Further, this keeps developers from using the much more clean block based animation apis.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to animate a view along with the keyboard either using Swift or block based animations.

        Expected Results:
        The notification should include a public animation curve that can be converted to a public animation option for block based animations.

        Actual Results:
        Secret sauce that we shouldnâ€™t touch.
