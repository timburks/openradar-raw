    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Notification Center Service (ANCS) provides a time and date for notifications in the Notification Center of iOS. However, the time and date is lacking timezone information.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that knowing the timestamp is in \"local time\" would be enough. However, this is problematic if the user has set the local time zone of the accessory to be different from the iOS device. In this case, the accessory does not get enough information from ANCS to display the time of the notification correctly.\r\n\r\nSee the date specification here:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Appendix/Appendix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013460-CH3-SW6\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nANCS should provide time zone information with its date/time stamps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo time zone information is provided by ANCS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
