    description: "When the background mode for locations is enabled, and the `CLLocationManager` has `requestWhenInUseAuthorization` access, the blue location bar appears after exiting the app. This occurs even when `stopUpdatingLocation` has been called in either `applicationDidEnterBackground` or `applicationWillResignActive`.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enable the background mode for location access\r\n2. `requestWhenInUseAuthorization`\r\n3. Start updating location\r\n4. Stop updating location in either `UIApplicationDelegate` method\r\n5. Put the app in the background\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe blue location bar never appears since we are no longer accessing the user's location.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nNote the blue location bar appears immediately and disappears after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis combination of things makes sense when we don't always want to access the user's location in the background, but do other times (such as when the user wants directions). You can also reproduce this behavior using Google Maps on iOS."
