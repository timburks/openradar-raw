        Summary:
        If you have a book open in iBooks and use Divvy (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/divvy-window-manager/id413857545?mt=12&uo=4&at=10lsEt) to resize the window, it doesn’t reflow text.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an .epub file in iBooks.
        2. Use Divvy to resize the window.

        Expected Results:
        Text will be reflowed around the new window size.

        Actual Results:
        Text is not reflowed, looking awkward at times (see screenshot).

        Regression:
        Unknown

        Notes:
        This only appears to happen for ePub books manually imported to iBooks. iBooks books are fine.

        This may be an underlying issue in OS X; there are other apps that don’t respond well to being resized in this manner. It’s almost like there’s a callback when the window is resized that isn’t called when Divvy (or another tool) resizes the window.
