    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS versions prior to 8.2, the Connection Signature Resolving Key would get exchanged if the Bluetooth LE accessory supported this.\r\n\r\nSince iOS 8.2, this key no longer seems to be exchanged.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear whether this is a bug or omitted on purpose.\r\nWe were saving this key in case signed requests would get supported by Core Bluetooth one day...\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair a Bluetooth LE accessory that accepts CRSK during the pairing\r\n2. Observe the CSRK is not exchanged in iOS 8.2 / 8.3\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe CSRK was always getting exchanged prior to iOS 8.2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe CSRK is not exchanged in iOS 8.2 / 8.3\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
