    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen calling reloadSections:withRowAnimation: on a UITableView, the section header that is being reloaded runs into auto layout issues in form of console warnings, however the section header appears to layout just fine in the end. These warnings are not appearing on scroll or on first load. Only reloading of a section.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1: Set a size for your table section header views\r\n2: Layout your section header views using auto layout\r\n3: Ask the table view to reload a particular section\r\n4: Watch the console complain about auto layout constraints in your section header\r\n5: Notice that on reload, the warnings in the console seem to think the heigh and width of the section are 0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe layout engine should not assume the height and width are zero and thus shouldn't not attempt to break constraints to satisfy a zero height and width on reload.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe layout engine attempts to break constraints in order to satisfy a height and width that is false.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1, 8.2, 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSetting an auto resizing mask on the UITableViewHeaderFooterView's contentView has no impact nor does using constraints to wrap the content view in the UITableViewHeaderFooterView.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 & Simulator (all)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ReloadSectionsAutoLayoutSample.zip' and 'ReloadSectionLog.log' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nSample code is available for download https://www.dropbox.com/s/865b2kk8f4dy12g/ReloadSectionsAutoLayoutSample.zip"
