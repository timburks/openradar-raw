    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a UITableViewCell, a UILabel that is set up with constraints in Interface Builder to resize dynamically to accommodate multiple lines, instead truncates the text initially. \r\n\r\nIf the section (not the specific row) is reloaded, the cell recalculates and shows the entire text in multiple lines. Reloading the section again, recalculates and sets the label back the wrong size. This can be repeated ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the cell is large enough to accommodate the entire label, which leads me to believe it does actually calculate the appropriate size at some point.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached project.\r\n2. Tap ‘Show UITableViewController’ button.\r\n3. ‘Noodlewerk Apps’ title label shown at incorrect size.\r\n4. Tap ‘Reload this section’ button.\r\n5. ‘Noodlewerk Apps’ title label shown at *correct* size.\r\n6. Go to step 3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ‘Noodlewerk Apps’ title label should not change sizes and always show the entire text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe ‘Noodlewerk Apps’ title label initially appears at the incorrect size and truncates its text. Reloading the cell alternates the label between the correct and incorrect size.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProject is included in the accompanying zip file, along with two screenshots showing the correct and incorrect state. \r\nThe same phenomenon can be seen in the sections below ‘About this company’, but the cell behaviour is different and under development."
