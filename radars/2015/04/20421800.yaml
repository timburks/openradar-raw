    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a category header (with a plus sign in its name) declares additional inspectables on the class, those inspectables appear first in the Attributes inspector, before the inspectables that are declared in the main @interface. Headers should not be sorted in strict ASCII order; consideration should be given to delimiters such as _ and +. Observe how the Assistant editor arranges counterparts so that the main header is always first.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In a file “Building.h”, declare a class Building to have the inspectable properties “houseNumber” and “streetName”.\r\n2. In a separate file “Building+NYCAdditions.h”, declare a category Buliding (Flat) to have the additional inspectable properties “suiteNumber” and “numberOfRooms”.\r\n3. Insert an instance of Building into a storyboard and switch to the Attributes inspector.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe “House Number” and “Street Name” fields should come before the “Suite Number” and “Number Of Rooms” fields. “Building+NYCAdditions.h” should be considered to come after “Building.h”, just as it does in the Counterparts section of the assistant menu. (Also note the poor capitalization of “Of”.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe “House Number” and “Street Name” fields come after the “Suite Number” and “Number Of Rooms” fields, because “Building+NYCAdditions.h” comes before “Building.h” in ASCII sort order.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3b3 (6D554n)\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.3b3 (6D554n)\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109) \r\nXcode 6.3b3 (6D554n)\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
