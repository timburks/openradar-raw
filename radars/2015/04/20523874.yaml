    description: "Summary:\r\nBuilding and running Unit Tests for an Xcode Project that uses a target for it’s tests isn’t possible.\r\nThe only reliable way I can make projects run tests from the command line is to use a scheme for tests, although this isn't setup by default.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n  1. Create a new Xcode Project (I'm using an empty Cocoa application)\r\n  2. Open Terminal.app\r\n  3. cd into the same directory as the xcode project\r\n  4. run `xcodebuild test` - it will detect the project and fail to run the tests\r\n  5. Fine, lets be more explicit: run `xcodebuild -project $project_name -target ${project_name}Tests test` -- still fails\r\n  6. Ok, what about specifying configuration? `xcodebuild -project $project_name -target ${project_name}Tests -configuration Debug test` -- still fails\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should run the tests\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt failed with \"test action is unsupported\""
