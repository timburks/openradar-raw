        Summary:
        When clicking through and downloading the free songs of the week, I can only click the first 5 before iTunes starts to become unresponsive

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Browse to Free on iTunes in the iTunes store
        2. Verify that there are around 10 songs listed
        3. Start clicking “Get” on each of them, going down each column in order

        Expected Results:
        I can click all of them, and they all get queued and downloaded

        Actual Results:
        After the first 5 or so, I start to get a beachball cursor and it becomes difficult to click the remaining songs until the first batch finishes

        Regression:
        I didn’t try this with earlier versions of iTunes
