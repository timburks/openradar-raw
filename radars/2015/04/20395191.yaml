        Summary:
        When creating an app with a WatchKit extension, once should not have to manually change the version and builder number 3 times.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create an app with a WatchKit extension.
        - Update the main appâ€™s target version or build number.
        - Attempt to submit the app to iTunes Connect.

        Expected Results:
        The application and its extensions are accepted, using the version and build number we just set.

        Actual Results:
        Application is rejected for having different versions and/or build numbers. We have to set these 2 constants in THREE different places in the project (3!!): the app target, the watch extension, and the watch app. Failing to do so is only detected when the app is reviewed in iTunes Connect.

        Regression:
        This is a regression compared to other IDEs that actually make sense.
