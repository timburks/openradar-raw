    description: "Summary:\nOpen Documentation and the table of contents shows “No Content” with no indication of how to fix this.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Update Xcode.\n2. Open Help -> Documentation\n3. View the table of contents sidebar.\n4. See “No Content” instead of anything useful.\n5. Also try: right-click and say “Reveal in Library”\n6. Open Xcode preferences -> Download. Note that “Check for and install updates automatically” is checked, and yet *it is not happening*.\n\nExpected Results:\nAt step 4: Ideally, see the actual table of contents that lets me browse/navigate the documentation. If that’s not possible, *at least* see a hint that new documentation is available and must be downloaded. \nAt step 5: See the path to the documentation in the library.\nstep 6: latest results should be downloaded or downloading. Instead Xcode is staring at me dumbly, waiting for it to tell it to do the thing it is supposed to do automatically.\n\nActual Results:\nStep 4: See “No Contents”\nStep 5: nothing. Nothing happens.\nStep 6: Sometimes, eventually, maybe on better wifi, the documentation downloads. What triggers this? No idea. Or maybe that checkbox doesn’t work and I always end up manually downloading. No idea.\n\nRegression:\nI believe all versions of Xcode 6 have suffered from this confluence of bugs and poor behavior. It took me months (and a class or two of students) to figure out what was actually causing the issues. Partly because it does sometimes self-resolve.\n\nNotes:\nThis should maybe be 3 radars, but ain’t nobody got time for that. I’ve got another full class of students to help download documentation manually so they can use Xcode’s help."
