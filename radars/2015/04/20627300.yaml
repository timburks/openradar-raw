        Summary:
        When editing a scheme in two different Xcode projects (such as when copying environment variables between them), performance in Xcode slows to a crawl

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open two different Xcode workspaces
        2. Edit schemes in each, switching to the Environment Variables section for the Run action
        3. Attempt to copy and paste 2 pairs of names and values

        Expected Results:
        Easily able to switch between windows and copy/paste between them

        Actual Results:
        Performance slows to a crawl until one of the scheme editor sheets is closed
