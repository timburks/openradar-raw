    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen loading ASTC textures into Metal, the texture appears upright in the frame debugger (Capture GPU Frame), but vertically flipped when rendered. Other texture formats appear upright both in the debugger and when rendered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app on a Metal-capable iOS device.\r\n2. Select an ASTC texture from the menu (4x4 or 8x8 block size)\r\n3. (Optional) Define MBE_WORKAROUND_INVERTED_ASTC to be 1 to enable a texture matrix that inverts the y axis of the texture coordinate system and results in correct rendering.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nASTC textures render as they appear in the debugger, similar to how other compressed formats render (the sample app includes PVRTC and ETC2 textures for comparison).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nASTC textures appear vertically flipped when rendered."
