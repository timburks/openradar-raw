    description: "Summary:\r\nIn issue #15054553, the engineer pointed out that `ignoreSnapshotOnNextApplicationLaunch` does not, as the documentation says, prevent the snapshot from being taken, but rather merely prevents the snapshot from being used when you launch the app.\r\n\r\nBut, it's important to be able to turn off the screen snapshot being taken at all. If you have confidential information being show, you never want the app to be able to take a screen snapshot.\r\n\r\nClearly, you can respond to app delegate calls and manually obscure confidential information, but this is cumbersome and inefficient. For secure apps, we really need the ability to stop iOS from taking snapshots at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5; iOS 7.1 (11D167); Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5; iOS 7.1 (11D167); Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)"
