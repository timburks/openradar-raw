    description: "Summary:\r\nSince upgrading to 10.10, EVERYTHING is slower.\r\n\r\nTyping, clicking, switching apps, deleting emails. Any activity I can think of has been slowed down so significantly that it's gotten me to write this bug report.\r\n\r\nYou've taken a perfectly good 2.3 GHz MBP Core i7 and turned back the clock on it, perhaps both literally and figuratively.\r\n\r\nMy MHz now Mega Hurts!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boot Yosemite.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor it to be as \"snappy\" as 10.9 or snappier.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPAIN AND SUFFERING.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 (14D131)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNetflix videos now stutter. They didn't used to! When I said *everything*, I literally mean everything.\r\n\r\nApps SBOD frequently. Editing long notes for a task in The Hit List caused it to beach ball. Deleting email causes Mail to SBOD. Sometimes scrolling a webpage causes the browser to SBOD.\r\n\r\nYour users and YOU are suffering. You brought us to paradise and then take us away? That's WORSE than not bringing us there in the first place!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAs mentioned, I've a perfectly good 2.3 GHz Core i7 MBP that was working just fine before upgrading."
