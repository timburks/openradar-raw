    description: Using the keyboardType property on UITextInputTraits, you can change the style of keyboard associated with a text field. Some uses cases of those types, such as UIKeyboardTypeNamePhonePad, would provide better UX if the primary and secondary modes for the keyboard were optionally reversed. With this example, showing the number pad first, allowing the user to tap the ABC button in the bottom left to switch to the secondary mode of the alphabet, rather than the other way around.
