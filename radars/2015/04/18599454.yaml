    description: "https://trac.adium.im/ticket/16827\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nAdium hangs on trying to connect using Bonjour on 10.10. I don't think the bug is actually in Adium, but it *appears* to the casual user that Adium no longer works. If a bonjour account is set to auto-connect on app open, Adium immediately beachballs. The reason I don't think this is Adium's fault is because is actually takes down ALL networking on the machine. \r\nI submitted the following to Apple:\r\nI upgraded to OSX 10.10 and kept noticing that I would have networking for 5-10 minutes max and then it would just stop. I could request DHCP renewals, but nothing else worked. After some trial and error, I tracked the problem down to discoveryd.\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\nStart Adium.app (latest version 1.5.10)\r\nPreferences...\r\nAccounts tab\r\nAdd a Bonjour account (little + icon in the lower left corner)\r\naccept defaults, OK\r\nAdium will try to connect, discoveryd will ramp up to 100% and all networking on the Mac will quickly cease.\r\nRegression\r\n\r\nThis didn't happen with OS X 10.9.5.\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nNetworking fix: killall discoveryd"
