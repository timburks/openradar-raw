    description: "Summary:\r\nOn the current (14D87h) developer seed of 10.10.3, attempting to build a NetRestore image of 10.10.2 using System Image Utility results in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThe Essentials install package component contains a postinstall script that calls update_automator_cache, which seems to continue running in an infinite loop, endlessly caching files on the newly-installed filesystem in the temporary volume. This process must be killed manually in order for the installation to complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download OS X Yosemite (latest at this time is 10.10.2) from the Mac App Store.\r\n2. Open System Image Utility.\r\n3. Select the Install OS X Yosemite (10.10.2, 14C109) source.\r\n4. Select NetRestore image, click Continue.\r\n5. Leave the default settings, create a dummy admin user to allow the process to continue.\r\n6. Choose a target destination for the final output image and start the build.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild would normally complete after some time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA specific postinstall script causes an infinite loop in the installer process.\r\n\r\ncom.apple.pkg.Essentials, running the generateCache postinstall_action. The actual process:\r\n\r\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Automator.framework/Versions/A/Support/update_automator_cache --system --force\r\n\r\n(this is run via `chroot \"$3\"` to run within the root of the volume that's being installed to.)\r\n\r\nThis process seems to continue in an infinite loop. Running `opensnoop` confirms that update_automator_cache is still running and reading through files, but this process never exits.\r\n\r\nKilling the process allows the installation to continue and complete the image build.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3, 14D87h\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've verified this on two different systems running this version of OS X. Please let me know if you'd like any additional information.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTwo systems tested:\r\n27-inch, Late 2012\r\nMac Pro, Early 2008"
