    description: "Summary:\n\nThe version of Xcode that comes in DMGs on the Developer Portal is much bigger than the size of it when downloading via the App Store. Taking 6.3 as example, the difference is 1.4GB (4.0GB vs. 2.6GB). \n\nI have taken a random dylib as an example, and from that it seems this is simply a matter of the amount of debugging symbols being left in. When stripping both dylibs with maximum settings, the result is identical.\n\n```\n+ cp /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Resources/libCGCorePDF.dylib app-store.dylib\n+ cp /Applications/Xcode-6.3.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Resources/libCGCorePDF.dylib dmg.dylib\n+ diff app-store.dylib dmg.dylib\nBinary files app-store.dylib and dmg.dylib differ\n+ strip -S -X -x -c app-store.dylib dmg.dylib\n+ diff app-store.dylib dmg.dylib\n```\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nDownload Xcode from the Developer Portal and from the App Store.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nBoth versions are identical, except for the MAS Receipts.\n\nActual Results:\n\nThe DMG version is massively bigger.\n\nRegression: \n\nSeems to be true for any recent version of Xcode.\n\nNotes: -"
