    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe developer status page does not reflect anything close to reality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Wait for an essential developer resource, such as https://bugereport.apple.com to become unavailable.\r\n2) Load the developer status page at https://developer.apple.com/system-status/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe unavailable resource should be highlighted in red.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere are no reported issues.\r\n\r\nThe attached screenshot “Screen Shot 2015-04-13 at 10.39.14 AM” shows page not loading. The attached screenshot “Screen Shot 2015-04-13 at 10.52.59 AM” shows the status not being updated after more than 10 minutes of downtime.\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-13%20at%2010.39.14%20AM.png\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-13%20at%2010.52.59%20AM.png\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to believe this page is not automated. But the behavior we see every time there’s a problem indicates that that this is the case.\r\n\r\nMake the results on this page update automatically or take this page down. As it is now, it provides no feedback whether the failure is a local network issue or problem with the system.\r\n\r\n————\r\n\r\nEngineering has provided the following regarding this issue:\r\n\r\nThank you for the feedback.\r\n\r\nWe are closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
