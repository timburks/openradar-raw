    description: "When a user toggles an AVPlayerViewController into full-screen mode, it presents a modal view controller of type AVFullScreenViewController (a private class).\r\n\r\nYour app might want to dismiss that presented modal view controller programmatically—for example, if the user opens a URL which your app can handle.\r\n\r\nBut calling `dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:` on the presenting view controller crashes the app with the following exception:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'UIViewControllerHierarchyInconsistency', reason: 'child view controller:<AVEmbeddedPlaybackControlsViewController: 0x7fe49a0aaed0> should have parent view controller:<AVPlayerViewController: 0x7fe499c6fa80> but actual parent is:<AVFullScreenViewController: 0x7fe499c93030>’\r\n\r\nIt seems like the AVPlayerViewController and AVFullScreenViewController collaborate via view controller containment to share some controls, but that collaboration doesn't happen when a developer tries to call `dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:`.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an inline AVPlayerViewController\r\n2. Run the app, and put that player into full-screen mode\r\n3. Call [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil] while the full screen AV player is presented\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe fullscreen player should be dismissed, like any other view controller would be \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app crashes:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'UIViewControllerHierarchyInconsistency', reason: 'child view controller:<AVEmbeddedPlaybackControlsViewController: 0x7fe49a0aaed0> should have parent view controller:<AVPlayerViewController: 0x7fe499c6fa80> but actual parent is:<AVFullScreenViewController: 0x7fe499c93030>’\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 6 Simulator, iPad Air Simulator, physical iPad Air device"
