    description: "Summary:\r\nFrequently when I return to my Mac in the morning after leaving it locked overnight, I find that two processes are each consuming an entire core of my CPU. soagent and callservicesd will each continue to use 100% CPU until I forcibly kill them, SIGTERM is insufficient.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWalk away from my computer for roughly 12 hours. Return.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe fan on my computer is quiet because two processes are not each consuming an entire core of my CPU.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe fans are running at full speed and my computer runs slowly because the CPU is being silently eaten by rogue daemons.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis did not happen in OS X 10.9. This may not have even happened in 10.10.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have had developer releases of 10.10.2 on this machine, if some configuration left over is a factor. As far as I have been able to find, there is no logging or other debugging information being written by these processes which would help identify the error state theyâ€™ve gotten in to."
