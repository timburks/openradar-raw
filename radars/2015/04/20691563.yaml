    description: "Summary:\r\nAlerts for Mail delivered while an iPhone is unlocked always announce as \"Loading\", in perpetuity, and never update to show the email preview text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On iOS, use Settings > Notification Centre to switch on Mail notifications as alerts, with 5 preview lines.\r\n\r\n2. Turn on VoiceOver on the device.\r\n\r\n3. Receive some mail on the account associated with the iOS device for which you configured alert notifications with VoiceOver running.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification text should include the sender, subject and message preview.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Loading\" is announced, and nothing seems to provoke VoiceOver to update its view of the notification to include subject or text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWas not a problem in iOS 7. The account is an iCloud account.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8.3 on iPhone 6 Plus."
