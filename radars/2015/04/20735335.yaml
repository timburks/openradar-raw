        Summary:
        Please add menu commands to the iOS Simulator to simulate loss of network connectivity. This is a frequent occurrence in the real world, and any networked app needs to deal with loss of signal and monitor reachability of servers. Currently the only way to simulate this that I’ve found is to turn off the host Mac’s networking (i.e. disable WiFi or unplug Ethernet) which is pretty disruptive to everything else on the computer.

        The simulator already has a number of commands to test uncommonly-needed occurrences like geo location changes or iCloud sync. So I was surprised that there isn’t anything available to test basic networking. The Preferences app is even missing an Airplane Mode toggle!

        (It would be even cooler if the functionality of the Network Link Conditioner were rolled into the Simulator, so one could try the simulated app at 3G bandwidth. Again, I can do this by running the Conditioner system pref on my Mac, but then it slows down everything else too.)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        N/A

        Actual Results:
        N/A
