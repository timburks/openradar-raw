    description: 'Swift’s PermutationGenerator is misleadingly named. It''s not about permutation at all. It''s just indexing collection with an index sequence. It should be named something else and Swift should offer a real permutation generator like this: https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations.'
