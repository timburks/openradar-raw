    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen geocoding an address the street address should be used for returning matching place marks. But if the street address has additional numbers - separated by slash - it is using these numbers instead of the street number.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the provided sample app on iPhone 6 simulator\r\n2. The green pins are where the addresses should be\r\n3. The red pins are the erroneous responses\r\n4. Tap on the pins to see the returned address\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Rinnböckstrasse 48/17 should show the pin at street number 48\r\n- Rosa-Jochmann-Ring 42/4/5/30 should show the pin at street number 42\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Rinnböckstrasse 48/17 shows the pin at street number 17\r\n- Rosa-Jochmann-Ring 42/4/5/30 shows pin at street number 5\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 6.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWarning: Some addresses in large apartment complexes consisting of multiple objects (in Austria) might have an object number at the second place. 42/1/3/13 and 42/2/3/13 would then be at distinct locations.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mentioned sample app is the GeoCorderBug project at https://github.com/Cocoanetics/RadarSamples"
