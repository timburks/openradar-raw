    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I have two devices (one iPhone 6+, one iPad Air) connected to my computer at one time, and I run unit tests on the physical device, Xcode will run the unit test on the device in question, but will change the selected device in Xcode to be the other device. So if I run test again, if I'm not careful, it will run on the other device. And when doing benchmarking with `measureBlock`, it's important to stay on the particular device in question.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Hook up two devices to computer.\r\n2. Unit test on one device.\r\n3. Watch Xcode change from one device to the other.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDon't change from one device to the other.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanges from one device to the other.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3 (6D570)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode Version 6.3 (6D570)\r\nMac OS X 10.10.3 (14D131)\r\niOS 8.3 (12F69) on iPad Air\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70) on iPhone 6+"
