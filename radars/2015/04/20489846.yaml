    description: "Summary:\r\nConfigure an NSURLSession with an NSURLSessionConfiguration that has an explicit HTTPAdditionalHeaders property that specifies a Content-type of application/json. Use that session to produce a data task, then subsequently resume that task so the HTTP request is made. The request will be made with a Content-type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and the HTTPBody will also be form-encoded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe following steps are relative to the ViewController.m file in the sample project.\r\n\r\n1. Configure a default NSURLSessionConfiguration (line 20)\r\n2. Specify HTTPAdditionalHeaders with a Content-type of application/json (line 21)\r\n3. Create an NSMutableURLRequest (line 34)\r\n4. Specify POST as the HTTPMethod (line 35)\r\n5. Specify an HTTPBody  that contains JSON data (line 36)\r\n6. Create a data task with the request (line 38)\r\n7. Resume the task (line 46)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the request to be POSTed with a Content-type header of application/json and the HTTPBody to not be form encoded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe request was POSTed as application/x-www-form-urlencoded and the HTTPBody was form encoded. I know this because I ran the device through mitmproxy. It produced the following request:\r\n\r\n2015-04-09 16:36:17 POST http://www.example.com/\r\n\r\nHost:              www.example.com\r\nContent-Type:      application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nConnection:        keep-alive\r\nProxy-Connection:  keep-alive\r\nAccept:            */*\r\nUser-Agent:        HTTPContentType/1 CFNetwork/711.3.18 Darwin/14.0.0\r\nAccept-Language:   en-us\r\nContent-Length:    120\r\nAccept-Encoding:   gzip, deflate\r\nURLEncoded form\r\n{                               \r\n  \"quote\" : \"Once an SDK has    \r\nbeen expanded by a code         \r\nmodification, it will never     \r\nreturn to its original          \r\ndimensions.\"                    \r\n}:           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe iOS 8.3 documentation for NSURLSessionConfiguration.HTTPAdditionalHeaders does not indicate that the Content-type header should be avoided. This worked in previous versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ 64 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'HTTPContentType.zip' was successfully uploaded."
