    description: "Summary:\nWhen creating an app with a WatchKit extension with Swift, Xcode automatically sets EMBEDDED_CONTENT_CONTAINS_SWIFT to \n“Yes” for Swift projects. That makes sense, because the target **does** contain Swift code. The problem however is that iTunes Connect rejects this binary because the extension contains a “Frameworks” folder. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nCreate a Swift app with an Apple Watch extension. Archive and submit to iTunes Connect.\n\nExpected Results:\nApp is accepted.\n\nActual Results:\niTunes Connects rejects binary with the error “The bundle ___WatchKit___.appex contains disallowed file \"Frameworks”.\n\nRegression:\nUnintuitively, changing that setting to “No” fixes the problem.\n\nNotes:\nWhy would one have to make EMBEDDED_CONTENT_CONTAINS_SWIFT “No” for a target that contains Swift code? Why would we have to know about implementation details of the IDE? Xcode should just understand what the targets are, and figure out what the internal structure of the IPA needs to be for an app. That shouldn’t be the responsibility of a developer, specially not without more helpful messages than “The bundle ___WatchKit___.appex contains disallowed file \"Frameworks”."
