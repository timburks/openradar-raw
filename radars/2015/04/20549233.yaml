    description: "Summary:\r\nUITableViewController calls [super init] inside initWithStyle:. This breaks the designated initializer chain and prevents subclasses from blocking e.g. initWithNibName:bundle: from being called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUITableViewController should call [super initWithNibName:bundle:] inside initWithStyle:.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUITableViewController calls [super init] inside initWithStyle:, which then calls [self initWithNibName:bundle:]. This results in the overridden [self initWithNibName:bundle:] being called, which might be overridden to prevent direct calls to it, resulting in a crash/assertion.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has always been a bug but with the SDK 8.3 changes has become more visible.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2015/uitableviewcontroller-designated-initializer-woes/ for details.\r\n\r\nNo sample project necessary, but since I know that there are people pushing back if there is no code attached to a radar, Iâ€™ve added a simple Sample project that asserts when running - but should work correctly if thus bug is fixed."
