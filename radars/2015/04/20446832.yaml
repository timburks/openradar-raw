        Summary:
        When slicing images from the Asset Catalog and setting one inset at 0 (bottom in my case), Interface Builder previewed the correct result, but the results were incorrect in iOS.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Setup slicing in the Asset Catalog with bottom inset at 0.

        Expected Results:
        The image should be rendered in the simulator in the same way as in Interface Builder.

        Actual Results:
        The iOS rendering is wrong.
