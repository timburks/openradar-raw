        Summary:
        It would be nice if from the Git Commit sheet you could right click on files and directories, with the option to ignore them. Many Git integrations (such as Tortoise) offer this. Right clicking on a file would offer to ignore File.name, as well as *.name, and choosing either would update the .gitignore file behind the scenes
