    description: "Summary:\r\nI always have my Xcode assistant editor open with counterparts option. It's very handy to have an *.m file opened at standard editor while having corresponding *.h file in assistant editor.\r\n\r\nAfter recent update to version 6.3 Xcode started to show random instead of corresponding headers quite often. Several clicks to \"four squares\" icon and mode usually brings it back (but it's very annoying).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nShow assistant editor and set \"counterparts\" option\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen I click on *.m file in project navigator, Xcode shows *.m file in main editor and corresponding *.h file in assistant editor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt works for some time, but then Xcode changes assistant editor \"counterparts\" option to \"manual\" so assistant editor no longer shows corresponding header. It happens about 10-20 times per day.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\nThe issue appeared only after update to Xcode 6.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSeveral other users confirmed they see the bug too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29639866/xcode-6-3-shows-random-files-instead-of-counterparts-in-assistant-editor\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI haven't noticed any patterns about when and how it's happening\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
