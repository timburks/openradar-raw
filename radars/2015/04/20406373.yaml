    description: "Summary:\r\nThe initializer for CBMutableCharacteristic takes a properties parameter of type CBCharacteristicProperties. It is possible to pass a single value, or to pass multiple values using the bitwise OR operator.\r\n\r\nUsing Swift on the iOS platform, this works as expected. However, using Swift on the OS X platform, it is not possible to pass multiple values for the properties parameter.\r\n\r\nOn OS X, CBCharacteristicProperties is implemented as an enum. Therefore, it is possible to use the bitwise OR operator on its values.\r\n\r\nThe attached screenshot shows that CBCharacteristicProperties uses a different construct between iOS and OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLike on iOS, CBCharacteristicProperties on OS X should be implemented as a struct that adopts RawOptionSetType.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCBCharacteristicProperties on OS X is an enum that does not allow the bitwise OR \"|\" operator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2\r\niOS 8.2\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/29420894/swift-enum-and-cbcharacteristicproperties\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9cefa3s3agss6vn/CBCharacteristicProperties.png?dl=0"
