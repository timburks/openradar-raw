    description: "When importing a module that contains a type with the same name as the framework, it’s impossible to use the module name to select a shadowed type within the module via namespacing. \r\n\r\nThe attached project shows this in action: it defines a framework titled “NameConflictTest” that declares two types: “NameConflictTest” and “A”. The included playground imports the “NameConflictTest” module and creates an instance of the type with the same name. It then declares a new type with the name “A” that overrides the imported “A” type. There is no longer any way to reference the imported “A” type.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached project, NameConflictTest\r\n2. Open the included Playground as part of the project\r\n3. Uncomment the last line\r\n\r\nIt should create a new instance of type A, as declared within the NameConflictTest framework\r\n\r\nInstead, it gives an error: ‘NameConflictTest.Type’ does not have a member named ‘A’."
