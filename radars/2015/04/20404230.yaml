    description: "Summary:\r\nMethod -[NSString(NSURLUtilities) stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters:] has a stack overflow issue, which can be reproduced with some strings containing hieroglyphs. In these cases __stack_chk_fail will abort the application when building for arm64 architectire, and stack will be corrupted when building for armv7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download sample from https://github.com/PavelTretyakov/nsstring-crash\r\n2. Run the application (under release configuration, on armv7 in debug it may corrupt stack without a crash)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTest functions working with strings complete correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 (12D508)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApplication contains 2 test functions. In the first case I stumbled myself, and the second was found while googling for the problem. These tests has a different impact on the stack, and the first one may corrupt data without an immediate crash on armv7.\r\n\r\nFunction CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes performs escaping without crashes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'test.crash' was successfully uploaded."
