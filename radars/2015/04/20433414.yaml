        Summary:
        When clicking on the iOS Simulator’s Apple Watch external display, clicks appear as clicks on the main screen in the accessibility inspector, highlighting elements and the like.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the iOS Simulator and enable the Accessibility Inspector.
        2. Open an Apple Watch external display.
        3. Click around on the watch screen.

        Expected Results:
        Ideally, we’d see VoiceOver information for the watch UI.

        Actual Results:
        The Accessibility Inspector on the iPhone screen activates with controls on that screen.

        Regression:
        Unknown.

        Notes:
