        Summary:
        I have a bunch of source files (XIBs) that were not members of a target and want to add them to the same targets, and have to do it explicitly for each file.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Select 25 XIB files in the project navigator.
        - Switch to the File Inspector

        Expected Results:
        The File Inspector should show the "Target membership" section. The files are all XIBs after all, so eligible for adding. I should be able to just check one particular target's checkmark to add all 25 XIBs to this one target.

        Actual Results:
        The "Target membership" section is missing. It is only visible when I select a single file. I have to manually select each file, switch to the File Inspector again and tick the checkbox there (which takes quite a while to react, too).

        Please fix this, thanks.
