    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode slowly crashes when navigating away from a storyboard. Everything within the storyboard appears to work correctly, however, as soon as another file is selected in the navigator, or certain other actions are performed, the application spins indefinitely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open a .storyboard file. The file being tested includes:\r\n- Designable objects with configured properties\r\n- Multiple scenes with segues\r\n- Fairly complex auto layout constraints\r\n2) Select a different file (reproducible at least with source files, project files, asset catalogs, or resource)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode will display the selected file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode shows a spinning beachball indefinitely.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem was not observed before upgrading to Xcode 6.3. No other obvious changes were made to the project, files used, or workflow when this problem began.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFollowing this note: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29542356/xcode-6-3-crashes-when-navigating-from-storyboard-to-other-swift-1-2-file Commenting out all IB_DESIGNABLEâ€™s across the project (using a different editor, obviously) appears to circumvent this issue."
