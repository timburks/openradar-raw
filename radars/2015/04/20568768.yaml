    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter writing video files using using AVAssetWriter, sometimes no image can be generated from the resulting video file when using AVAssetImageGenerator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open project containing sample video\r\n2. Run sample project\r\n3. Observe error when trying to create a snapshot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn image is generated at time = 0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo image is generated and a \"Cannot open\" error is returned.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 doesn't show a snapshot of the video file, either. I assume that it uses the same method to generate.\r\n\r\nffmpeg has no problem generating a screenshot at time = 0 by using the following on the command line: \r\n\r\n`ffmpeg -ss 00:00:00 -i Video.mp4 -f mjpeg screen.png`\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AVAssetImageGeneratorBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
