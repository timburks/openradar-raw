    description: "Summary: Startup disk becomes unset post install of Yosemite Recovery HD update\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. 10.10.2 machine is offered 10.10.3 and recovery update\r\n2. Machine is encrypted and firmware password is in effect\r\n3. Run Yosemite Recovery HD update alone\r\n4. run systemsetup -getstartupdisk\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncommand should return ‘/System/Library/CoreServices’\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo output, and upon reboot there is the flashing ‘question mark on folder’ animation, indicating no bootable OS was found, since searching for a bootable startup disk is disabled by applying the firmware password, as it also affects Target Disk Mode, and Netboot\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nhard to correlate if just FV2 or just firmware passwords or just certain hardware models cause the failure state, can say that 2013+2014 MBAirs and RetinaiMacs with both FV2 & firmwarepass have been affected so far\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAffected install count: 423 Macs at Montefiore Medical Center, NY, more at affiliated Albert Einstein School of Medicine"
