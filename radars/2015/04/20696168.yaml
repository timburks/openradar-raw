        Summary:
        Sometimes bugreport.apple.com is down and unavailable from multiple IPs but the status report page says everything is green. Itâ€™s obviously impossible to file this issue while the problem is exhibited. Is there a support email or twitter handle that could be reached when it is happening next?
