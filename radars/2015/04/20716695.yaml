    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently in the Apple Watch app on my iPhone, I can edit which notifications I'd like to see on my Watch. However, it would be more useful if I could determine a time range that I want to see notifications from a particular app on my Watch (like Do Not Disturb but for a particular app).\r\n\r\nFor instance, I have my personal Gmail account set up on the third-party app Mailbox. During the work day, I don't want to see any emails sent to my personal Gmail on my Watch because I don't want to be disturbed during my work day by personal email. However, I'd like to start seeing these notifications as soon as I get off work. \r\n\r\nIt's a hassle to have to toggle this on and off every day; I'd like the Apple Watch app to allow me to schedule things like this\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Watch app\r\n2. Select Notifications\r\n3. Select specific app, e.g. Mailbox\r\n4. Set a Do Not Disturb range for particular times and particular days (e.g. Mon-Fri I don't want to see Mailbox notifications on my Watch from 9-5)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to select a time range that a particular app's notifications don't disturb me\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp-specific notifications on the Watch are currently all or nothing - I either get them or I don't\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a"
