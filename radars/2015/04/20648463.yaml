    description: "Summary:\r\nI wrote a Swift method:\r\n\r\nfunc scheduleLocalNotificationForArrivalTime(arrivalTime: Int, routeName: String, stopName: String, fromViewController viewController: UIViewController) {}\r\n\r\nIn my test bundle, I tried to exercise this function by calling it with the following:\r\n\r\nscheduleLocalNotificationForArrivalTime(4, \"Black Route\", \"Branscomb Quad\", nil)\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to build this, I got the attached error. It took me around a half hour to realize it was because I hadn't declared the viewController parameter as an optional. I couldn't understand why this wouldn't compile; the argument list seemed exactly as I defined it and exactly as I was calling it. \r\n\r\nXcode could provide a much more helpful error message, like \"cannot pass nil value into non-optional parameter\". That would have allowed me to instantly realize what the problem was.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write method with no optional parameters\r\n2. Call the method, and try to pass nil into one of the parameters\r\n3. See attached error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA helpful error message when I try to pass nil into a non-optional parameter\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA very vague error message when I try to pass nil into a non-optional parameter\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.1, OS X 10.10.3"
