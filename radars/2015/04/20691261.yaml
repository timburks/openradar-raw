    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen updating apps via the Mac App store, the download and installation status shows up only briefly, then disappears.  Switching to the Purchases tab, then back to Updates will again show the download and installation status, before it disappears again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) In the Updates tab, update an application from the Mac App store, like Xcode\r\n2) Download will start, and status is displayed briefly, then the button goes back to Update, and the status disappears\r\n3) Switch to Purchases tab, then switch back to Updates tab\r\n4) Download/installation status of the application will be shown, and then it will revert back to Update again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected behavior is to see the download/install progress of the update at all times when in the Updates tab\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDownload/install progress is only shown briefly before it reverts back to the “Update” status, which is incorrect because an update is currently occuring.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a video recording of this behavior."
