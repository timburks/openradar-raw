    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter configuring an app to use the \"audio\" background mode, an app streaming video content to an Apple TV using native AirPlay, will still have the playback interrupted when the app enters the background, e.g. because the user taps the Home button or because the idle timer runs out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure app to use the \"audio\" Background Mode\r\n2. Make sure the app's device and an Apple TV is on the same WiFi\r\n3. Play streaming video content using the MPMoviePlayerController class\r\n4. Drag the Control Center up and activate AirPlay\r\n5. Wait for the video content to start playing on the Apple TV\r\n6. Press the Home button, making the app go into the background\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVideo content continues playing on Apple TV using AirPlay.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo playback is occasionally interrupted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device capable of running iOS 8 and a 3rd generation Apple TV\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
