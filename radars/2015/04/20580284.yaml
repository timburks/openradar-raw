    description: "Summary:\r\nPublic betas expire in 30 days, but if a developer is busy and not paying close attention that 30 days can lapse without warning, shutting testers out of their betas.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a public beta and distribute it\r\n2. Wait 30 days\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDeveloper gets a heads-up email a week before and maybe even a chance to extend the beta.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo heads-up is sent and testers are locked out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
