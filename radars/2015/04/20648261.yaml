    description: "Summary:\r\nWith every update of Xcode, the simulator disappears from my dock. I have to put it back manually. Not a biggie, but if Xcode can stay in my dock, why can’t the simulator’s icon? Even the Instruments icon stays there nicely!\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. make sure both Xcode and simulator icons are in your dock\r\n2. download new version of Xcode\r\n3. install new version of Xcode\r\n4. find your simulator icon has disappeared\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the simulator icon to be still there (well, honestly, I expected it to disappear, as it disappeared with installing all previous versions, but it shouldn’t)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsee step 4, simulator icon disappeared from dock. On first run you can put it back manually.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nit occurs when upgrading from 6.3 to 6.3.1 for sure, but I’m pretty certain it happened in earlier versions too\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nit’s easy to workaround, just place the icon back at the dock. But it would be even easier if it wouldn’t disappear. ;-)"
