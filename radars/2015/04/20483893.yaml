        Summary:
        If you have an update to OS X available, as well as an update that requires the new version (in this case, Server), you can’t click Update All, or else the Mac App Store prompts you to download an earlier version of Server that’s compatible with your current OS. It would be nice if it could batch them together and install the new Server version as part of the OS X upgrade, so you don’t need to go back to the App Store again after installing the first update
