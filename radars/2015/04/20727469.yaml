        Summary:
        The Connections instrument can’t be used to record an entire run (or just the startup of) an application. Apparently it only works when attached to an already-running application. This is a blocker for me because the behavior I’m trying to profile occurs at launch time.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Xcode I choose Product>Profile (Cmd-I)
        2. In Instruments I select the Time Profiler template, and a new window opens
        3. I open the library and drag the Connections template into the instrument list
        4. I press Record

        Expected Results:
        Instruments launches the app and starts recording, as normal

        Actual Results:
        Instruments pops up a “Choose Target for Connections” alert. My application is _not_ in the list. There is no way to proceed without choosing an app, so I can’t profile the app’s startup.
