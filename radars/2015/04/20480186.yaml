        Summary:
        When we declare the new protocol and some properties in protocol. their getter and setter must have the same access control to the protocol itself. I think it would be great if we can make their setter be lower access love.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Declare a new protocol

        public protocol Data {
          var id: String { get internal(set) }
        }

        Expected Results:
        Swift can compile with expected behavior in Framework.

        Actual Results:
        Compiler failed

        Regression:
