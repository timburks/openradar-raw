        Summary:
        It’s impossible to use the Dispatch instrument: adding it to the instrument list disables the Record button, so no data can be recorded. There is no UI feedback other than the disabled button so I have absolutely no idea what the underlying issue is.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open my iOS app project in Xcode and choose Product>Profile (Cmd-I)
        2. In Instruments I select the Time Profiler template
        3. I open the library and drag the Dispatch template into the instrument list
        4. I press the Record button

        Expected Results:
        Instruments launches the app and starts recording data

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens because the Record button is now disabled (after step 3)

        Notes:
        Removing the Dispatch instrument re-enables the Record button. It appears Instruments has decided I’ve created a state in which I can’t record, but there is absolutely no indication of why this happened or how to correct it.
