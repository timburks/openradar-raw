        Summary:
        There’s currently no way to view custom log files written by integration triggers or scheme actions once a build completes, or to produce custom artifacts for download

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a

        Expected Results:
        Writing files with the .log extension to the $XCS_OUTPUT_DIR directory should be persisted and downloadable with the Download All Logs button. Writing other files (perhaps to a specific directory or via some other mechanism) should add custom files to the Build Results, that could be downloaded the same as the product or archive

        Actual Results:
        Files written to $XCS_OUTPUT_DIR don’t make it to the integration directory when the build completes
