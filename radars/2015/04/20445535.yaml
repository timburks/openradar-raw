    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a multi-screen setup with the monitors side by side, the Dock can be moved to the bottom of a screen by moving the mouse to the bottom of the screen. Unfortunately this behavior makes the Dock move screens when it's not desired.\r\n\r\nPlease make it possible to pin the Dock to the bottom of a specific screen and prevent it from moving screens if the user places their mouse at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a setting to pin the Dock to a specific screen, or at least prevent it from being moved by the user moving their cursor to the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such setting exists. The undesired movement of the Dock significantly degrades usability, especially with apps such as Xcode which already have poorly-designed UI elements (such as the panel for choosing a location to save a new project) that extend past the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.2 (14C1514)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2013 Mac Pro, two displays side-by-side, left display is a 4K HiDPI monitor and the right display is a conventional 1080p resolution display. \"Displays have separate spaces\" is enabled in Mission Control settings."
