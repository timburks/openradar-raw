        Summary:
        Changing version or build number of a project is a big hassle at the moment, as you can’t just type the version or build number, because the text fields lose focus after each typed key.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Select project in sidebar, go to a target, open the „General“ tab and select the „Version“ or „Build“ text field. After each key stroke, the text field loses focus and needs to be re-klicked again.

        Expected Results:
        You can simply change both values.

        Actual Results:
        You need to klick on those text fields after each key stroke.

        Regression:
