        Xcode 6.3 systematically crashes when archiving the app from Xcode UI (Build > Archive)

        From this discussion:
        https://devforums.apple.com/message/1123316#1123316

        It appears this is linked to SCM.

        Our Xcode workspace has this structure:

        Workspace (Mercurial)
        	Project A (Mercurial)
        	Project B (GIT)
        	Project C (Mercurial)	

        Disabling SCM from Xcode prefs solves the issue.

        HTH.
