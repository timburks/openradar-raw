    description: "Summary:\r\nAt present, creating a copy of a Bot requires a lot of copy-and-paste, making it time consuming and error-prone. Add a menu item (Main Menu or a context-menu item when context-clicking a Bot) to “Duplicate Bot”, which pre-fills the fields of the new Bot based on the one you’re duplicating. This should probably not duplicate the credentials.\r\n\r\nThis would make it so much easier to have Prod/Beta bots, or to make a new bot for a different branch."
