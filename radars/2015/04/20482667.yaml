    description: "Summary:\r\nUITextViews allow using some built-in shortcuts. For instance, one can move to the beginning/end of a line using command-left/right. However, these shortcuts only work partially.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n- Move to the beginning of a line. Command-right works fine. However, command-left doesn't work, although it should.\r\n- Command-down/up works at the very end of lines, although it should not if apps want to be consistent with the default selection behavior on Mac or with the selection behavior of Notes.app, etc.\r\n- Move to the end of a paragraph using option-down. Then type a character. Notice that it's added in a new paragraph instead of the old one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project on an actual iPad.\r\n2. Connect an external keyboard to test keyboard shortcuts\r\n3. Try the above examples.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selection behavior should be consistent with Mac apps and built-in apps such as Notes.app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSelection behavior is erroneous (see description)"
