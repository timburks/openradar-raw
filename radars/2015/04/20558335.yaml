        Summary:
        The swift compiler is giving an error that it cannot override ‘init’ which has been marked unavailable, in a file that does not actually declare any overrides nor initializers.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) git clone https://github.com/segiddins/realm-cocoa.git —branch seg-init-override-error —depth 1
        2) open Realm.xcodeproj
        3) cmd-U

        Expected Results:
        The tests should compile and run.

        Actual Results:
        The swift compiler gives an error: `cannot override ‘init’ which has been marked unavailable`, and does not point to a line of source that has caused this error.
