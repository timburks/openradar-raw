    description: "Summary:\r\nFor those that need or prefer it, please support the development and use of alternative formant synthesisers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe only voices shipped with or available for OS X are concatenative (except MacinTalk, which is less distinct than other synthesisers).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFormant synthesis should be available for OS X from third-parties; developers should be able to make bindings for those that are already available as Open Source. Documentation for TTS authors should be available (not just for consumers of the speech platform for converting text into speech).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no formant synthesisers available for the OS X speech platform. Some Open Source synthesisers are available, but they are not usable by applications on the platform because they are not integrated with the speech platform APIs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEloquence, DECtalk and eSpeak are still popular on Windows; I prefer and use the former, even though it appears to be dying.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis was unsupported since the outset of OS X and iOS."
