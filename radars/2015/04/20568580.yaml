        - Have your Mac set to require a password on wake-from-sleep.
        - Wake it, e.g. by pressing the command key.
        - As soon as the password field comes up, start typing.
        - Hit return to confirm

        Expected Results:
        Given I typed my password correctly, it should log me in.

        Actual Results:
        I get the "wrong password" shake feedback. If you examine the number of bullets in the field, you see that it missed about 3 characters.

        Regression:
        This used to work fine on 10.6 and before, IIRC. Definitely on 10.2.
