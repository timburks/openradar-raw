    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a person unregisters from iMessage, group conversations are still sent through iMessage and are never received by the person who unregistered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Activate three iPhones. (Call them Alan, Betty, and Charlie's phones.)\r\n2. Start a group iMessage from one to the other two.\r\n3. Deactivate iMessage on Alan's iPhone.\r\n4. Move Alan's SIM card to an Android phone.\r\n5. Send a message from Betty's phone to the group thread.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the message to be delivered to the recipients over SMS (green bubbles) since Alan no longer uses iMessage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTo Betty, the message appears to be sent successfully.\r\n\r\nCharlie receives the message because he has iMessage.\r\n\r\nAlan is never notified of the message because he only has SMS and the message was sent over iMessage.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThis issue persists with all devices running the latest version of iOS.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIndividual (non-group) conversations revert to SMS as expected.\r\n\r\nIf Betty deletes the entire group thread and starts a new one, it will send over SMS as expected. However, when Charlie replies to Betty's message, it will be sent over iMessage and won't be received by Alan. Also, once Charlie sends this reply, Betty's thread will switch back over to iMessage, and future messages won't be received by Alan.\r\n\r\nThe only way to resolve this issue is for Betty and Charlie to both delete their group threads with Alan, and then start a new one.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis issue persists with all devices running the latest version of iOS."
