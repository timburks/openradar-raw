        Xcode always show the following error (not only on the first run):

        “Application data package not copied to the Simulator
        It appears you are running 'CURFER.app' on the iPhone 6 Plus Simulator for the first time, and therefore do not yet have a data folder created.  The application data package will be installed the next time you run your app in the Simulator.”

        Expected:

        Xcode copies the data to the app and the runs with using it.
