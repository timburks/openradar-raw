        Summary:
        We have a set of shared UI elements using IB-Designable and IBInspectable to facilitate configuration in storyboard (see Pods/LBStyledLabel/LBSyledLabel/LBStyledLabel.h ) In past versions of Xcode there has always been an error:
        https://www.dropbox.com/s/z4unitiv5mkvosp/Screenshot%202015-04-20%2012.31.54.png?dl=0

        However, in the most recent version of Xcode 6.3, once you navigate to a storyboard that included any of those elements, it hangs forever.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open external-IB.xcworkspace
        2. navigate to Main.storyboard
        3. Xcode hangs when trying to navigate away from the storyboard

        Expected Results:
        Xcode loads IB-Designable properly

        Actual Results:
        Xcode hangs.



        Regression:
        Before 6.3 Xcode didn’t hang, it just didn’t render the designable as expected
