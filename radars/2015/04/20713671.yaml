        Summary:
        After upgrading to the latest (6.3.1) version of Xcode, the Xcode Server stops working.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        At the moment it isn’t reproducible anymore, because I made a few things. Before that these steps has been done:
        • installed the new version of Xcode on my Mac mini server
        • Xcode server stopped
        • I selected the new Xcode in the Server app
        • Server.app came up immediately with an error saying me that "This version of Xcode cannot be used with OS X Server." (see my tweet with screenshot: https://twitter.com/TheCocoaNaut/status/591539457301598208)

        Expected Results:
        Xcode server should accept this Xcode version.

        Actual Results:
        Got an error message.

        Notes:
        Just after repairing the permissions on my volume and rebooted the Mac mini the Server.app accepted the newly installed Xcode version.
