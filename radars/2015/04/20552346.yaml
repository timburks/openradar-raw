    description: "There are APIs (such as the Apple Notification Center Service) in iOS that allow Bluetooth accessories to receive SMS. I would like to request an API to allow Bluetooth accessories to send outgoing SMS.\n\nThe API should allow the Bluetooth device to specify the text to send, along with the recipient's phone number. If the phone number supports iMessage, the message should be sent via iMessage automatically. \n\nThis API should be available for use by Bluetooth devices (I don't mind if it's via Core Bluetooth or if it requires a Made for iPhone accessory), and thus should not require any user interaction on the phone in order to send SMS. In terms of security, there could be a toggle switch in the Bluetooth settings screen, \"Allow this device to send SMS\".\n\nMy use case is for a third party smartwatch to be able to offer a feature of allowing the user to reply to messages on the watch (whether via pre-written replies or via speech-to-text). \n\nThis is related to rdar://20325202, which was closed as \"3rd party to Resolve\". This current Radar is a request for the appropriate APIs in order to facilitate such a feature."
