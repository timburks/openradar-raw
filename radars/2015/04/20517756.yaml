        Summary:

        Generic classes can contain properties which are subclasses of UIView, but not expose them to interface builder with the @IBOutlet attribute. The compiler complains that properties in generic classes are not visible to Objective-C (which is correct, but itâ€™s still a limitation in this case which should be removed - generic classes should support interface builder to the extent they can).

        To Reproduce:

        import UIKit

        class AView<T> : UIView
        {
        	@IBOutlet var imageView : UIImageView! = nil
        }
