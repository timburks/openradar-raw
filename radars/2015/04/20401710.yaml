    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd like to be able to specify different taptic patterns for different notifications that come to my app. The patterns can be predefined, and the means of selecting them could be either in code or in the notification payload.\r\n\r\nThe use case is a user knowing how important the notification is without having to look at the watch â€” similar to the different tap pattern for turning left vs. turning right with turn-by-turn directions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user feels a different taptic pattern for different notifications in the same app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch"
