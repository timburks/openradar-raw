    description: "libcrypto seems to be missing the symbol _MD5_Transform.  This causes the openssl 0.9.8 library to break, which means any app relying on that library also breaks.\r\n\r\nThis breakage was introduced by the update from 10.10.2 to 10.10.3.  I can confirm this because I was using an app (X-Chat Azure) that relies on openssl.\r\n\r\nExample showing the problem:\r\n\r\nMacintosh-8:~ akkornel$ openssl version\r\ndyld: Symbol not found: _MD5_Transform\r\n  Referenced from: /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.8.dylib\r\n  Expected in: /usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.8.dylib\r\n in /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.8.dylib\r\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\r\n\r\nThis also breaks XChat Azure (org.3rddev.xchatazure) and Colloquy (info.colloquy), among other apps.  You can find the crash reports with my anonymous UUID: [redacted]."
