        Summary:
        It takes an obscene amount of time for builds to complete, and while they’re running, it looks like the build process is taking almost none of the machine’s CPU capacity.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Trigger a moderately complex build from a Bot, even without analysis turned on

        Expected Results:
        Double-digit CPU usage, and a build that completes reasonably quickly, possibly even with a slider in the Server app that allows you to set how much of the machine’s RAM and CPU a build can consume

        Actual Results:
        The build crawls, taking over 10 times longer than builds performed directly in Xcode on the same machine.

        Notes:
        This is on an older Core 2 Duo iMac, to which I had initially attributed the slow build times, but it’s slower than it should be, even on that hardware.
