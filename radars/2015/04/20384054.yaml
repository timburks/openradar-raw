    description: "Summary:\r\nUITextField has a convenient property adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth, which causes the field to shrink its text until it either fits in the field or hits the field's minimumFontSize. This property is documented to shrink the field's text along its baseline.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the field is right-aligned, the text does not shrink along the baseline; instead, it gradually moves up in the field as it shrinks, despite the baseline (as exposed to Auto Layout) staying in the same place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app on an iPhone 4s. Note the placeholder text is aligned with the leading \"Name\" label.\r\n2. Tap in the field and type \"this text is aligned\". Note the text is still aligned with the label.\r\n3. Continue typing, adding the phrase \"until it has to start shrinking to fit\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text remains baseline-aligned with the leading \"Name\" label, but shrinks to its minimum font size of 10pts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text shrinks to its minimum size, but moves up in the field, causing a visual misalignment between the label and the field.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 beta 4 (12F61a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4s Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TextFieldFontAdjustmentTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
