    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice if instead of having to specify `private` or `internal` for every property in Swift I could lump them into a block.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  // public by default\r\n  var repeatCount = 3\r\n  private {\r\n    let maxRepeatCount = 100\r\n    var secretMessage = \"you can't change this\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nInstead of having to write,\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  // public by default\r\n  var repeatCount = 3\r\n  private let maxRepeatCount = 100\r\n  private var secretMessage = \"you can't change this\"\r\n ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create any Swift class/struct.\r\n2. Create some private properties\r\n3. Notice each one has to begin with `private`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI could lump all `private` properties into a block of some kind \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to type `private` before each property"
