    description: "Summary:\nA few times a minute during use (use is defined as hand in contact with one of the devices) there will be easily perceptible lag between my input and what is rendered on the screen. The distance of the cursor jump when the computer tries to catch up when there is lag ranges from between 10 and a few thousand pixels. Less frequently, about once every 10+ minutes, the connection will drop entirely. The modal letting me know the connection was lost will display, and I must wait about 10-30 seconds for the device to automatically reconnect.\n\nLess frequently \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Pair an Apple branded Bluetooth device with an Apple computer running 10.10.3\n2. Use the device.\n\nExpected Results:\nThere would be no lag.\n\nActual Results:\nThere is frequent, sometimes severe lag. Occasionally (about once every 10-15 minutes) the connection with the device is lost for about 10 seconds before it is re-established.\n\nRegression:\nThis did not occur in the same physical environment with the same number of other Bluetooth devices and hardware when running 10.10.2."
