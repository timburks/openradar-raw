    description: "From Apple:\r\nI think you want “$(EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY) not ${CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY}. “Mac Developer” is a placeholder that Xcode swaps out for a real signing identity behind the scenes, it’s not passed directly to codesign.\r\n\r\n====\r\nThe current default setting for the Code Signing Identity of the Debug configuration in Xcode 6.3 is \"Mac Developer\". This has been true for a long time. Unfortunately, it's a poor choice because it's ambiguous on a system which can build for Mac App Store deployment. This is because it matches both \"3rd Party Mac Developer Application: SmileOnMyMac, LLC\" _and_ \"Mac Developer: Greg Scown\". Therefore, it's better to use \"Mac Developer: \", which only matches the latter.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use a system which has both a developer and deployment certificate for the Mac App Store\r\n2. Use a project which has a script build phase which calls codesign, for example:\r\n\r\ncodesign -f -s \"${CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY}\" \"$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/TextExpander.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextExpanderQuickLook.qlgenerator\"\r\n\r\n(It may be that this can be reproduced without #2, but I figured I should report my specific case.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected build to succeed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBuild fails because the Code Signing Identity is ambiguous. Specifically: \"Mac Developer: ambiguous (matches \"3rd Party Mac Developer Application: SmileOnMyMac, LLC (XXXXXXXXXX)\" and \"Mac Developer: Greg Scown (XXXXXXXXXX)\" in /Users/gscown/Library/Keychains/login.keychain)\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\r\n2.6 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB\r\n\r\nXcode Version/Build & OS X Version/Build\r\n6.3/6D570\r\n10.10.3/14D131"
