    description: "Summary:\r\nMost of the time, when listening to podcasts all the way to the end, the play status doesn't sync to other devices. Other devices will not be marked as \"played\" but as \"in progress\" (half blue bubble) and will resume playing at 30 to 90 seconds from the end of the episode.\r\nAs a result, one has to manually mark episodes as read on all one's other devices. This behavior is reproducible on iPhone, iPad & iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample uses iPhone and iPad as devices. Play status syncs over iCloud.\r\n1. Start playing a new episode from a Podcast on iPhone.\r\n2. Let the podcast play out all the way to the end.\r\n3. The podcast is now marked as played, and goes in the \"Played Episodes to be Deleted\" section.\r\n4. Wait for play status to sync automatically.\r\n5. Open the Podcasts app on iPad.\r\n6. Go to the same Podcast as in step 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the played episode in the \"Played Episodes to be Deleted\" section, with no blue bubble. Clicking the episode would play the episode again from the beginning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee the played episode as \"in progress\" (half blue bubble), and not queued for deletion. Clicking the episode will resume playback 30 to 90 seconds from the end.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 [12D508], Podcasts 2.2 (740), iTunes 12.1.0.50\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 32GB, using Wifi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
