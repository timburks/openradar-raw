        Summary:
        A layer-backed source list highlighting outline view will have its contents laid out incorrectly if it is set to use the sidebar system default size style.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add a source list to a window in IB, and ensure some things get shown in it with bindings or whatever.
        2. Set its size style to sidebar system default in IB.
        3. Run and check that everything is displaying correctly.
        4. Quit and layer-back the window’s content view, or the scroll view enclosing the outline view, or some other view in between.


        Expected Results:
        I expected the layout of the cells to be the same whether layer-backed or not.


        Actual Results:
        Layer-backing causes the titles of each item to be shifted upwards substantially, misaligning them relative to the icons.


        Regression:
        This won’t occur if you use automatic size style or if you don’t layer back or both.
