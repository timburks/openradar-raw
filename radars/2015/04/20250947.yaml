    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are two models - MainEntity and SecondEntity, MainEntity objects contain property otherValues which is to-many to SecondEntity. When I run the application on simulator, I see both Objective-C and Swift return objects of SecondEntity when fetching the otherValue. But in tests otherValues contains objects of SecondEntity_SecondEntity_2 so I can't cast result to SecondEntity which leads to failed tests.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project\r\n2. Run the SwiftTestBug target\r\n3. See two lines in a console:\r\n    'The object is really a SecondEntity: SecondEntity'\r\n    'Expected result: other values are objects of type SecondEntity'\r\n    First one is from Objective-C side and the second one is from Swift side. Both mean that type of returned object is correct.\r\n4. Switch target to 'SwiftTestBug Tests'\r\n5. Run tests\r\n6. See test failed with result: 'The object is expected to be a SecondEntity, not just generic NSManagedObject. Actually it is SecondEntity_SecondEntity_2'.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTest should not be failed and CoreData in tests should return the results of type SecondEntity.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTest failed because CoreData returned result of type 'SecondEntity_SecondEntity_2'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3, iOS 8.2, iOS 8.3 beta 3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator"
