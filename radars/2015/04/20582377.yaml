    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you add a new image to the WatchKit App Image Catalog the image set created is Universal. In the scope of the WatchKit App the scope should be Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Create a new project\r\n3. Create a WatchKit App Target\r\n4. Add a image to the Image Catalog inside the WatchKit App\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image set created by the image added should be Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image set created by the image added is Universal.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3 (6C131e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse from Apple:\r\n\r\nThis issue behaves as intended based on the following:\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage people to use Universal images whenever possible, as this allows the catalog to be shared between targets for different device types. For that reason, we default to adding the images to “Universal”.\r\n\r\nPlease update your bug report to let us know if this is still an issue for you."
