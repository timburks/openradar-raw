        Summary:
        A Swift enum case can not have the same name as the associated type it holds. For example:
        public enum item {
        	case Group (Group)
        }

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In a playground define a new enum called testEnum ( enum testEnum { } )
        2. give the enum a case called String and an associated type of String. ( case String (String) )
        3. Notice that you will get an error from the compiler  ‘ Use of undeclared type ‘String’ ‘

        Expected Results:
        I expect to be allow to name a case based on type. In some cases an enum can serve as a type wrapper where you are using cases to determine the type it is holding, and it would be nice to name the cases accordingly.

        Actual Results:
        Error from compiler, name of enum is hiding the type.

        Regression:
        unknown.
