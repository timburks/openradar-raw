    description: "Summary:\r\nSome errors which should be caught at compile time are not reported till cleaning the Workspace. See the following example:\r\n\r\n\tMyObject *objectA = self.array[indexPath.row];\r\n\tMyOtherObject *objectB = objectA.propertyX.propertyY;\r\n\r\nWhile refactoring the code, the property `propertyX` on `object` was removed. Xcode did not reveal an error on Line 2 above and I was able to build and run the application. \r\n\r\nOnly after I cleaned the Workspace and fired a clean build were errors like these revealed although not all. I had to fix-clean-build again several times to reveal these errors."
