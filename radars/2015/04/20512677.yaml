        Summary:
        I’ll create a playlist, and then have it either (a) disappear immediately after I start playing a song, or (b) immediately after I stop listening

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make a selection of 280 songs (give or take) from a smart playlist
        2. Create a new playlist with the ⇧⌘N keyboard shortcut
        3. Give the playlist a name like “RATE NOW”
        4. Click the Shuffle button at the top of the playlist

        Expected Results:
        Between steps 2 and 3, the playlist title at the top of the window should be editable, so I can immediately name the playlist after creating it. After step 4, the playlist should begin playback, and continue until I stop it

        Actual Results:
        Between steps 2 and 3, the playlist title becomes uneditable, requiring me to click it again to change it. After step 4, I hear the first 2 seconds of a song (or less) before the playlist disappears and playback stops. Other times, the playlist doesn’t disappear until after I’ve finished playing a bunch of songs

        Notes:
        I’m not sure if it’s related or not, but last week, over 1000 of my songs suddenly lost their ratings. I have over 21,000 songs in my library, all rated. I didn’t notice this issue with playlists until after that happened.
