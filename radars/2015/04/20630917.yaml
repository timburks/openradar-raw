        Summary:
        When uploading metadata with iTMSTransporter, the upload is reported as successful. But the changes never appear on iTunes Connect. Calling „iTMSTransporter -m status“ reports:

        -------------------------Status Info-------------------------
        Upload created:	2015-04-21 00:59:00
        Upload state:	Import Error


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Download metadata with iTMSTransporter, update the XML and upload again. After the upload was successful, run „iTMSTransporter -m status -apple_id … -u … -p …“ and the status is finally reported as „Import Error“ without any details!

        Expected Results:
        iTMSTransporter -m status reports „Upload State: Successul“.

        A more detailed error message would be helpful. Is there a way to find out what error occured when importing?


        Actual Results:
        „Upload state:	Import Error“ without any details.

        Regression:
        Worked a few versions before like a charm.
