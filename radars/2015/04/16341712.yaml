    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you use the iOS 7 feature of custom transitions, the top layout guide is not honored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create storyboard with navigation controller so you can push and pop between two scenes.\r\n\r\n2. Specify that the scenes should extend their edges underneath top bars.\r\n\r\n3. Add controls to those scenes, which have auto layout constraints that are based upon the top layout guide.\r\n\r\n4. Employ custom animation controller for the push and pop animations in the navigation controller's delegate method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe top layout guide in auto layout should be honored whether using custom transitions or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt behaves as if there is no top bar (and you can see, with iOS 7 translucency) the control behind the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5; iOS 7.1 (11D167); Xcode 5.1 (5B130a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProblem manifests itself in both iOS 7.0 and 7.1."
