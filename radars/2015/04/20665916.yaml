        Summary:
        After connecting my iPhone to power, iTunes locked up

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Explore around iTunes, changing playlists. It’s fully responsive
        2. Unlock my car, where my iPhone’s connected. This gives it power, and causes it to trigger a wi-fi sync with iTunes

        Expected Results:
        iTunes begins the sync operation

        Actual Results:
        iTunes becomes unresponsive, giving me a spinning beachball cursor

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        This has happened sporadically in the past, sometimes triggering a cycle which is difficult to recover from, as it will hang on subsequent startup. I’ve attached a sysdiagnose trace to help with your investigation
