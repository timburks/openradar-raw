    description: "Summary:\r\nAn UnsafeMutablePointer includes functions to initialize or assign to the memory it points to. Several of these functions copy from the source without \"destroying\" it thus not conceptually modifying the source data.\r\n\r\nThe relevant functions are: \r\nfunc assignFrom(source: UnsafeMutablePointer<T>, count: Int)\r\nfunc assignBackwardFrom(source: UnsafeMutablePointer<T>, count: Int)\r\nfunc initializeFrom(source: UnsafeMutablePointer<T>, count: Int)\r\n\r\nIt would be great if UnsafeMutablePointer included overloads of these functions that accepted UnsafePointer<T> as the source argument. Using such overloaded variants would be nicer than having to \"unsafely\" cast an UnsafePointer to an UnsafeMutablePointer for use a source.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3 (6D570)\r\nApple Swift version 1.2 (swiftlang-602.0.49.3 clang-clang-602.0.49)"
