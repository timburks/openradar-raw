        Summary:
        After setting performance baselines for unit tests in Xcode, both locally and for a Bot build, Xcode states “No baseline for ‘Time’ performance metric

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Write a Swift unit test for a Mac app that calls self.measureBlock()
        2. Run the unit test, with a passing result
        3. After it runs, either:
        	a) Click the gray bar reading “Time: 0.xx sec (y% STDEV)”, then click “Set Baseline”
        	or
                b) Navigate to the Performance section for that test run in the Report Navigator, and click “Set Baselines…”
        	or
        	c) Repeat (b) for a test report from an Xcode Bot build

        Expected Results:
        Report Navigator shows a baseline for “My Mac”

        Actual Results:
        Report Navigator shows “No baseline for ‘Time’ performance metric”

        Notes:
        I committed the xcbaselines changes from the Xcode Bot file, and performed a new build, with no difference
