    description: "Summary:\r\nThe system volume is lowered during calls placed over FaceTime Audio, making it difficult to watch videos or listen to music during the call. Similarly, the user can be startled if the call fails as the currently playing media will suddenly become very loud.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a video/song on a Mac or iOS device with FaceTime Audio.\r\n2. Accept or place a call using FaceTime Audio.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe volume of the video/song stays the same and the call is played on top of the video/song, similar to behaviour observed when using Skype or Google Hangouts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe volume of the video/song is significantly capped, making it nearly impossible to listen to at the same time as the call without increasing the volume to near 100%."
