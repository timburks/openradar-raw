        Summary:
        When using the quick-entry view, like the one available when clicking on a data-detected date in an email, the notes field does not grow to fill the space available, which is often very tall.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) create a new calendar entry, clicking the "details" button, if necessary, to access the detailed entry view
        2) scroll down to the "notes" field and enter multiple lines (more than three) of text notes


        Expected Results:
        I'd expect the notes field to fill the available space in order to show all of the notes, or at least as much of the notes as will fit in the available space

        Actual Results:
        The notes field, regardless of content, is only ever two lines tall

        Regression:
        n/a
