        Summary:
        Arrays of arrays of strings are extremely slow to typecheck.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Write a literal with arrays of arrays of strings. Here’s mine:

        let _ = [
        	[ "one" ],
        	[ "two" ],
        	[ "three" ],
        	[ "four" ],
        	[ "five" ],
        	[ "six" ],
        	[ "seven" ],
        	[ "eight" ],
        	[ "nine" ],
        	[ "ten" ],
        	[ "eleven" ],
        	[ "twelve" ],
        	[ "thirteen" ],
        	[ "fourteen" ],
        ]

        2. time its compilation.
        3. Comment out a few of the inner ones.
        4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have a good picture for how many it takes to bog down.


        Expected Results:
        I expected compilation to complete interactively.


        Actual Results:
        With seven elements it’s interactive:
                0.08 real         0.06 user         0.01 sys

        With eleven, it’s almost 2s:
                1.80 real         1.76 user         0.02 sys

        With fourteen, it’s over 20s:
               22.75 real        22.53 user         0.17 sys


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        Using [String] completes interactively.

        For more fun, try [[[String]]] instead. Here’s seven elements:
                0.17 real         0.15 user         0.01 sys

        and eleven:
                5.97 real         5.88 user         0.08 sys

        and you’re in luck, I got bored and wandered away while fourteen finished so I didn’t cancel it:
               84.10 real        83.05 user         0.88 sys

        It seems odd to me that going from [String] to [[String]] appears to be exponential while [[String]] to [[[String]]] appears to be linear (~4x slower). Or maybe [String] to [[String]] is just an extremely large factor? But that’d be weird too.
