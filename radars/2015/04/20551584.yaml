    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://20549403\n\nSummary:\n\nIn UIKit, unlike AppKit on the Mac, thereâ€™s currently no public way to detect the current first responder. Developers therefore need to resort to workarounds like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5029267/is-there-any-way-of-asking-an-ios-view-which-of-its-children-has-first-responder/14135456#14135456. \n\nAppKit already provides -[NSWindow  firstResponder] https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSWindow_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSWindow/firstResponder, and I would like to request that an equivalent method is added to the public iOS API as well. \n\nRegression:\n\nA public first responder  API is still missing as of iOS 8.3."
