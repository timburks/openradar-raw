    description: "Summary:\r\n\"Fix Issue\" with Xcode to support building to a new Apple Watch takes up two device slots in the provisioning portal\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect an already provisioned phone that now has a paired watch.\r\nAttempt to build and run on the phone (not necessarily the watch target).\r\nGet dialog claiming it can fix the issue.\r\nAllow it to Fix Issue.\r\nApp runs on phone as expected.\r\nUnbeknownst until investigating the provisioning portal: the device is duplicated.\r\n\r\nGot to the Certs Idents and Profiles section of developer portal\r\nView Devices > All\r\nSee 2 of the same item same UDID\r\n\r\nThis device was connected to one Mac, one version of Xcode, and never entered manually on developer.apple.com.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee only one UDID\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee the exact same item twice\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshot. (Showing two watches, paired with one phone each, each duplicated with exact same UDID twice). The number of devices (out of 100) reflects the duplication (allowing fewer devices than promised)."
