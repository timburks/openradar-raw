    description: "The Test navigator swaps to the next connected device when its done running tests. This is particularly frustrating if you're testing on multiple devices as you have to swap back to your device of choice which Xcode changes on completion.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open or create a project with some tests\r\n2. Connect 2 (or more) iOS devices to your Mac via USB\r\n3. Select device #1 for the active scheme\r\n4. Run the test suite\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\nThe test suite runs, completes and lets you know if the tests passed or failed.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\nThe test suite runs, completes and lets you know if the tests passed or failed. Xcode then swaps the selected device to device #2. Running the test suite again will do the same thing, and the selected device will swap back to device #1."
