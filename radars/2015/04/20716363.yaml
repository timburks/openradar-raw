    description: "Summary:\r\nChanging Watch language and Siri language to Japanese and then calling \r\n- presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions:allowedInputMode:completion: still shows the Cancel and Done buttons in English. Apple's preinstalled apps, like Messages, correctly translate these buttons, but third-party apps are forced to deal with English worldwide, which is a terrible user experience\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Watch iPhone app\r\n2. Change General > Language & Region > System Language to Japanese\r\n3. In Settings.app, change General > Siri > Language to Japanese\r\n4. Open a third-party app that calls \r\n- presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions:allowedInputMode:completion:\r\n5. Cancel and Done buttons are still in English instead of Japanese\r\n6. Tap Done without saying anything\r\n7. Siri's error text is still in English instead of Japanese\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the system language is not English, all system text should be in the translated language\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome text is still in English in third-party apps, even with the system language set to Japanese\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, Watch OS 1.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB Verizon, Apple Watch Sport 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'cancelDone.png' was successfully uploaded."
