    description: "Summary:\r\nMy app displays a table of data. While the app is updating that data, there's no good way to show that it's busy doing something. If I replace the whole screen with a progress indicator the user can't browse existing data. If I add an indicator above or below the table then it may not be visible depending on where the table is scrolled to. The best place to display a progress indicator is in the status bar, where it is always visible. This progress indicator already exists but I do not see any way for an Apple Watch app to request that it be displayed.\r\n\r\niOS itself has the UIApplication property networkActivityIndicatorVisible that controls whether the system-wide progress indicator appears in the status bar. I think a similar method on WKInterfaceController would be extremely useful in many apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, Apple Watch\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
