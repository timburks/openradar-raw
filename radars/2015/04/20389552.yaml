    description: "Summary:\r\nThere should be a way to create a document-based app that has a single document in a known location within the apps sandbox. There should be a way to prevent the NSWindow from displaying a NSWindowButton.DocumentVersionsButton (NSWindowDocumentVersionsButton)\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to hide the document version button\r\n \r\n1: Turning off autosving from the Document by returning false from `class func autosavesInPlace() -> Bool`. This is not a good option, because we lose the benefits of autosaving.\r\n\r\n2: Subclassing NSWindow and overriding standardWindowButton:forStyleMask: class and instance methods to return nil for NSWindowButton.DocumentVersionsButton. This is not a good option because I have been informed that NSWindow is not guaranteed to access the NSWindowDocumentVersionsButton via these methods.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a document based app\r\n2. Subclass NSWindow and override methods to return nil for NSWindowDocumentVersionsButton\r\n\r\n-- OR --\r\n\r\n2. Return false from autosavesInPlace() in a subclass of NSDocument\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a recommended way to have a 'singleton' document-based application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SingleDocumentExample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
