    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no option to disconnect a connected Bluetooth device.  On OS X, connected devices have a “Disconnect” option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair an iOS device with a Bluetooth device (e.g., a Bluetooth headset)\r\n2. Observe that with both devices on and connected, there is no way to disconnect the Bluetooth device from the iOS device within the iOS UI.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither tapping on a connected device in the list in Settings > Bluetooth should disconnect it, or tapping on the information circled-I icon should have a “Disconnect” option in addition to “Forget This Device”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to disconnect a single Bluetooth device from iOS without unpairing it."
