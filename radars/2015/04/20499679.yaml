    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom customer logs we noticed that our app called -[CBPeripheral discoverServices:] on a connected peripheral a few times over the course of a couple minutes, but the -peripheral:didDiscoverServices: delegate method did not get called any more. Only a reboot of the iOS device \"fixes\" the issue (there did not appear to be a need to reboot the accessory device).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWe have not found a way yet to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter calling -discoverServices: on a CBPeripheral, the -peripheral:didDiscoverServices: should always get called eventually either when successfully completing the discovery or when failing (possibly due to a timeout for the whole process).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe -peripheral:didDiscoverServices: delegate method did not get called at all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone7,2 (N61AP)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'readme.txt' and 'com.getpebble.pebbletime.enterprise 2015-04-10 04-53.log' were successfully uploaded."
