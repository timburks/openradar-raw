    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an application includes English dialect localizations like en-CA, en-GB, en-AU, the localizations for the display name are reflected in the title of the application window, but not in the name as shown in the filename in the Finder, or when hovering over the item in the Dock.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a default Preferred language in Language & Region system preferences of English (Canada), English (U.K.) or English (Australia).\r\n2. Log back out and in.\r\n3. Open the \"Managed Software Center-src.zip\" Xcode project and build and run the application. It currently has the 10.8 SDK set as the target SDK, but it can be changed to use a more modern SDK like 10.10. Alternatively, there is a pre-compiled app in the \"Managed Software Center.app.zip\" file.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe name in the application window and in the Menu bar displays the app title as \"Managed Software Centre\" - with the alternative \"re\" spelling for \"Center.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the name of the file as shown in the Finder, and the name of the app as shown in the Dock, would be \"Managed Software Centre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe name in the app window and the menu bar is as above, but the localized name is not used in either the Finder or when the mouse is hovered over the application when in the dock.\r\n\r\nIn the attached screenshot, the expected title is shown in the Dock text above the non-localized text in the application window.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 / 14D113c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has worked in previous versions of the OS, tested from 10.6 to 10.9.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n10.10.3, iMac 2013, built with Xcode 6.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Managed Software Center-src.zip', 'Managed Software Center.app.zip' and 'msc_langs.png' were successfully uploaded."
