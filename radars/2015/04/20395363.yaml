        Summary:
        Apps with WatchKit extensions cannot be tested through TestFlight.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create an app with a WatchKit extension.
        - Submit to TestFlight.

        Expected Results:
        Application is accepted and can be installed from TestFlight app.

        Actual Results:
        Error in iTunes Connect: TestFlight doesnâ€™t support apps with WatchKit extension.

        Regression:
        TestFlight is a fundamental part of the development of iOS applications. Being able to test our binaries in a production environment before being released to the App Store is crucial to guarantee our products have the maximum quality. This limitation is a huge step backwards for the ecosystem.
