    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing a MPMoviePlayerController, it is possible to change the currently playing movie by changing its `contentURL` property. Changing the URL then playing the movie should work fine. This behavior is broken in the latest iOS 8.4 beta.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project (KVO externalPlaybackActive crash)\r\n2. Tap the \"Play Basic Stream\" button\r\n3. Tap the \"Play Advanced Stream\" button\r\n4. Observer the app crashing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no crash and the app should play the advanced stream.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes with the following exception:\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: 'Cannot remove an observer <MPAVController 0x146503c70> for the key path \"externalPlaybackActive\" from <MPQueuePlayer 0x170106390> because it is not registered as an observer.'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H4086d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nChanging the content URL of a movie player controller worked fine since iOS 2.0. This regression was introduced in iOS 8.4. The sample project works fine on iOS 8.3 and earlier.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 64GB A1474\r\n\r\nNote to Open Radar users:\r\nThe \"KVO externalPlaybackActive crash\" sample project is available at https://github.com/0xced/radars/tree/master/KVO%20externalPlaybackActive%20crash"
