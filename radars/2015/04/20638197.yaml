    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentPickerViewController is dismissed before its delegate documentPicker:didPickDocumentAtURL: is called. This is a breaking change in iOS 8.2 and is inconsistent with the UIImagePickerController.\r\n\r\n- Breaking change breaking existing code\r\n- Breaks the ability to select multiple files in UIDocumentPickerViewController \r\n- Inconsistent with the UIImagePickerController: the UIImagePickerController lets the user of this API dismiss the view controller when needed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIDocumentPickerViewController should not be dismissed when its delegate documentPicker:didPickDocumentAtURL: is called. The developer should be responsible for dismissing it with code such as:\r\n\r\n- (void)documentPicker:(UIDocumentPickerViewController *)controller didPickDocumentAtURL:(NSURL *)url {\r\n    [controller.presentingViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{\r\n        [self didPickLocalURL:url];\r\n    }];\r\n}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the delegate method is called, the controller has been dismissed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a breaking change because old code that would properly dismiss the controller such as above is now calling dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion: on nil => no result.\r\n\r\n- (void)documentPicker:(UIDocumentPickerViewController *)controller didPickDocumentAtURL:(NSURL *)url {\r\n    [controller.presentingViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{\r\n        [self didPickLocalURL:url];\r\n    }];\r\n}"
