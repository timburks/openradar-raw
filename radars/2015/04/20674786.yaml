    description: "Summary:\r\nAt MedHelp, we have several apps that are iOS 7 only.  There are older versions of the app that were compatible with iOS 6, but we have dropped support for iOS 6.  So users who are still on iOS 6 should only be able to download the last version of the app that supported iOS 6.\r\n\r\nBut lately, that is not the case.\r\n\r\nFor example, our app My Diet Diary, version 5.3.3 requires iOS 7.  In the iTunes app on my MacBook, it says it is an iOS 7 application.  However, on an older iPod Touch, running iOS 6, the App Store is allowing the device to download this newer version of the app, and it crashes on launch.\r\n\r\nThis has not always been the case, it seems to be a recent change that is causing this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes on a Mac\r\n2. Search for My Diet Diary\r\n3. You should find our app, and it is version 5.3.3.  It will say that it requires iOS 7.\r\n4. From an iOS 6 device (we had an iPod Touch), search the App Store for My Diet Diary\r\n5. Look at the version number.  It is 5.3.3.\r\n6. If you download this app, it will crash.\r\n\r\nThe serious bug here is that users with iOS 6 can download this version and it crashes and now the app is completely useless to them, which is not the desired outcome.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the App Store to filter the results and only display the latest version of the app which is compatible with the version of iOS on the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe App Store shows the latest version of the app, which is NOT compatible with the version of iOS on the device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes on my Mac is 12.1.2.27\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis used to work.  Perhaps the App Store is broken?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch running iOS 6.1.3"
