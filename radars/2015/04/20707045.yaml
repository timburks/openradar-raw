Press GO, VC2 is presented. Press BACK, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nIf this is run on an iPhone (i.e. VC2 is presented full screen), BACK will dismiss VC2.\r\nIf VC2 is set as the initial View controller, BACK will dismiss VC2. The presence of the nav controller causes the issue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVC2 should be dismissed when pressing back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe unwind segue method is called, but nothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.2, 8.1, 7.1.2, 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe iPhone 6+ in horizontal recreates this bug but in vertical does not (as the modal is shown full screen) as this is clearly something to do with horizontal compactness and whether VC1 is currently visible on screen.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad retina simulator running 8.2, iPad air 2 running 8.1, iPad mini running 7.1.2, iPhone 6+ simulator running 8.2 in horizontal\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
