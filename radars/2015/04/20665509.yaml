    description: |-
        When resizing the split view that holds the inspectors, the Localization section's columns resize in a nonsensical way.

        Expected:
        The popup at most gets the width of the widest entry (in this case "Interface Builder Cocoa XIB"). It could even be argued that it can be safely reduced to less, as clicking it shows a popup menu that shows both strings again, and there are only two choices *ever*. OTOH the actual language names can be quite long and similar, e.g. Portuguese (Brazililan) and Portuguese (Portugal) are hard to make out.

        Actual:
        The name column stays a fixed width, making it hard to tell apart the different countries, while the popup column insanely eats up all the empty space.
