    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a collection view that I want to be an accessibility element with the adjustable trait.  Its accessibilityLabel is intended to give a VoiceOver user some additional context and be suffixed with the accessibilityLabel of the centered cell.  Unfortunately it seems that this setup is impossible because the VoiceOver automatically focuses the first cell in the collection view regardless of how it answers to the UIAccessibilityContainer methods.\r\n\r\nNote that the collection view should be an accessibility element and not a container because of this line:\r\n\r\n\tself.collectionView.isAccessibilityElement = YES;\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached VoiceOver Focus Cells project\r\n2. Turn on VoiceOver on the device\r\n3. Build and run on the device\r\n4. Swipe right to focus the \"Collection view\" row\r\n5. Double tap to select the row\r\n6. Swipe right to move the focus from the back button to the collection view itself\r\n7. Observe that VoiceOver focuses the first cell and speaks \"Custom accessibility label for cell number 0\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver should read \"Collection view accessiblity label\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceOver reads \"Custom accessibility label for cell number 0\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 (12A405)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached sample project also has the same scenario for a table view, which does behave as expected.  \r\n\r\n1. Open the attached VoiceOver Focus Cells project\r\n2. Turn on VoiceOver on the device\r\n3. Build and run on the device\r\n4. Swipe right twice to focus the \"Table view\" row\r\n5. Double tap to select the row\r\n6. Swipe right to move the focus from the back button to the table view itself\r\n7. Observe that VoiceOver focuses the entire table and speaks \"Table view accessibility label\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5c AT&T"
