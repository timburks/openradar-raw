        Summary:
        It would be nice if crash logs contained demangled symbols. There are cases when you want the mangled name, but there are more cases where third-party developers want the demangled one.

        Post-processing crash logs to demangle them is certainly possible, but then you have to manually apply this process to crash logs received from users, pasted into emails, and so forth, and that complicates things since they may be partial (I.e. someone may have just copied/pasted the crashing thread). If they were demangled in the source log then that complication goes away entirely.
