    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are adding a UINavigationController (containing a UINavigationBar) as a child view controller and showing the navigation controller view over part of the presenting controller view (half-modal appearance, see the screenshots in the attached archive). During this we noticed that if the view is positioned at certain (non-point-aligned?) coordinates, the UINavigationBar displays itâ€™s extended size, as it were underneath the status bar in UIBarPositionTopAttached. This also happens if only pixel-aligning the coordinates (which is what we did). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen and run the attached project. Follow the on screen instruction. The relevant code is in ViewController. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UINavigationBar would show the extended appearance only when positioned at the top of the screen (underneath the status bar). \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UINavigationBar would show the extended appearance at certain coordinates. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niOS 8.2, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround seems to be to always position the navigation controller view aligned to logical points (using integer values for the frame).
