    description: "Summary:\r\nif you 'share' an app after drilling in from the Updates tab, the url for the app isn't passed in... you can see this if you try to share by Message - it just transfers the title of the app, no url... but come to the app from any other method/tab and the url is attached\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open AppStore app on iPhone\r\n2. Tap \"Updates\" tab.\r\n3. Tap on an app listed to expand the description.\r\n4. Tap on app again to push into app detail screen\r\n5. Tap on \"share/forward\" icon in top right of navigation bar\r\n6. Choose a method to share the app information\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that the appsto.re URL would be attached/included in the attachments passed to the share/action activity chosen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo URL is attached. I have also confirmed this by writing a custom iOS Action Extension and inspecting the attachments provided. No attachment with \"public.url\" UTI is passed in.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iOS 8.3"
