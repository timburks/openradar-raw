    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are unable to take advantage of the awesome features of IBDesignable in our project because any changes made to these files causes the entire project to get recompiled (incremental compilation is effectively not working). Also IBDesignable slows down Xcode a lot too, and slows down the build in other ways it seems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a class with @IBDesignable.\r\n\r\nMake changes to this class, and build. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly the files that use this class are recompiled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll swift files in the project will get compiled again. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 6.3.1 and OSX 10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
