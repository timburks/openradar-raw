    description: "Summary:\r\nOur team figured out that UIView with autolayout could be cause of crash in UIWebView if they both displayed on the screen at the same time. Attached example project and crash log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached project \"UIWebView\"\r\n2. Run \"UIWebView (Autolayout)\" scheme. Site http://mail.yandex.com will be opened.\r\n3. Fill in form using login \"<deleted>\" and password \"<deleted>\"\r\n4. Tap on the \"hamburger\" menu. Side menu will be shown\r\n5. Quickly switch between different folders, probably few times per second. Its better to switch between folders with mails and folders without mails. It could take some time or several launches but application will be crashed (see atttached crashlog).\r\n6. Run \"UIWebView (Manual layout)\" scheme.\r\n7. Repeat steps 3-5. At this time application will not crashed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApplication work as expected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication crashed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 16Gb using WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIWebView  27.04.15, 14-19.crash' and 'UIWebView.zip' were successfully uploaded."
