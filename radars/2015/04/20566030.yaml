    description: "Summary:\r\nInstead of prompting the user for a Two Factor Authentication code, FaceTime/Messages send the user to https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage/security/secondary-password and request an app-specific password (as demonstrated in the attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Two Factor Authentication on an Apple ID.\r\n2. Log in to FaceTime/Messages on a Mac using the TFA protected Apple ID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user is asked to type a one time password that is sent to their phone, similar to the authentication flow seen at appleid.apple.com or icloud.com.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user must generate an app-specific password and use this as their account password for FaceTime/Messages.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X Yosemite 10.10.3/14D131.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll modern Macintosh computers that support Mac OS X Yosemite.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-04-16 at 01.00.48.png' was successfully uploaded."
