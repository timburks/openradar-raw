    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I have a type (e.g. a struct) with a property (let's call it \"blah\"), and then I declare a protocol that requires a property named \"blah\", and I then declare an empty extension to the struct in a different file that conforms to the protocol, I get linker errors when I try to build.\r\n\r\nI've attached a very small project that demonstrates this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swift project in Xcode\r\n2. Declare a struct with a single property named \"blah\", which conforms to no protocols.\r\n3. Create a protocol which declares a single property named \"blah\", requiring a getter.\r\n4. Create another .swift file\r\n5. In the new .swift file, declare an empty extension to the struct which conforms to the protocol.\r\n6. Try to build.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Either of the two steps below causes the build to succeed:\r\na. Move the extension into the file where the struct was originally defined\r\nb. Remove the property requirement from the protocol\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild succeeds. Alternately, build fails with a intelligible error message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild fails with a message similar to the following:\r\n\r\nUndefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\r\n  \"__TFV11ProtocolBug10SomeEntityg4blahSS\", referenced from:\r\n      __TTWV11ProtocolBug10SomeEntityS_15AnotherProtocolS_FS1_g4blahSS in test1.o\r\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.1 (6D1002) running 6.3.1 command line tools; OS X 10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2013 15\" Retina MBP"
