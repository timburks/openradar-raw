    description: "Summary:\r\nI designed my Apple Watch app using page-based interface, following Apple Watch Programming Guide:\r\n“You can change the set of pages you want to display by calling the reloadRootControllersWithNames:contexts: method early in the launch cycle. For example, you might call that method in the init method of your main interface controller to force WatchKit to load a different set of pages.”\r\n\r\nIt works perfectly on simulator but can not load the pages on Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nSample code: http://cl.ly/0O3G1i3B0Z3j\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample app on watch simulator to see it works.\r\n2. Run sample app on Apple Watch to see it can’t load pages."
