        Summary:
        Setting scrollEnabled mostly disables scrolling. But it will snap back on several unrelated events.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Programmatically set the offset outside of the user scrollable contentSize. For instance, if you want to scroll a subview so that it is flush with the top of the scrollView, lock the user from scrolling, and display some UI covering the rest of the scroll view.

        Expected Results:
        Nothing should change the offset except for an explicit programatic setting of the offset.

        Actual Results:
        Dragging on a view in front of the scroll view, toggling the keyboard, etc. will move the offset (without animation) so that it is confined to the bounds of the contentSize.
