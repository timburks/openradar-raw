    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, Swift runtime can not handle casting from [T?] to [T] and throws fatal error. Please notice it is not an unwrapping nil error(which runtime should catch, correctly) but a type casting error.\r\n\r\nIdeally, runtime should be able to handle this kind of casting. Before that, it is the compilerâ€™s job to catch it during compilation.\r\n\r\nSample code: http://cl.ly/3N3R2I3g0F1e"
