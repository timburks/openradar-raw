    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you try to AirPlay to an Apple TV that is displaying an ad for the new HBO Now service after updating to the latest OS, the AirPlay content will not appear until you dismiss the ad with the remote.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Update an Apple TV to 7.2 (I’m not 100% sure that’s the most recent version. Just replace “7.2” with “the most recent version as of this submission” if not).\r\n2. AirPlay something to the TV using AirPlay Mirroring.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou see your content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou see an ad for HBO Now.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown"
