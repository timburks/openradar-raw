    description: "Summary:\r\nThe LAContext localizedFallbackTitle is being ignored and only the \"Cancel\" button is being presented to the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Run the KeychainTouchID Apple-provided sample application\r\n2) Tap \"Local Authentication\" on the bottom tabbar\r\n3) Tap \"Touch ID authentication (custom)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA second button saying \"Enter PIN\" should appear alongside the \"Cancel\" button\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJust the Cancel button appears\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 / 12F70\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is very serious, as it effectively prevents users from my app which elected to use TouchID to access their data if they somehow can't use their registered finger tips. The fallback button serves exactly to allow them to enter a pin or other password in these situations.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s"
