        Xcode has started randomly building targets in my project today without me doing anything (I'm spending my day individually selecting XIBs in the project and removing them from all targets because Xcode doesn't show the Target Membership section when more than one XIB is selected).

        It doesn't just build the current target, but randomly builds other targets (in this case it built several versions of our application, the debug and the release target, as well as a differently branded version of the app that is a separate target.

        I don't think I did anything to trigger this, as (as you can see from attached screen shot) the "Stop" button is inactive while this build is going on, whereas a regular build would let me abort it.

        In case Sarah Connor reads this, the Singularity happened on Wednesday, April 22nd 2015, 16:32 CEST.
