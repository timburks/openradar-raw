        Summary:
        WatchKit apps seem to be very picky about invalid entries in their plist files.

        To give one example, enter the key LSHasLocalizedDisplayName (which is valid for other extension types) in a watch app plist file.
        When running to the simulator, the only output is an alert with the text “SPErrorGizmoInstallNeverFinishedErrorMessage”.
        This makes it very difficult to debug the issue. If this key is in fact a deal-breaker, the build tools should catch it and output an error with useful debugging information.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create a WatchKit app, and add the key LSHasLocalizedDisplayName to its plist.
        - Attempt to run the watch app target to the simulator.

        Expected Results:
        Either everything just works, or the build tools (validator) catch this invalid key in the plist, and print out an error pointing to the cause of the failed installation.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode prints out the error “SPErrorGizmoInstallNeverFinishedErrorMessage”
