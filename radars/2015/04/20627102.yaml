        Summary:
        If a view or view controller is not part of a window view hierarchy, traitCollection has a blank empty instance (but not nil). In this state, displayScale is set to 0.0. This causes major issues if you try to get the physical pixel size of the device for a hairline size (1.0 / self.traitCollection.displayScale). With any other default, the normal workflow of the code should update when the traitCollection changes. But with 0.0, because of math, you get NaN, which causes a crash when used with Core Animation.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to create a default size for a view based on the displayScale before it is added to a window hierarchy.

        Expected Results:
        The value should default to either 1.0 or the main screens displayScale.

        Actual Results:
        0.0, which causes NaN which causes crashes.
