        Summary:
        When working with the Photos framework, it is needed to get a list of all the assets for a collection list sequentially. For instance, you may have a collection view with sections for each moment, but when the user taps on an asset, take them to a fullscreen paged view of all the assets in all the moments. Currently, in order to navigate between the assets in code, you must use tricky logic to increment not only the asset in a given moment, but then the moments in all the moments. This becomes even more tricky when using predicates that might eliminate all the photos from a given moment (like filtering by mediaType).

        Expected Results:
        Something along the lines of -[PHAsset fetchAssetsInCollectionList:options:].

        Actual Results:
        You must fetch all the asset collections for a collection list and then for each of those, fetch the assets in those collections, potentially skipping empty collections.
