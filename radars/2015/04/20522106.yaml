        Summary:
        Since updating to OS X 10.10.3, Xcode 6.3, and Server.app 4.1, I’ve started regularly getting very high CPU usage from the servermgrd process, making it difficult for anything to run on the machine. Killing the process helps for a little while, until it comes back. I also reinstalled the Server app, which didn’t make a difference. “top -o cpu” shows it at 150-170% on the Core 2 Duo for long stretches. It seems to happen most often while Xcode Server is active. I was on the Xcode 6.3 beta 3 and beta 4 without running the betas of OS X or Server, so Xcode’s not likely to blame.
