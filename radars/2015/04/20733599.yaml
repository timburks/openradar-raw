    description: "Summary:\r\nAs far as I know, the way to get information about Camera Roll using PhotoKit is:\r\nPHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollectionsWithType(.SmartAlbum, subtype: .SmartAlbumUserLibrary, options: fetchOptions)\r\n\r\n(If my assumption is wrong, please tell me the correct way. Thanks!)\r\n\r\nThere are two issues:\r\n1. estimatedAssetCount is NSNotFound.\r\n2. photoLibraryDidChange doesnâ€™t contain change details about Camera Roll.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample app.\r\n2. Read console logs to see estimatedAssetCount is NSNotFound.\r\n3. Add pictures to or delete pictures from Camera Roll using Photos.app.\r\n4. Switch back to sample app.\r\n5. Read console logs to see NOTHING about Camera Roll changes.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1p0g1c2d3c1t"
