        Summary:
        When using an NSLengthFormatter, it’s great that the default value will convert from meters to an automatically-selected unit, but there are cases when another unit would be preferred, and it’d be nice to have NSLengthFormatter take care of that conversion.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an NSLengthFormatter.
        2. Use -stringFromMeters with 402.336 meters, or a ¼ mile.

        Expected Results:
        The output is 0.25 miles.

        Actual Results:
        The output is 439.99 yards.

        Notes:
        Right now, this is possible by doing the conversion yourself:

        double miles = meters * 0.00062137;

        [self.lengthFormatter stringFromValue:miles
                                         unit:NSLengthFormatterUnitMile]; // 0.25 miles

        But since NSLengthFormatter already has logic for converting between units built-in, it would be swell to do something like this:

        self.lengthFormatter.preferredUnit = NSLengthFormatterUnitMile;
