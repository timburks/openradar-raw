        Summary:
        If you unlock the phone using the keypad, the next time you open an application the default iOS keyboard is displayed rather than your custom keyboard.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) enable a custom keyboard
        2) open it in Notes (for instance), and confirm that you see the correct keyboard
        3) lock your phone
        4) unlock using your PIN via the key-pad.
        5) open Notes again and notice that you get switched to the stock keyboard

        Expected Results:
        Your custom keyboard is opened

        Actual Results:
        The Apple Stock keyboard is opened.

        Regression:
        This always occurs when unlocking with the PIN-pad, and does NOT occur when unlocking with TouchID. I have confirmed it with multiple custom keyboards.
