    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you paste a composed Unicode character sequence such as “\U0001F44A\U0001F3FC” (U+1F44A U+1F3FC) into a shell, Terminal renders it as “\U0001F44A\\U+1F3FC” rather than “\U0001F44A\U0001F3FC”. You can select each glyph individually, for example the “\\” or the “+”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy the following composed character sequence: \U0001F44A\U0001F3FC.\r\n2. Paste it into a Terminal shell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither “\U0001F44A\U0001F3FC”, or “\U0001F44A” followed by “\U0001F3FC” (a tan-colored swatch).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n“\U0001F44A\\U+1F3FC”. The buffer contains U+1F44A U+1F3FC as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D131)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n“\\U+1F3FC” is not a valid character escape sequence in Bash or the Swift CLI, which is where I first discovered this behavior.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
