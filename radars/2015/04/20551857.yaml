        Summary:
        When opening the disclosure triangle for a Run Script trigger on a bot, the editor is scrolled over about 1 character to the right, even if the text isnâ€™t as wide as the editor. Hitting Command+Left with the editor focused, or swiping over with a magic mouse/trackpad gets it back into the right place. See the attached photo.
