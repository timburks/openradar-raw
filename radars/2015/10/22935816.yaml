    description: "Summary:\r\nThe -Swift-h file in a mixed project does not update to include an edited version of a Swift initializer (even after a clear of derived data.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a project with Swift and ObjC\r\n2. Create a class in Swift with a initializer\r\n3. Create an instance of the class in ObjC using the initializer\r\n4. Change the parameter list in the Swift file\r\n5. Use the new argument list in ObjC. - Cannot find initializer with new parameter\r\n6. Look in -Swift.h to see what initializers are available. \r\n7. Old initializer is still there.\r\n8. Wipe derived data to force a rebuild of the -Swift.h file\r\n9. Now class has no initializer in the -Swift.h file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to see the new initializer available in in the -Swift.h file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI did not see the new initializer in in the -Swift.h file"
