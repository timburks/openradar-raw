    description: "The documentation for the identifier property on the CBPeripheral class has an availability listed of iOS 7.0 - iOS 7.1 however there is no deprecation statement in the property description text and no alternative provided.  In fact, identifier is listed as the replacement for the deprecated property UUID.\r\n\r\nFurther, Xcode does not issue a deprecation warning when this property is used and it continues to function in both iOS 8 and iOS 9"
