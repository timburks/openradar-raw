    description: "Summary:\r\nOnce in a while I run into an issue with an app I'm working on and it would be helpful to manually examine the app's data. Previously I could use Xcode's Organizer to do this, and that does still work for some apps. But since extensions were added it's now pretty common to need to store data in an App Group. There's no simple way to directly access that data. The best I've come up with is writing my own in-app code to email the files to myself. It'd be a huge help if I could just use the Xcode Organizer to grab the files off my devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an iOS device to a Mac\r\n2. Open Xcode\r\n3. Choose Window > Organizer\r\n4. Select the device on the left\r\n5. Select an app in the Installed Apps list\r\n6. Click on the gear icon and choose \"Download Container\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be ideal if App Group data was either included with this download, or their was a separate option to download App Group data with the Organizer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way to access App Group data outside of your own app's code.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1 beta 3 (7B85)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac with Retina Display, 4GHz i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, M295X\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
