        Summary:
        Previously on 10.10, one was able to copy and paste the standard folder icon onto a volume so it wouldn’t display as a gray little platter but as a folder. When one dragged that to the Finder sidebar, this was kept valid and showed as a folder. Maybe this issue is a sympton of 23247459 (apple radar). Previously, my folders „Downloads, Documents …“ got the correct items in the sidebar, probably due to their name.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a volume called „Documents“, apply a folder icon via Finder->get info->select disk symbol->paste via command-v. Drag that volume in the sidebar in the Finder. Becomes disk icon again.

        Expected Results:
        As in 10.10, it should display icons (if only for the special name ones like Documents, Music and Downloads etc)

        Actual Results:
        Little hard drive icons next to the volumes

        Regression:
        Happened as of 10.11, not present in 10.10
