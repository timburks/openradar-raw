    description: |-
        When creating a production certificate in the member center, the name given in Keychain is replaced by the name of the team. This is not the case for development certificates, or for push certificates, and presumably for other types of certificates.

        Working in a large company with multiple iOS teams, we often end up hitting the maximum 3 certificates. When we go to clean them up, we have no way of knowing who created them, or for what team. We have to play Russian roulette.
