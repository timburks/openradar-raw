    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen beginning a new run in Instruments after a previous relatively long run, the \"Deck\" (the part where the instruments graphs are shown) does not scroll back to the beginning of time.\r\nThis results in the user having to scroll left to reset the view to time 00:00:0000 and see the new graph being drawn.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch instruments, with the memory analysis template for example\r\n2. Start a first run\r\n3. Let the graph be drawn for a few minutes (enough for the start of the graph to be scrolled out of your screen)\r\n4. Stop the current run\r\n5. Begin a new run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Deck is scrolled back to its initial position, showing the new graph being drawn at the beginning of time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scroll position of the Deck does not change. Resulting an empty graph view, until the user scrolls back left to reveal the graph.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0.1 (7A1001)\r\nInstruments 7.0.1 (7A1001)\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A284)"
