        Summary:
        When trying to change a font of an Attributed String in Interface Builder a font selector pops up. That font selector will always hide the Collection column and I can't access it in any way. I suppose that is intended when the window's width is rather small, since I can see the column appear when I'm dragging the side to change its width, but at whatever value I stop at the column hides very quickly. I can't access that column in any way: keyboard (left), scrolling, monkey-resizing or trying to select a Collection while it animates away don't work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Xcode, open a .storyboard file, select an element where you can put an NSAttributedString, select the font picker.

        Expected Results:
        I can select a collection of fonts,

        Actual Results:
        I'm stuck with the current selected Collection.

        Regression:
        I don't remember this happening before, but I don't have any idea when this was introduced.
