It continued when I upgraded that phone to the release version of iOS 9 and when I restored my encrypted iTunes backup of that phone to my new iPhone 6s. It has occurred for every version of iOS 9 I've installed so far.\r\n\r\nA friend has seen the same issue on her iPhone 4S and replacement iPhone 5s, both running iOS 9. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 128GB O2, using cellular 4G\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
