    description: "Summary:\r\nXCUI testing presently requires relaunching the application for every single test in a suite rather than once per suite. This is a giant pain for applications with larger UI hierarchies. \r\n\r\nIf I need to test a screen that is displayed to the user after I’ve registered and added a credit card but before I get into my main application, I have to go through getting to the registration page, filling out the registration form, filling out the credit card form just to get to the screen I need to test for every. single. test. \r\n\r\nThis exponentially increases how long each test takes to run, and makes it impossible to test multiple things which share similar state without just resorting to convenience methods and manual cleanup rather than individual tests. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write XCUI tests \r\n2. Notice that the app has to relaunch for every test\r\n3. Realize that XCUIApplication().launch() is in the instance setUp() and not the class setup\r\n4. Move XCUIApplication().launch() to the static class setUp()\r\n5. Try to run test suite (ie, all the tests in one class). \r\n6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR0iRf_2j7k\r\n7. Have sad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I put XCUIApplication().launch() in the static class setUp(), it should only launch the application once at the beginning of the test suite, allowing navigation to one part of the app for the test suite, and not requiring re-navigating to that portion of the app again for other tests in the same suite. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp must relaunch and re-navigate for every. single. test. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUI testing was just introduced, so it’s not really a regression unless you’re comparing to *gasp* third party tools. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a major dealbreaker for me in actually using XCUI testing because of how badly it inflates the time it takes to run UI tests."
