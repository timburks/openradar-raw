    description: "Summary:\r\nOn phones / operating systems that support News and Apple Pay the region format has been conflated with region. \r\n\r\nSetting the region format to, for example, Dutch means apps use the metric system, the clock is set to 24 hour, dates are formatted using DD-MM-YY, etc. Setting the region format to Dutch also means Apple Pay and News are disabled and inaccessible.\r\n\r\nRegion and format are different concepts. Features should not be enabled/disabled based on the user's preferred format.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. With a phone that is in a region that supports Apple Pay and News (For example has an American Credit Card, American iTunes Account)\r\n2. Go to Settings -> General -> Language & Region -> Region\r\n3. Set Region to a region that does not support News and/or Apple Pay\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple Pay and News to be available based on the American iTunes Account/Credit Card\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple Pay and News are not available"
