        Summary:

        When you create a Swift protocol with similar function signatures, it
        can become impossibly to conform to the protocol according to the
        compiler.

        Steps to reproduce:

        1. Create a protocol with generic functions of the same signature
        2. Make one function with type constraint `T` and another with `T: RawRepresentable`
        3. Attempt to create a struct that conforms to the protocol

        OR:

        1. Run `swiftc GenericProtocolError.swift`

        Expected results:

        Swift should happily compile the example with no problem!

        Actual results:

        The compiler errors with "type does not conform to protocol"

        Notes:

        - See error.log for the error and note output
        - The note makes it sound like the functions are interpreted as the same
          signature regardless of the difference in `T`
        - Removing the protocol and just having the functions on the struct
          works fine.
