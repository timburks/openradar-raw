        Summary:
        This has happened twice now. I'll be typing a message in one thread, then I'll get a notification (both times the notification was for a group text). I'll tap Send in the thread I'm in and then tap the notification to go to the other thread, and my message from the first thread will be sent in the second thread. When I come back to the first thread, my message is still typed out in the text field as if it hasn't been sent.

        This is a horrible bug and means I can't trust Messages as a messaging platform because a text about Person A sent to Person B could accidentally be sent to Person B.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Type out a message
        2. Tap Send as you receive a notification for a message in another thread
        3. Tap the notification
        4. The message meant to be sent in the first thread will be sent in the thread for the notification you tapped

        Expected Results:
        Messages I type in one thread should only ever be sent in that thread. A message should not be able to accidentally cross threads.

        Actual Results:
        Messages can magically be sent in threads I didn't type them for.
