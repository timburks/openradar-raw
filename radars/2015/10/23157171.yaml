    description: "Summary:\nBasic UITableViewCell resets Dynamic Type font set in Interface Builder after Dynamic Type settings change.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create dynamic table view controller with basic (not custom) table view cell in interface builder.\n2. Assign subhead style font for title label in cell.\n3. Run the app.\n4. Change Dynamic Type settings in iPhone (Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Large Text)\n5. Go back to app and try adding more new items in data source. You will see cells using different fonts.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe same font style as specified in Interface Builder should be used to display title in basic cells even after Dynamic Type settings change.\n\nActual Results:\nThe font selected in Interface Builder is being replaced with body style font.\n\nRegression:\n\nNotes:\nIt looks like table view cell removes text labels from hierarchy before UIContentSizeCategoryDidChangeNotification notification. Text labels are re-created then but missing fonts information. \n\nStatic table views designed in Interface Builder suffer much more from that and get completely broken because the information displayed in table view cells is now gone forever."
