        Summary:
        Every time we upload a new build of an app, the app is in the Processing state for often more than an hour. It should be much faster.

        As thereâ€™s no notification on when a build is ready to be used for submission to the App Store or for TestFlight testing, one has to go check the status manually every couple of minutes. When you have multiple apps on different iTunes Connect accounts, this is a lot of work which has to happen manually.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * upload a new build of an app to iTunes Connect from Xcode

        Expected Results:
        * App usable for testing or submission instantly or at most a couple of minutes

        Actual Results:
        * App is Processing for more than an hour. Sometimes even longer

        Regression:
