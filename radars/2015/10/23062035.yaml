    description: "Summary: When attempting to delete a game just played, the phone can get stuck in wiggle mode and no longer react to touches, home or sleep/wake button.\r\nOnly a hard reboot can resolve this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Install a view games on an iPhone 6s 128 GB.\r\nTiny wings, smashy road, crossy road....\r\n\r\n1.\r\nPlay tiny wings for 30 seconds\r\n\r\n2.\r\nPress home button and tap on smashy road for example and play for 1-3 minutes.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nNext steps need to be performed quick\r\n\r\n4.\r\n4.1 Press home button\r\n4.2 tap and hold the last played game to bring up wiggle mode\r\n4.3 immediately tap on the X to delete the game\r\n\r\nNow the phone should be stuck in wiggle mode.\r\nThe icons are still animating but the phone reacts to nothing anymore.\r\n\r\nIf you had no luck reproducing this please try it 2-3 time. I can reliably reproduce this with 2 attempts and it has hit me in real live usage approximately 5-6 times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I would expect the delete confirmation and that the phone still reacts to input.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The delete confirmation does not come up, the phone remains in wiggle mode and does not react to the home or sleep button, a hard reboot is required.\r\n\r\nVersion: 9.0.2 13a452\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 128 GB"
