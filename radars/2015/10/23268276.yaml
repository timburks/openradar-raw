    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a type conforms to `CustomPlaygroundQuickLookable` and returns a `PlaygroundQuickLook.URL(String)`, the quick look is broken.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a new Xcode Playground\r\n2. Add a new type (or conform an existing one to `CustomPlaygroundQuickLookable`), with the implementation of `customPlaygroundQuickLook()` returning `.URL(String)` with any valid website.\r\n3. Initialize a variable of that type\r\n4. Press quick look button, notice that it only shows the paper icon (see http://i.imgur.com/NFs2i6n.png)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe quick look should actually be the website the URL points too.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe quick look shows the paper icon (see http://i.imgur.com/NFs2i6n.png)"
