    description: "Summary:\r\nI prefer to use iOS in English, but I live in the Netherlands. Being Dutch, I have configured Siri to use Dutch, which works fine. However, Maps is still using English for spoken directions, which is very hard to use with Dutch street names.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change OS language to English.\r\n2. Change Siri language to Dutch.\r\n3. Start route with spoken directions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the Siri language choice to influence the language used for spoken directions, especially when Maps knows that I’m currently in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nI can appreciate the difficulty of choosing a language when the Siri language choice does not match the country the user is currently in, but  I think the chances of getting it right are higher when following the Siri language setting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDutch street names are pronounced as if they were English, leading to unusable results."
