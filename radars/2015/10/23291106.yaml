    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create an outgoing email with an attachment, Mail takes some time to actually attach the attachment.  So if you try to create it via AppleScript and then immediately send it, the message is sent before the attachment is attached.\r\n\r\ntell application \"Mail\"\r\n\t\r\n\tset theSubject to \"Subject\" -- the subject\r\n\tset theContent to \"Content\" -- the content\r\n\tset theAddress to \"whoever@apple.com\" -- the receiver \r\n\tset theSignatureName to \"Standard\" -- the signature name\r\n\tset theAttachmentFile to \"Zany:Users:username:file\" -- the attachment path\r\n\tset msg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theSubject, content:theContent, visible:true}\r\n\t\r\n\ttell msg to make new to recipient at end of every to recipient with properties {address:theAddress}\r\n\ttell msg to make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachmentFile as alias}\r\n\t\r\n\tset message signature of msg to signature theSignatureName\r\n\t\r\n\t--\tsend msg\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the AppleScript, note how the attachment shows up after a few seconds.  Close and delete the message, then uncomment the send msg line and run it again - the message is sent without the attachment.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe message should be sent with the attachment as requested.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message is sent without the attachment.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.1 (3096.5) OS X 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
