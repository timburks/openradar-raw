        Summary:
        There is only one way to zoom in the preview assistant editor view - and only if you have a trackpad.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use any non-trackpad, or non-Apple mouse. Or be disabled and a keyboard user.
        2. Open Xcode to a .storyboard, and open assistant editor to Preview.
        3. Open several different devices to see multiple previews at once.
        4. Attempt to find a zoom command in keyboard shortcuts, help, menus, or by right-clicking in Preview area.
        5. Fail. Give up. Reconsider choice of professions.

        Expected Results:
        I should be able to right-click and get a zoom menu, or find a command somewhere in the menus to change assistant editorâ€™s zoom (like I can find for main editor).

        Actual Results:
        The *only* way to zoom is to find a trackpad and pinch. This can strongly hinder usability or even make preview more or less useless for many developers - especially with multiple previews, which is an essential usage of the feature.

        Regression:
        NA

        Notes:
