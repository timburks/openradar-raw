    description: "Summary:\r\nwhen a site uses push-state to manage url updates AND integrates iOS' Universal Links, the \"open\" banner displayed in safari (see attached screengrab - what's the official name for this?) falls out of sync and can never be updated to use the correct url.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. using a site and app which implement iOS' Universal Links, visit a page using mobile safari\r\n\r\n2. once webpage loads, you should see the \"open\" banner at the top (scroll down to reveal if necessary).\r\n\r\n3. tap the \"open\" link in the banner. you should be taken to the corresponding view within your iOS app\r\n\r\n4. return to safari and navigate to another page, ensuring site updates url via push-state (ex: from example.com/ to example.com/foo)\r\n\r\n5. tap the \"open\" link in the banner again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1st tap to open takes you to one view within the associated iOS app, 2nd tap to open take you to another view.\r\n\r\nmore specifically, after navigating to a new webpage using push-state, the \"open\" link within the banner is updated so that when tapped you are taken to the app view which corresponds with the new url.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ntapping \"open\" within the Universal Links banner always takes you to the view which corresponds to the first url you visit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0"
