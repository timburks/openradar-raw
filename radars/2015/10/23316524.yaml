    description: "using the following configuration within the apple-app-site-association:\r\n\r\n\"paths\": [ \r\n    \"/\",\r\n    \"/explore\",\r\n    \"/explore/*\",\r\n    \"/stories/top\",\r\n    \"/mostviewed\",\r\n    \"/most-viewed\",\r\n    \"/stories/*\",\r\n    \"/s/*\",\r\n    \"/search\",\r\n    \"/search/*\",\r\n    \"/search/hashtags/*\" \r\n]\r\n\r\nlinks to /users/auth/twitter/callback are deep-linked\r\n\r\nnote that in this specific case, the urls impacted are those used by our OAuth flow - so currently our users are not able to sign-in or register using social services (twitter, etc) when visiting our site on safari on iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. install the steller app http://stlr.co/getsteller (lol - not trolling for users here)\r\n2. visit https://steller.co\r\n3. click the \"sign-in\" link in the nav bar located top-left of the page\r\n4. sign-in using whatever social network you want\r\n\r\nNOTE: you do not need an account w/ steller to repro the issue. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOAuth redirect flow completes - you are able to to sign-in to your social identify provider (e.g. twitter, etc) and upon returning to steller.co, you are either signed in or prompted to register a new account.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOAuth redirect is broken after signing into your social identify provider - steller app is launched, link is recognized as unsupported, you are redirected back to steller.co but now see an error page (\"Steller will be back shortly...\"\r\n\r\nNOTE: we maintain a blacklist internally within the app - if we see an incoming Universal Link from a blacklisted url, we redirect back out to safari."
