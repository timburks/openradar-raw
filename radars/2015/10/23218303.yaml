    description: "Description:\r\nThis problem has been ongoing for a couple of weeks now, ever since I created a Cocoa Touch Framework with both Swift and Objective-C code and incorporated that framework into my project. I have a work-around for this problem, so while this has been a hassle, until recently I’ve been able to make progress. However, I just tried to generate a .ipa to upload the app and learned that my work-around isn’t successful for production builds.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Do a clean of all Derived Data\r\n2) Do a build of the project\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe project is free of syntax and other errors and should build and run normally.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nI get a cyclic dependency error causing build to fail.\r\n\r\nXcode Version/Build & OS X Version/Build\r\nI have been primarily using Xcode 7.0.1, but have now seen this error in Xcode 7.1 (non-beta) just released.\r\nOS X 10.10.5\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes\r\nNote that for debug builds I have a work around to this issue. See “Second fix: A workaround” in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32919285/ios-framework-with-swift-and-objective-c-where-the-objective-c-uses-swift-c\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, if I do a production build (e.g., Product -> Archive), I have been unable to build without this error and thus am currently unable to submit this app to Apple."
