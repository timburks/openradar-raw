    description: "Summary:\r\nSome options (especially the Axis one) on UISTackView don't react to Size Class options, especially when rotating the screen (in the code, it does get the correct settings, but it doesn't reflect on screen).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create few stack views with even simple elements inside (one label and one textfield for example).\r\n2) Set their axis to vertical, and add a Size Class (Any, C.h) and set the Axis to Horizontal\r\n3) Look at the preview pane, everything looks correct for Landscape and Portrait settings\r\n4) Build and run (both simulator or device)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the stack views should be horizontal on compact heigh (landscape) and vertical otherwise\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOdd stack views behave correctly while even stack views dont\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1, iOS9 simulators and device\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf checked in code, the parameters appear correct, it's just the rendering on screen that seems broken.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac Retina on OSX 10.11.1, iPhone 5s on iOS 9.0.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StackViewBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Open Radar:\r\nAttached project is a simple one vertical UIStackView that contains 5x UIStackViews, all set to vertical + a SizeClass (Any W,C. H) to horizontal, fill equally, and each containing a label and textfiled."
