    description: "Currently there is no public API which would allow to replicate the user notification style that iTunes uses, which has the possibility to show the actionButton even if the notification style is set to banner.\r\nThe button shows when hovering over the notification.\r\n\r\nRight now this is only possible using the private _showsButtons property."
