        Summary:
        The latest build of my iOS app specified ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=NO in the info.plist file, but when I submitted it for external testing, I still had to specify that I wasnâ€™t using encryption.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Submit build of iOS app using ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=NO to iTunes Connect
        2. Add that build for external testing
        3. Fill out testing notes

        Expected Results:
        App goes to pending beta review

        Actual Results:
        I get the export compliance page
