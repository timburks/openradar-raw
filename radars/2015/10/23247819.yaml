    description: "Summary:\r\nFor train tickets and flight tickets, one might want to keep them (I mean, we keep photos, so why not keep tickets). This is difficult right now as there is no way to archive them to hide them out of the main view where one might have credit cards and loyalty cards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to archive a card.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option to archive cards and view an archived stack of cards/tickets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo archive option found.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
