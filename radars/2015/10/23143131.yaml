        Summary:
        UIImagePickerController is only correctly set up if initialised using -init.  Calling any of the other init methods it inherits return malformed half-configured instances with no functionality.  This behaviour is doesn’t seem to be documented anywhere.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create and present an UIImagePickerController using -[UIImagePickerController initWithNavigationBarClass:toolbarClass:].  The image picker controller and its UINavigationBar is presented but with no root view controller.

        Notes:
        There are a few things that I might expect to see when calling an unimplemented init method, but returning a useless instance feels wrong. In the past I’ve seen
        • An exception
        • An __attribute__((unavailable(“”)))
        • A note in the documentation (I can’t find anything about only calling -init at https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/index.html)
