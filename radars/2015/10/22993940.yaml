        Summary:
        Surprise: something else is broken!
        In this episode of “What’s broken in Appleland?” we’ll cover the mysterious case of building AppleTV frameworks.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create a project (I recommend googling for StackOverflow posts that explain how to do this)
        - Add an AppleTV framework target.
        - Compile target in Release mode from the command line (using Carthage, for example).

        Expected Results:
        - Build succeeds, although this .framework is completely useless (see rdar://22967941 for more details)

        Actual Results:
        - SURPRISE!! It doesn’t. Xcode spits out tons of errors like:
          - /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/include/sys/cdefs.h:707:2: error: Unsupported architecture
        #error Unsupported architecture
          - /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/include/_types.h:42:9: error: unknown type name '__uint32_t'
        typedef __uint32_t      __darwin_wctype_t;
          - ld: warning: Auto-Linking supplied '/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/lib/libobjc.dylib', file was built for x86_64 which is not the architecture being linked (arm64): /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/lib/libobjc.dylib

        Regression:
        This worked in beta 2… (though everything that was previously broken is still broken!)

        Notes:
        I have no idea if this is a known issue because at the time of this writing the release notes have not been published yet.
