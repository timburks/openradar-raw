    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a .mp4 movie. I have a simple SceneKit scene with a sphere. I create an AVPlayer & AVPlayerLayer and assign the layer to the sphere's material, which should show the movie on the sphere's surface. Works great in simulator, blackness on device.\r\n\r\n(sample app supplied)"
