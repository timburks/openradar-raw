    description: "Summary:\r\niOS still lacks a convenient way to remove wifi entries which once were an active/default connection. The only way to get rid of old wifi-connections (which are by the way part of iOS networking-subsystem to be searched for continuously in the background) is to kill/aka reset the whole network settings.\r\n\r\nThis is dangerous for many reasons:\r\n\r\n1. scanning for unneeded once connected wifis, is a way a hacker may find his way into the devices connections by simulating exactly that network\r\n\r\n2. the device continuously broadcasts ALL names of all SSIDs it ever connected to. that is blatantly obscuring users privacy.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FIX IT?\r\nremoving wifi-netwok configs (SSID + password, etc.) is *not* the perfect solution. \r\n\r\nexcluding the UNUSED networks from beeing actively searched for would be perfect. so just let us manage the LIST OF KNOWN NETWORKS and let the user decide to ONLY search for the ONE wifi he was lately connected to actively, OR to search for ALL NETWORKS known.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to remove a known wifi connection that is not active and not in reach to connect to anymore.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can just look that wifi up in my list of wifi's I once connected to. I could just remove the wifi i want from that list. And I could opt to DISALLOW iOS to search for this wiifi any longer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNone of that is possible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2 (13A452)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iDevice will qualify, even tvOS devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
