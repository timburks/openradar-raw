    description: "Summary:\r\nSome Apple Music playlists added to “My Music“ will, when selecting “Make available offline” not actually do so, and not download any songs to device, resulting in them being unplayable when online showing offline music and/or not connected to the internet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music App\r\n2. Select “Make available offline” on a Playlist anywhere via the “three points” menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlaylist gets an icon marking it as available offline and downloads are downloaded to device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, the icon will appear for a split-second, while the loading indicator in the status bar spins.\r\nAfterwards, the icon - if it appeared - will immediately disappear, no songs will be downloaded to device and the playlist cannot be played while offline.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4.1 (12H321)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSometimes this issue can be remedied by switching iCloud Music library/Apple Music off and on again. I also already reset the iPhone to factory settings once and restored from backup.\r\nMany playlists work as expected, but some just refuse to do so. On iPad and in iTunes (on my iMac), the same playlists downloads to device perfectly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 64GB unlocked, tried via WiFi and LTE, showing 22.4GB of available space\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThe issue is back in iOS 9.0.1, and 9.0.2 (13A452), on a brand new iPhone 6s set up as new, not from backup.\r\nAs evidenced by this video I made: https://vimeo.com/141021602\r\nNow as a paying customer, this is not really funny.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nAt least I do not seem to be the only one with this issue.\r\nAnd unless one is personally affected by it, the hoops through which people jump to solve it could almost make you laugh.\r\nExample: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7219542\r\n(Tried that all, if it worked at all then never for long)\r\nExtreme example: https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/3k4zpc/solved_undownloadable_and_unresponsive_apple/\r\n(oh no I won’t…okay, perhaps I will…)\r\n\r\nNew Configuration:\r\niPhone 6s 128GB unlocked, tried via WiFi and LTE, showing 80GB of available space"
