    description: "When I got to upload a build to iTunes Connect, I select my personal account (Daniel Tull) and then proceed to get a message saying:\n\n\n\nNo accounts with iTunes Connect access.\niTunes Connect access for “Daniel Tull” is required. Add an account in the Accounts preference pane.\n\n\n\nI already am logged into this account. \n\nIf I delete the account and add it again, the uploads then work. I do not re-build, I just select the archive in the organizer and click “Upload to App Store…”\n\nOn quitting and relaunching Xcode builds then fail to upload and I need to go through the delete/add account dance. Really quite annoying!"
