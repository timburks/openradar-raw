    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Disk Utility.app should have full support for Core Storage capabilities. For example, Disk Utility.app should have the capability to create cs volumes that span multiple disks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDisk Utility in 10.11 does not fully support Core Storage capabilities. For example, it is not possible to create a volume that spans multiple drives using Disk Utility.app. It is possible from the command line with `diskutil` thankfully, but an advanced UI interface would be useful.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
