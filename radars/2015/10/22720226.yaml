    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you define a simple protocol like:\r\n\r\nprotocol Foo {\r\n    func testPrint()\r\n}\r\n\r\nAnd than you provide a default implementation for testPrint() method in protocol extensions like:\r\n\r\nextension Foo {\r\n    func testPrint() {\r\n        print(\"Protocol extension call\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nYou aren't allowed to call the fault implementation from the structure eg.\r\n\r\nstruct Bar: Foo {\r\n    func testPrint() {\r\n        self.testPrint()\r\n        print(\"Call from struct\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis is some sort of limitation as often happens that a default implementation is providing a major part of implementation and only one, simple line is changed in actual struct implementation. If you're using classes you can achieve this by creating a base class and calling a method on super. If you consider structs, there's no such possibility and you always have to write a whole implementation from scratch in each structure which conforms to the protocol.\r\n\r\n---\r\nYou can use composition by creating nested structure, but it's neither logical or clean... It's rather a hack...\r\n\r\nstruct Bar: Foo {\r\n    func testPrint() {\r\n        // Calling default implementation\r\n        struct Dummy : Foo {}\r\n        let dummy = Dummy()\r\n        dummy.testPrint()\r\n        print(\"Call from struct\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAbility to call default implementation of protocol methods from conforming type.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWon't compile...?\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 GM + Swift 2.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/32602712/calling-protocol-default-implementation-from-regular-method\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/jckarter/status/644154804218953731"
