        Summary:
        While ‘tintColor’ is inherited from the presenting app when showing an SFSafariViewController, there is no way to set the `barTintColor` of either the top address bar or the bottom toolbar. This means that apps with a customised color scheme (for example, Facebook with its blue bar) will show an inconsistently themed view controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create an SFSafariViewController instance.

        Expected Results:
        An exposed property for changing the barTintColor of both bars.

        Actual Results:
        Bars are always white.
