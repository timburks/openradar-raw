    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation states: \"Note that only the path component of the URL is used for comparison; other components such as the query string or fragment identifier are ignored.\" when pattern matching for Universal Links.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for our application because we are trying to match against product URLs across several international stores, and each store uses a different URL format (primarily a localised URL for SEO purposes). The only common denominator across all international store product is a parameter in the query of the URL.\r\n\r\nBecause of the limitation to paths in the pattern matching for universal links we cannot reliably match all product URLs across our international stores.\r\n\r\nWe cannot change the URL format for many reasons - many systems already in place depend on the current setup.\r\n\r\nWe would request that in future, pattern matching for Universal Links includes the query portion of a URL.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up a scenario for universal links in an iOS app, and use a a path that relies on matching a query parameter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUniversal Links should be recognised for the pattern set out in the apple-app-site-association json file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe universal links are not recognised for the patterns in the json file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nuniversal links scenario\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
