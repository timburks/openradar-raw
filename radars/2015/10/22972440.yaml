    description: "Summary:\r\nSFSafariViewController is empty if presentation is delayed after creation by some time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Tap Open Web to see empty SFSafariViewController. Console log shows there are not subviews in SFSafariViewController.view.\r\n3. Uncomment prepareWeb() below FIXME in ViewController.swift. Repeat 1~2 to see the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSFSafariViewController should work normally if it is created first and then presented later. Some code logic ends up like this.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0O2W2C0l2l1F"
