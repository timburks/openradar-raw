    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using lightweight generics in Objective-C, refactoring the name of a class that is used as a type for collections does not update the class name in the collection declarations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new class that inherits from NSObject, e.g. PFCustomObject\r\n2. Define a property as a collection of that class, e.g. NSMutableArray <PFCustomObject *> *list;\r\n3. Rename the name of the custom class via Edit > Refactor > Rename to something else, e.g. PFObject\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe class and filename are renamed as well as collections that reference it, e.g. “NSMutableArray <PFCustomObject *> *list” would become “NSMutableArray <PFObject *> *list”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe class and filename are renamed but collections that reference it are not updated. So “NSMutableArray <PFCustomObject *> *list” is not modified."
