        Summary:
        Selecting an item in the sidebar of the documentation viewer sometimes doesn’t highlight the row I’ve selected. The text color does change, however.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the documentation viewer.
        2. Select an item in the left sidebar (you may need to open it).

        Expected Results:
        The blue background appears behind the item and the text changes color.

        Actual Results:
        Only the text changes color.

        Regression:
        Unknown.

        Notes:
        See attached screenshot. Curiously, if I take a screenshot of the window itself using ⇧⌘4 and the Spacebar, that screenshot *does* have the background color change. If I take a screenshot of the entire window using ⇧⌘3, then the background does *not* appear.
