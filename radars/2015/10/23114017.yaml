    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a framework project that includes some custom subclasses of UIView.  These subclasses include @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable, but when the framework is built and added to another project, it seems that the @IB tags are not being honored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a CocoaTouch Framework Project.\r\n2. Add a subclass of UIView that is @IBDesignable and has some @IBInspectable properties.\r\n3. Make sure the subclass and properties are public\r\n4. Build the framework\r\n5. Add the framework to a new project\r\n6. Add the UIView subclass to a view in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nNotice the @IBInspectable properties are not accessible \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to use the @IBInspectable properties\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan't use the @IBInspectable properties\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0.1\r\nEl Capitan\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLinks to other people having this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/335\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/29933691/ibdesignable-from-external-framework\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI am using Xcode 7.0.1 on El Capitan\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
