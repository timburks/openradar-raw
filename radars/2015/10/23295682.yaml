        Summary:
        Doing a break inside a nested scope that's not a loop,

        e.g.
        do {
          guard true else { break }
          print("true")
        }

        gives this compiler error message:

        error: 'break' is only allowed inside a loop, if, do, or switch

        which makes you think that you can't do what you're doing at all, while you just have to annotate the scope with a label and break that instead,

        e.g.
        doLabel: do {
          guard true else { break doLabel }
          print("true")
        }

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Just use unlabelled break inside a non-loop scope

        Expected Results:
        I expected it to compile, or tell me that for breaking there I needed to use a scope label in the compile error

        Actual Results:
        It doesn't compile and the error is confusing

        Regression:
        None I think
