    description: "Summary:\r\nStarted getting this crash on iOS9 (and 9.1) from the day it was released.\r\nSeems to happen when pushing a ViewController that has a UIWebView onto the view stack and then making a request on it.\r\nIt only seems to happen on select web pages, and we were able to modify our web page to mitigate somewhat the crash (removed some tracking scripts).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun test app.\r\n\r\nWhat the test app does -\r\nRepeatedly:\r\nInstantiates a new view controller with a UIWebView\r\nPushes it onto the view stack\r\nLoads a request in the UIWebView\r\nPops the view controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView slides in\r\nWeb page loads\r\nView slides out\r\nRepeat.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter some 100s or 1000 requests the app crashes after the view slides in before the page loads.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, 9.0, and 9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are crash logs from a live install, assembly dump from xcode, and minimal test app.\r\nOther posts relevant here:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/19354\r\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149495\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 and 6+ mostly\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'crash.log.txt', 'assembly.txt' and 'WebKitTest.zip' were successfully uploaded."
