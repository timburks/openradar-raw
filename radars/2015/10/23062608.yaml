        Summary:
        Users benefit a lot from the new SFSafariViewController, but currently it is limited for a modal presentation only. Especially on iPhone the only way to dismiss this modal view gives a poor UX.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open any APP with a UINavigationController concept in which at some point a SFSafariViewController will be opened. Then there is no over-the-left-edge swipe-back feature nor a top-left-back-button, only a top-right close button.

        Expected Results:
        Users expect a "normal" swipe behaviour.

        Actual Results:
        SFSafariViewController always displays modally.

        Notes:
        Embedding the SFSafariViewController into the UINavigationController's push mechanism would be a perfect solution. In this case, the Done-Button should be replaced by a normal back-chevron on the left-hand side. Additional support for UIContentContainers would even give more flexibility.

        Thank you
