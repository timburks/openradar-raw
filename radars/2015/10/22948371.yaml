    description: "Our app with 62 dynamic frameworks (73 binaries when including libSwift* and the app itself) suddenly takes 3-4 seconds to load on iOS 8 and 9.\r\n\r\nHere our observations:\r\n- Whenever we hit \"pause\" in the debugger during app start, we end up in ImageLoaderMachO::loadCodeSignature -> fcntl\r\n- Device log is spammed with entries like this: amfid[â€¦] <Error>: SecTrustEvaluate [leaf IssuerCommonName SubjectCommonName] -> 73 times - surprise!\r\n- Subsequent app starts are a lot faster. Obviously something is cached. The device log also no longer shows the entries above on app start.\r\n- Few app starts later the cache seems to be purged. The app starts slow again, spams a lot in the device log and hangs in ImageLoaderMachO::loadCodeSignature most of the time."
