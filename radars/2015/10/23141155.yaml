    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm developing a library that comes with a small command-line application for invoking it. Because the Xcode built-in console has issues with libedit and does not properly echo user input, I've configured my Xcode scheme to run my command-line application within Terminal.app. This worked fine until I upgraded to 10.11. Now I have to choose between a broken workflow and turning off SIP completely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple command-line application using Xcode\r\n\r\n2. Using the instructions in the following link, configure the scheme by changing the executable to 'Terminal.app' and adding the command line arguments: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7780301/how-to-run-command-line-application-from-the-terminal\r\n\r\n3. Attempt to build/run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTerminal.app opens running the command-line application, as it did in previous versions of OS X. Alternatively, an error message comes up with some provision to configure the system to allow this behavior without completely disabling SIP.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application does not launch. The Xcode console prints out the following message: \"Message from debugger: cannot attach to process due to System Integrity Protection\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1b3 (7B75), OS X 10.11 (15A284)"
