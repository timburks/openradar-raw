    description: "Summary:\r\nThere seems to be a disconnect across various Now Playing screens for Apple Music on what buttons are present in the now playing screen. In the case of CarPlay, it would be nice to have the \"add track to library\" button currently present on the Apple Watch in the CarPlay Now Playing view. People in the car tend to be listening to radio (like Beats 1, or other stations on Apple Music) and this would be better than interrupting the music to tell siri to add the track with no knowledge if that was possible or not. A button makes this clear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Open Apple Music\r\n3. Start Beats 1 Radio\r\n4. Observe Now Playing Screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn \"Add Track to Library\" button available (see attached)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo button to add library. Must use Siri\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 and above\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attachments for CURRENT watchOS now playing screen and my mock up of what an \"Add to Library\" UIButton would look like.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus, Verizon, 16 GB, CarPlay R11"
