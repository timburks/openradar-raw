    description: "When using NSURLSession to access localhost by using its IP address (i.e. \"http://192.168.1.3/\") the task fails with NSPOSIXErrorDomain, Code=2 \"No such file or directory\".\r\n\r\nFor the error to happen, the following must be true:\r\n- The host on the URL must be the current machines IP address. Using \"localhost\" or \"127.0.0.1\" works as expected.\r\n- The host must actually serve the URL at the given port.\r\n- ATS has to be off for the app.\r\n\r\nThis error is introduced in the SDK iOS 9.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start some http server on the development machine.\r\n2. Open the attached example project.\r\n3. Fill in the correct IP address (from ifconfig or the network system configuration)\r\n4. Run the demo app in the simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=2 \"No such file or directory\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS SDK 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.0.1, Mac OS 10.11"
