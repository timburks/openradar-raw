        Summary:

        The Apple Color Emoji font contains ’sbix’ bitmap resources for strikes at 20, 32, 40, 48, 64, 96, and 160 pixels (ppem). On a Retina display, many of these resources are never displayed.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Install the attached TestColorEmoji.ttf font. This font is derived from the Apple Color Emoji font (version 11.0d7e1) and has had the PNG resources in the ‘sbix’ strikes replaced with versions that make the resolution changes more obvious. The background color changes according to the size of the resource:

        	black = 20 × 20 pixels
        	green = 32 × 32 pixels
        	red = 40 × 40 pixels
        	dark blue = 48 × 48 pixels
        	cyan = 64 × 64 pixels
        	magenta = 96 × 96 pixels
        	light blue = 160 × 160 pixels

        2) Open the attached Emoji Scaling.rtf file and display it on a Retina and non-Retina screen.

        Expected Results:

        The bitmap resource in the font should be selected according to display resolution.

        Actual Results:

        The results on a non-Retina display look correct: ’sbix’ strike for the ppem value ranges from 20 to 160:

        On a Retina display, only the strike for 96 and 160 ppem is shown:

        At 11 points, a 20 pixels should be used on a non-Retina display and a 40 pixels should be used on Retina. At 14 points, 32 and 64 pixels should be used, and so on.

        Regression:

        N/A

        Notes:

        I have not tested this on iOS, but since CoreText is used for text layout on both platforms, I suspect there will be problems there as well.
