        Summary:
        Please add API for SFSafariViewController to move the Done button to the left side of the navigation bar. I recommend this because many other apps have located their done button for web view modals on the _left side_ of their navigation bar, and it feels strange/incorrect for SFSafariViewControllerâ€™s to always be on the right side.
