    description: "Summary:\r\nSafariViewController has many huge advantages to UX (shared cookies, disappearing top bar, reader mode), but it's so hard to navigate away from that I'd actually rather every app switch directly to Safari. If an app switches to Safari, I can 3D Touch swipe to return to the app or tap on the status bar back button. But if an app uses SafariViewController, I have to pull down on the content to reveal the top bar (and not too slow, or the bar won't come down), then adjust the grip on my phone so that I can reach the top corner to press the done button. A simple solution (simple in terms of design, a little bit harder in terms of engineering), would be to make the interactive back gesture in SafariViewController dismiss the view controller if you're already at the first page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read content in a SafariViewController modal\r\n2. Try to go back\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's a single gesture to go back\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to scroll down quickly then tap a button in the hard-to-reach top part of the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
