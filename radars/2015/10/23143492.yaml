    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an account I do purchases with for the Mac and iOS 9.0.2: '[account email]'.\r\n\r\nMy account had been locked on the device. I would repeatedly enter my password, and it would fail. I believe the credit card associated with the account had become invalidated (card issuer canceled and sent me a new one for security reasons), but the login failure is often misleadingly inaccurate on my iPhone.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I managed to reset the password via the web, login on the device and update payment info on the device. Then, when I logged in on the device again using [account email], I would find that it said my account was locked.\r\n\r\nI went through the process to unlock it. First, I used the unlock procedure on my Mac. My Mac (iTunes and Mac App Store) were happy using the new credentials. My iPhone was not happy. Even after terminating the Settings and App Store apps on my phone and re-launching them.\r\n\r\nThen, I went through the account unlock procedure on the iPhone itself, thinking there may be some latency with credential tokens from a Mac based reset. I successfully completed the account unlocking procedure right on my iPhone.\r\n\r\nThen, I try to login to the [account email] account in Settings for the App Store on my iPhone, and it tells me the account is locked.\r\n\r\nNo matter what I do, the account is perpetually locked on my iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou won't be able to do this on your account; my account is in some unique limbo state. But essentially, I'm doing this on my iPhone:\r\n\r\n1. Go to Settings iPhone\r\n2. Login to my [account email] account\r\n3. Get hit with a 'Apple ID Locked' message.\r\n4. Select 'Unlock Account'\r\n5. Use security questions successfully to complete verification\r\n6. Choose a new password, which it accepts\r\n7. Login to iTunes and Mac App Store on my Mac, using new credentials. This succeeds.\r\n8. Go to Settings on the iPhone; it needs me to sign in, since no account is persisted.\r\n9. I proceed to sign in. I get hit with Step 3 in an endless loop.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen I pass successful verification of my account, I expect to be able to login without a repeated loop of 'Apple ID Locked'.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am in an endless loop of the Apple ID supposedly being locked, but it is just inaccessible on my iPhone. It is completely unlocked and just fine on my Mac and in using id.apple.com to inspect the account.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm generally finding login failure messages on the iPhone nondescript. Many a times, the issue is with a billing problem, but instead, I'll get some generic login failure message. \r\n\r\nThis are of the UX needs some serious work. And I say this as a developer on the iOS platform and a serious Apple fan. Please bolster the messaging and error flows related to App Store logins on iOS devices.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB purchased unlocked from Apple Store\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0588.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
