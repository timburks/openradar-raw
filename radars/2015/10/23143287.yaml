    description: "Summary:\r\nPioneer DEH-X8500BH - Non-Carplay but Made for iPod/iPhone certified. Everything else functions with the exception of hands free siri usage. This is activated by pressing and holding the main control button on the unit. Siri comes up but does not signal the radio that it has so the radio switches back to playing music. iOS 8.4.1 worked correctly with this unit and since iOS 9 (and continues to 9.1 beta 5) does not function. This presents the end user with a serious and dangerous flaw and removes safety functionality. This should be made high priority to rectify since the unit is MFI certified and functioned correctly in the prior OS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone (5 or 6+ model seems irrelevant) to Pioneer DEH-X8500BH.\r\n2. After unit completes connection; ensure bluetooth is connected in iOS Settings.\r\n3. Press head-unit's main button. Observe Radio attempt to switch and Siri begin to launch. Radio will switch back to prior connection and resume prior operation. iOS Device will time out from siri and display \"Some things you can ask me\" screen. Also, it will be clear the microphone is not switched to the car's internal mic.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRadio and iPhone to switch audio input to Siri and wait for my input.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri comes up and acts like there is no input from radio. Radio does not get confirmation signal so it thinks the hands-free request failed. Thus resumes prior operation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B137)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is more a safety issue than inconvenience. Many states require that in order to use features like navigation, phone calls, etc that a hands-free device be used. iOS 8.4.1 and this radio worked perfectly in that capacity. Now something has changed in iOS 9+ and its breaking hands-free functionality. I would urge that this be escalated as high priority. I will also help as needed to get this corrected before 9.1 release.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, iPhone 6plus, Pioneer DEH-X8500BH"
