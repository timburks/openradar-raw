    description: "Summary:\r\nNot sure what the initial cause for this issue is, but it's happened on multiple projects now. \r\n\r\nAfter a while Xcode will choose to non-stop build the project as long as a .xib file is open. The content of the .xib file does not matter, it can be an empty, newly created file, but it seems to have to be a .xib file and it will start as soon as the file is opened in the editor.\r\nFrom that point on Xcode will continuously build the project not stopping for anything, even if the app is currently running in the iOS simulator. The attached gif shows this, no user input is given during this recording.\r\n\r\nRestarting Xcode has no effect. The problem persists.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open .xib file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Open .xib file.\r\n2. Xcode does not build the project over and over.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Open .xib file.\r\n2. Xcode will start building the project continuously.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0.1 (7A1001)\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'xcode.gif' was successfully uploaded."
