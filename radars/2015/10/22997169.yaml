        Beginning with the watchOS 2.0 release, the Activity app switches to the first view (with a graph of all three rings.)

        This is incredibly annoying because it forces me to constantly swipe to the view I want to see.

        The root of the problem is that my typical day consists of time periods where I’m focusing on one of the three goals. For example, while I’m working at the computer, I will often check Activity to see if it’s a good time to stand.  So I get to swipe-swipe-swipe every couple of hours.

        Then I go to exercise and start focusing on the third view. Swipe-swipe for a hour or so.

        At the end of the day, I go for a walk with my dog, prepare dinner, and sometimes do a short workout to reach my move goal. I have to swipe every time I check.

        This is also a regression from the watchOS 1 behavior. The initial release kept the app in memory much longer so your last view didn’t change. Tapping on the watch complication gave you a quick answer.
