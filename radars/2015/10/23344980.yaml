    description: "When you install an app that you’ve implemented Universal Links for, you get no indication that it has worked.\n\nMobile Safari doesn’t open links in the app even if it is working. I only got it to work when I tried tapping on a link I sent myself in Messages. \n\nI now see that if I pull down in Mobile Safari, it shows you the app name if it worked or if you long press on a link you see the option also. Both of these are hidden gestures but, if documented, this could be sufficient. \n\nBasically, we just need a documented way to test if our implementation of Universal Links worked or not. This could be a debugger trace or one of the methods, above, being included in the documentation.\n\n(I just spent half a day trying to get Universal Links to work when it was apparently working all along — just not in Safari, For Some Reason™) :)"
