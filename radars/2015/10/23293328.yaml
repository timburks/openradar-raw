        Summary:
        Creating an NSURLRequest object with an NSURL doesn't keep the relative URL info on its URL property. A copy does remove that info as well.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        let foo = NSURL(string: "https://www.foo.com/")!
        let bar = NSURL(string: "bar", relativeToURL: foo)!
        let foobar = NSURLRequest(URL: bar)
        foobar.URL!.baseURL == nil

        Expected Results:
        The URL property of the NSURLRequest to have the same baseURL as the one used to create it.

        Actual Results:
        The request had a nil URL!.baseURL

        Regression:
        I'm not sure if it was the same on earlier SDKs
