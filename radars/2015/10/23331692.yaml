    description: "After upgrading to server.app 5.0.15 and OSX 10.11.1 Adding an OSX server account under the internet accounts preference pane results in authentication errors.  The server's password service error log reports 'algorithm' must be 'md5' or 'md5-sess'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an OSX Server with services like mail, messages, etc etc\r\n2. Log in to a client computer as a local network user\r\n3. Try to add OS X server account via internet accounts\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected that the server would accept the credentials and add the server account to the work station\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser gets an error saying credentials are incorrect \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0.15\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have found replacing mod_auth_digest_apple.so with the version from Server.app 4 resolves the problem.  \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X Server.app 5.0.15 on Mac mini with 10.11.1 installed \r\nClient computer with 10.11.1 installed\r\nAlso tested with a 10.10.5 client"
