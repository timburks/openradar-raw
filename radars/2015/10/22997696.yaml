    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a Live Photo on the \"Photo\" Watch face, a wrist raise does not cause the entire Live Photo Video to display. Instead, it shows less than 1 second of the Live Photo video. Although, a tap-and-hold on the Watch face does play the entire 3 second video. It would be delightful if the entire 3 sec Live Photo would play on a wrist raise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select the \"Photo\" Watch face.\r\n2. Select a Live Photo as the Watch face.\r\n3. Lower wrist, then raise wrist to cause the Watch face to turn on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Watch face should turn on and the entire 3 second Live Photo video should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Watch face turns on and displays less than 1 second of the Live Photo video.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2.0 (13S344)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nVideos demonstrating the issue are attached.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n42mm Apple Watch Sport (model MJ3T2LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Wrist raise only shows less than 1 sec of live photo.MOV' and 'Tap and hold plays full 3 sec live photo.MOV' were successfully uploaded."
