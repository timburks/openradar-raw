    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a localized system, having a Volume called „Documents“ is expected to be shown as „Dokumente“ (German) if there is a .localized (I always created it by running touch .localized on the volume). Now .localized only works for directories but not Volumes anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a volume, call it eg Documents and put a .localized on it. On 10.10, it correctly shows localized, on 10.11, it doesn’t.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLocalization happening.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo localization on volumes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nRegression from 10.10.x. With 10.11.1 it is broken.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
