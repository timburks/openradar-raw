    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen UISearchController is used in a view in a popover presentation that adapts from popover to full screen, the table view ends up inset 20 points lower than expected.\r\n\r\nIt appears the status bar inset is applied twice: once by the navigation controller and once by the search presentation controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project\r\n2. Run the app on iPad Air 2\r\n3. Follow the instructions in the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter cancelling, the top of the search bar should be aligned with the bottom of the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search bar is 20 points too low. Indeed, the whole table view content is inset 20 points from the top.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 Xcode 7.1 (7B91b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SearchStatusBarInset.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nIf you look carefully, the table content is 20 points too low immediately after rotation, but it isn’t easy to see until search is cancelled. You can get a good sense of what’s going on by logging or setting a breakpoint in the table view’s `setContentInset:`."
