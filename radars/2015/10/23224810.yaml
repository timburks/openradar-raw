    description: "The old Android \"Browser\", Google Chrome/Android, Firefox/Android, Firefox/FirefoxOS, IE/Windows Phone 8.x, Edge/Windows 10 Mobile all feature an option in their settings to allow users to force a webpage to be zoomable, even if the developer has specified a non-zoomable viewport (e.g. using user-scalable=no, or identical minimum-scale and maximum-scale values). This (accessibility-related) setting is sorely missed from iOS/Safari\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. visit a \"mobile-optimized\" site that forces a non-zoomable viewport (e.g. using user-scalable=no)\r\n2. attempt to zoom\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBy default, the browser should honor the developer's indication that the page should not be user-scalable. However, a user should have a way of overriding this - for instance, a low-vision user may wish to zoom a page, rather than using iOS-wide zooming which also affects all browser/OS UI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser has no way of forcing zoom.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor info, here's the (now closed) bug for Firefox to add this setting https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852247\r\n\r\nThis request is particularly in light of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149968 which may result in developers taking the easy way out to shave off the 350ms delay on their mobile sites by simply making them non-scalable, causing accessibility issues along the way..."
