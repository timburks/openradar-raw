        Summary:

        Attempting to set a wi-fi HTTP proxy server in Settings.app > Wi-Fi does not work; settings are not honoured or remembered

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open Settings.app
        2. Tap on the (i) button for the connected Wi-Fi network
        3. Scroll to the bottom
        4. Select “Manual” HTTP Proxy
        5. Key in valid proxy server details
        6. Navigate back
        7. Go back into the Wi-Fi configuration and scroll down
        8. Observe Manual proxy settings are not remembered
        9. Launch Safari
        10. Navigate to a web page and observe the proxy server entered is never contacted.

        Expected Results:

        I would expect HTTP proxy server settings to continue working as they did in iOS 9

        Actual Results:

        Proxy server settings are not honoured or saved.

        Regression:

        Last saw this working in iOS 9.
