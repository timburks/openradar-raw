    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen no windows are open, using Command-1 through Command-9 to open pinned tabs is a no-op.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari 9 on El Capitan 10.11.0.\r\n2. Pin one or more tabs using the new tab pinning feature.\r\n3. Confirm that Command-1 through Command-n where n ≤ (number of pinned tabs) works to switch to the pinned tabs.\r\n4. Close all open Safari windows, but don’t quit Safari.\r\n5. Type Command-1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new window opens with the first pinned tab selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPrior to Safari 9, using Command-1 through Command-9 worked to open your first nine bookmark favorites, even if there was no window open. In Safari preferences → Tabs, if you uncheck “Use ⌘-1 through ⌘-9 to switch tabs”, then Command-1 through Command-9 go back to their old behavior of opening the first nine favorites, even with no windows open initially."
