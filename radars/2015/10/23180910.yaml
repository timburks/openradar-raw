    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you tap snooze on an exchange calendar event notification the device puts a value of \"-9 minutes and some seconds\" in the advice field of the appointment. It causes stop syncing the calendar event because it sends to Exchange a malformed data value. I have extracted the value in the ActiveSync trace log and the malformed data corresponds to <Reminder xmlns=\"Calendar:\">-9</Reminder>. It happens also with Google account but Google to workaround this behavior add a second advice to appointment, and this is not possbile for Exchange.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 add Exchange account\r\n2 add an event to Exchange calendar and set advice at \"at time of Event\"\r\n3 wait until the notify pop's up and tap on snooze\r\n4 You will notice that in the event detail you will find an advice value of 9 minutes and some seconds\r\n5 Drag it with finger to another hour\r\n6 Access your Exchange account web page (OWA) and you will notice that the events remains in the old position\r\n7 from now every changes to this appointment are not synced with Exchange except if you change the advice to a default value\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsync appointment after snooze\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ndoesn't sync appointment after snooze\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue appears since ios 8.0. Attached file contains DataAccess, Calendar, datetime and mobilecal\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIphone 6 16GB wifi/3G/LTE"
