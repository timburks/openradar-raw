    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22786605\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe always connected 4th gen AppleTV with its tvOS is a superb companion for iOS devices. But the connection is severely limited due to its missing MultiPeerConnectivity framework.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlease reconsider and provide the same MultiPeerConnectivity API/framework on tvOS too."
