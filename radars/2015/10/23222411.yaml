    description: "Summary:\r\nSee title.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Instantiate Spotlight with Command+Tab.\r\n2. Start typing query. I.e., “Google Chrome”.\r\n3. After first letter is typed, cursor is moved to beginning of string. Example: assuming “|” represents the cursor, I see “|G”\r\n4. After next character is typed, “G” is deleted and only “oogle Chrome” makes it through.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCursor is always placed at end of search query, hence prevented parts of query from being deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor is moved to beginning of string when first typing query."
