    description: "Summary:\r\nWas surprised to find my son had burned through 5GB of data on his T-Mobile plan. We checked his Cellular Settings and Ceullular Data was off. All apps showed as \"disabled\" but at the very bottom Wi-Fi Assist was on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure iOS 8 device with Cellular Data off\r\n2. Upgrade to iOS 9\r\n3. Note Wi-Fi Assist is on\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Disable Cellular Data in Cellular Settings\r\n2. Note Wi-Fi Assist remains on (should be disabled)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCellular Data off means, really, no cellular data allowed. It should not be possible to burn cellular data by accident as a result of upgrading to iOS 9.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy son's T-Mobile account is locked down for the rest of the month because we upgraded to iOS 9 and didn't think to disable Wi-Fi Assist."
