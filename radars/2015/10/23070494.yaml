    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter running Xcode (and specifically the iOS Simulator) for a while (across many builds), I eventually start to get errors pertaining to starting new processes (e.g “posix _spawn failed” or failures to run /bin/sh) when I build and run my app. Quitting some open applications will sometimes help, and a reboot will always help. I’ve attached a sysdiagnose, in case that’s helpful. Sometimes Xcode will crash and get into a cycle of not being able to relaunch until I quit another app (often the Simulator, but quitting other apps has the same effect)."
