        Summary:
        When setting the UITabBarController property multiple times, UIKit will leak an instance of the private class _UIIdleModeLayoutAttributes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the attached TabBarLeak project (based on Xcode's Tabbed Application template)
        2. Profile the app with Instrument attached
        3. Use the "Leaks" instrument
        4. Touch the "Add second ViewController" button multiple times.

        Expected Results:
        No memory is leaked.

        Actual Results:
        After the first touch, the second view controller is added to the tab bar. In subsequent touches, an instance of _UIIdleModeLayoutAttributes is leaked.

        Regression:
        No leaks in version prior to iOS 9.1.

        Notes:
        Attached are a screenshot of the leak in Instruments, and a minimal project reproducing the problem.
