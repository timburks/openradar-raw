    description: "Summary:\nServer 5.0.15 update never finishes\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nRun Server 5.0.4, Update to 5.0.15 when prompted from the App Store. Update Server.app and launch it.\nServer update migration begins and is stuck at one of the multiple “Updating Calendar Service”.\n\nExpected Results:\nServer migration should finish. At least after several hours. \n\nActual Results:\nServer.app just hangs there for hours, never finishes.\n\nRegression:\nCalendar Service was broken since 5.0.2 (5.0.0 never released) and 5.0.4 broke it even more due to certificate issues.\nCalendar Service was not even in use on that server, since it didn't work at all anyway.\n\nNotes:\nIt's really hard to imagine new ways in which a Server.app update could break even more things by now. Yet, Apple manages to prove sysadmins wrong with each and every update."
