    description: "David Spector 20-Oct-2015 11:28 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMetadata rejections can represent a serious business issue for app developers who depend on as-timely-as-possible delivery of their applications to service their customers.\r\n\r\nThe submission process should scan your keywords/description and warn of possible issues so the dev has a chance to fix them and avoid a metadata rejection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs part of the submission process the app record's keywords and app description and warn of possible issues. The developer can then either review and/or change the items flagged, or leave the submission as-is and hope that it was a false/spurious warning.\r\n\r\n... of course there still could be other metadata or app issues that lead to a rejection, but an automated system to help preempt the most common metadata rejections would be a great help to all developers and by extension provide better service to our customers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou won't know until your app is reviewed if the app review team objects to something then you are sent to the back of the queue when you re-submit ... which then of course takes however long it takes get to get to front of the queue again wasting valuable develop time and keeping the latest software release from customers. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
