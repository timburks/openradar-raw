    description: "Summary:\r\nSpell checker doesn't have a brain. The difference between \"pastrami\" and what I actually typed is vast.\r\n\r\nThe spell checker should take cues from what has been seen before in an email thread, and also should insert spaces if it thinks a compound noun should be two words rather than one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive email from postroom.\r\n2. Reply to email.\r\n3. Ask if there's something in the postroom for me.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Is there something in the postroom for me?\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Is there something in the pastrami for me?\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n14D136"
