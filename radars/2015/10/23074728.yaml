        Summary:
        I would like to sync one of my shared albums to my personal album, that way all the photos that my friends add to my shared album, I can keep and they auto add to my library.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a shared album
        2. Create a personal album
        3. Add photos to both albums.

        Expected Results:
        1. Create a personal album
        2. Share the personal album
        3. Any photos added to the shared album auto import to your personal album and library

        Actual Results:
        1. When importing the photos from a shared album you can end up with duplicates, because you do not know which ones were already imported.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
