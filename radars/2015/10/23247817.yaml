    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be super helpful if Wallet née Passbook would support EAN based bar codes. I could scan a lot of loyalty cards myself and use them. But QR codes and the other bar codes supported are never spottable here in Germany. Ideally, a simple „scan your card code, we will show it then, you can edit info here“ option would be super helpful. At least provide support for EAN based codes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to create a pass for an EAN based card.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally, scan an existing loyalty card’s barcode, enter some info I want and put the card in the drawer at home.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot compatible at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
