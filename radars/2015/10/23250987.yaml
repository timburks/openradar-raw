    description: "Summary:\r\nI can't activate a build for external testers. When i try to i get the following error back (found in dev tools) from the server:\r\n{\"data\":null,\"messages\":{\"warn\":null,\"info\":null,\"error\":[\"operation_failed\"]},\"statusCode\":\"ERROR\"}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to an app > testflight > external testing\r\nSelect a build\r\nClick \"Start Testing\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected build should be active for testing and testers should be notified\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe settings are not saved and the servers return an error. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nChrome, Safari, iOS safari, Firefox, (all of them)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe interface even shows as if everything went fine, but in dev tools there is a 500 error from the server, and after a refresh it shows the settings wasn't saved. At least show errors in plain sight. I left thinking everything went fine, and then after a while wondered why no notification of the new test build had arrived, only to come back and find settings were never saved (and then finding the errors in dev tools)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny browser, any device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
