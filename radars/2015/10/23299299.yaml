        Summary:
        TestFlight continues to limit our ability to test our own apps before releasing them to the App Store, which then can result in dramatic consequences (see rdar://22705745 for a very clear example).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        (see attached video)

        - Install an app through TestFlight (either internal or external testing).
        - Tap on “Install on Apple Watch”

        Expected Results:
        - The app installs on your watch.

        Actual Results:
        - It doesn’t, and there’s no error whatsoever.

        Regression:
        This has NEVER worked for watchOS2 apps. I was hoping it would just be a beta issue, but it never got fixed.

        Notes:
        Nothing gets output to the device log, either on my iPhone or my Apple Watch.

        I think rdar://22705745 is a good example of why TestFlight is extremely critical at finding things that can go wrong in an (almost) App Store environment. Apple shouldn’t continue ignoring TestFlight problems (like rdar://22999921, which is still open and limiting our ability to submit apps), or else developers will continue to ship apps that do not work in production.
