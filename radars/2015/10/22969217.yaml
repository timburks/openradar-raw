    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempting to use GKMatchmaker's startBrowsingForNearbyPlayersWithHandler method to discover other devices using the same app, but the handler is never called. In addition none of the delegate methods from GKLocalPlayerListener are called. \r\n\r\nThe app has been configured in iTunes Connect to use Game Centre, and has the correct entitlements and provision profile. The issue is happening on actual devices. The local player has been authenticated. The devices are signed into two separate game centre Sandbox accounts (devices+what@3sidedcube and devices+what2@3sidedcube.com).\r\n\r\nTried having both devices calling startBrowsingForNearbyPlayersWithHandler at the same time, and also tried only having one device browsing. Still no players are discovered. \r\n\r\nPer suggestion of DST support, we simplified the networking environment. We setup an Airport Time Capsule (model A1302) with the default settings. We then connected the same modern iPhones running iOS 9.0.1 to it. We ensured all devices were on the same subnet (see attached screenshots). Still no joy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached sample project\r\n2. Run project on two separate iPhones at the same time.\r\n3. startBrowsingForNearbyPlayersWithHandler method is called. \r\n4. No players are ever returned. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNearby players on the same network to be returned. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo players returned. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 (7A220) iOS 9.0.1 (13A404)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 (A1586) iPhone 6 Plus (A1524) Airport Time Capsule (A1302)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Things.zip' was successfully uploaded."
