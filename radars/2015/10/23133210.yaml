    description: "I’ve had mixed luck answering phone calls on my iPhone for the last 18 months or so. Sometimes it works fine, but sometimes the screen is completely unresponsive to touch and I’m unable to swipe the “swipe to answer” puck. When it doesn’t work, there is no response from the UI at all. \n\nI’d say the failure rate is about 40% of calls.\n\nThis has been happening now across three different physical phones of different models and several iOS releases. The only common thread is that there’s one backup configuration that has been propagated from phone to phone.\n\nI have a vague suspicion that the problem is more likely to occur when the charger or earbuds are plugged into the phone, but I couldn’t swear to that.\n\nI realize this isn’t much to go on, but is there a profile I can install to capture more detail about this problem? I’d be happy to investigate it further."
