    description: "I should be able to block certain types of network requests across all processes running on iOS.\r\n\r\nI have privacy concerns about third party analytics tools that are bundled inside nearly all popular apps on the App Store.\r\n\r\nAs a user, I would like the ability to deny network requests to Crashlytics, Omniture, comScore, Localytics, Flurry, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Facebook Analytics, App Annie, AppBoy, Medialets, and Applause, to name just a few.\r\n\r\nBetter than blocking network requests, I would like to be able to deny those frameworks from executing.\r\n\r\nThey cause huge numbers of crashes, eat up user bandwidth and battery life, and exploit any weaknesses that may occur in the iOS privacy and security model. They are written poorly and provide no benefit to users.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n-Alex Fajkowski"
