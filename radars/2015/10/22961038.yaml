    description: "Summary:\r\nFirst version was published in May. \r\n\r\nAn update was published on 28 Aug and went live on 31st August. This is following the recommendation that the apps should be updated in order to correct the identifierForVendor value. Users were advised to re-enrol.\r\n \r\nAnother update was submitted and went live on 30th Sept. The identifierForVendor is still incorrect. Prompting the users to re-enrol the second second or more time. \r\n\r\nidentifierForVendor value was used as part of encryption in our app as a means to bind the data to the device. However, with different values, we won't be able to decrypt them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the app. \r\n2. Enroll. User would need a registration code from the bank. \r\n3. At this point a secret data is received from the bank server and gets encrypted with a set of keys. Among which is the value of identifierForVendor in order to bind the data to the device. \r\n4. Perform app update. \r\n5. The app becomes unusable because the data does not get decrypted correctly due to different value of identifierForVendor now. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should be able to decrypt the data correctly. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to decrypt the data. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 6.2.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone with iOS version 7 and above.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nMarked duplicate of issue 22584428 but didn't give details about it. \r\n\r\nRelated to: https://openradar.appspot.com/22677034"
