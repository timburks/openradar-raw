        Summary:
        Methods defined in protocol extensions cannot be found via Open Quickly.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add a protocol and an extension with a method to an Xcode project:

        protocol P {}

        extension P {
        	func unambiguousNameToFindViaOpenQuickly() {}
        }

        2. Open the Open Quickly window.
        3. Type in the name of the method added via the protocol extension.


        Expected Results:
        I expected the unambiguousNameToFindViaOpenQuickly method to be listed in the Open Quickly window.

        There were no results.
