    description: "If you have localization on the watch extension (even empty strings files), the only part of WCSession that seems to work is sending data via the applicationContext. The transferUserInfo method just queues up data and it is never sent. The sendMessage function is also unreliable in this case.\r\nClosed as duplicate of 22682390"
