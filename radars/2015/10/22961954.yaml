        Summary:
        This morning I attempted to play songs from the album “The Real Thing: Word and Sounds Vol. 3” by Jill Scott and my phone told me the song was unavailable. I paid for this album and now I’m not able to listen to it because I signed up for Apple Music?

        Looking around the internet, it doesn’t seem to have been removed form the iTunes Store or from Apple Music, so what gives?

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open the Music app on your phone.
        - Enable Apple Music and Music in the Cloud
        - Try to play songs from  “The Real Thing: Word and Sounds Vol. 3” by Jill Scott
        - Get an error where you can’t play the song, even if you paid for it.

        Expected Results:
        You should be listening to Jill Scott’s lovely voice now.

        Actual Results:
        You get some vague error about not being able to play the song.

        Regression:
        This worked fine before Apple Music got involved with the music I own.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
