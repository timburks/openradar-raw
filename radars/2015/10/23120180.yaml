    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a meticulously maintained address book, many contacts will have multiple numbers. For example, one contact could have a work number, a mobile number (for an iPhone), a fax number, etc. When someone uses messages and starts a new message to someone that has multiple numbers, it's impossible to tell which one of those numbers is which. This could cause text messages to be sent to fax machines unless one takes the time to switch to Address Book and find the correct number they should be using.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new contact named \"John Appleseed\"\r\n2. Give the new contact two different phone numbers with one being a mobile number and the other labeled as a work number\r\n3. Switch to Messages and start a new message\r\n4. Start typing \"John Appl\" and both numbers will pop up with an option to text message the number but there will be no indication of which is which.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should see the labels they've assigned to all of their contacts' numbers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAre unable to see the labels you've assigned to the contacts' various numbers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 release and at least all versions of OS X since 10.9.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshot of iOS in the same situation. It shows the necessary details."
