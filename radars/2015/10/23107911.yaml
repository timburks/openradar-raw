    description: "Summary:\nVoiceControl still can't be turned off completly.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSearch though all of iOS Settings.app to find a way to completely turn OFF VoiceControl. (Not Siri, that old VoiceControl thing.)\n\nExpected Results:\nFind a switch somewhere deeply buried in Settings that I can turn OFF to prevent VoiceControl from ever activating.\n\nActual Results:\nFail to find a switch that allows you to turn off this feature.\n\nRegression:\nThis has been the case since VoiceControl was introduced. It's still missing in iOS 9 and 9.1 betas.\n\n\nNotes:\nThis attack vector also applies to VoiceControl, not only Siri. BUT Siri CAN be turned off, Voice Control can't be turned off.\nhttp://www.wired.com/2015/10/this-radio-trick-silently-hacks-siri-from-16-feet-away/\nNot only does this leave any iOS device vulnerable, but also without a way to mitigate.\n\nFurther: VoiceControl is frequently triggered without my intention to do so. This pauses any audio/video playback, like Music, PodCasts, etc. which then often can't be resumed without entering the playing application again and find the play button. \n\nFuthermore VoiceControl is also always available from the Lock screen, with and without a headset. This allows calls to be made, data to be exfiltrated and is a general security and privacy issue. Yet, Apple has failed to mitigate this. (This is not the first time this has been filedâ€¦)"
