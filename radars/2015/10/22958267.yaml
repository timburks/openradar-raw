    description: "Summary:\nWhen I upload multiple screenshots to an iTunes Connect app record, they should appear in a deterministic order. Ideally, that order would match the Finder.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Drag three to five suitably-sized screenshots from the Finder to a iTunes Connect app record. \n2. Delete them, and do it again.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe order in which screenshots appear should be predictable and consistent.\n\nActual Results:\nThe order in which screenshots appear seems to depend on the order in which they finished uploading. In any case, itâ€™s not predictable.\n\nRegression:\nTo the best my knowledge the display order has always been pretty random.\n\nNotes:\nI tested this today on Safari 9.0 (10601.1.56.2), on 10.10.5."
