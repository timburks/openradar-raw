    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you turn off email notifications in TestFlight for a given app, iOS notifications also get turned off as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRegister for a TestFlight beta. Send in a test build with default settings. You’ll get an email notification and an on-device notification. Go into the app in the TestFlight app and at the bottom hit notifications, turn off just the email notifications, and send yourself another test build. You won’t get an email but you also won’t get the on-device notification. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTurning off email notifications should not turn off on-device notifications also.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notifications of any kind were sent.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
