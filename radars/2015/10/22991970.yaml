    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen compiled with iOS8 SDK.  Importing a contact on iOS9 that is linked to other contacts cause a crash. Specifically, when calling ABPersonCopyArrayOfAllLinkedPeople on iOS9 (when using a build compiled using iOS8 SDK) a crash is thrown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Link minimum TWO contacts on local device contacts \r\n(on iphone, click Phone then Contacts\r\nopen one of the contacts, then click EDIT, scroll down and click the linkable link under Linked Contacts)\r\n\r\n- Create contact1 & 2 first, last name - save. This should be done on phone contacts as described above in paranthesis.\r\n- Edit contact1, scroll down to linked contacts, select 'link contacts' link and search for Contact2 created, click LINK, Done\r\n\r\n2) In app, import the contact using the ABPersonPickerNavigationController\r\n3) search for linked contacts created step 1 and you will see app crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen building with iOS8 SDK app should not crash on iOS9.  Specifically, shouldn't crash using ABPersonCopyArrayOfAllLinkedPeople on iOS9 using a build with iOS8SDK.  It is understood that ABPersonCopyArrayOfAllLinkedPeople is deprecated in iOS9, but this is happening when compelling with iOS8 SDK.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash happens when using ABPersonCopyArrayOfAllLinkedPeople on iOS9 using a build with iOS8 SDK.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI noticed in ABPerson.h it has a comment saying to use predicateForContactsLinkedToContact: for the new iOS9 SDK. However, predicateForContactsLinkedToContact is not exposed as a public method in iOS9 SDK.  In iOS9 SDK should this method be expose?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis can be replicated on any iOS9+ device iPhone5s, iPhone6 / 6+\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
