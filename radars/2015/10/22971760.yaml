    description: "05-Oct-2015 06:12 PM\r\n\r\nThe logs will frequently contain errors like this: 10/5/15 6:06:26.000 PM kernel[0]: disk4: alignment error.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisk alignment errors do _not_ appear in any prior versions of OS X.\r\n\r\nI can now confirm that this issue is new as of OS X 10.11. Using the same drive on 10.9 has no issues.\r\n\r\nI can create an encrypted volume manually through the diskutility command line which will get it up and running. However, as it stands it is impossible to initiate a backup to these Seagate drives from Time Machine.\r\n\r\nI have two identical Seagate 4 TB Expansion Desk Drives. This issue reproduces on both on 10.11 on two Macs. The same two drives worked just fine in previous OS X version 10.10 and prior AND continue to work just fine on OS X. I tested the same drive in a 10.9 virtual machine and it worked just fine.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n05-Oct-2015 08:51 AM\r\n\r\n\r\nImpossible to format and encrypt a new disk for Time Machine in El Capitan GM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Watch the attached video\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect this to work. Basic functionality 101.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nShitty experience and non-functional software. Refer to video for the horror because I am too pissed to write it out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo issues on 10.10 and prior with this same hardware configuration.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n4 TB Seagate External Hard Drive connected via USB 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2015.10.05_08-39-58-0600_547.tar.gz' and 'DiskUtility is Crummy.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
