        If you include more than 1000 webcredentials domains in an apps entitlements file, the app crashes on launch without reason. I only found this by trying a different number of domains repeatedly.

        While 1000 domains seems like a lot, for our purposes it is required. associated-domains does not support any form of wildcard, and Safari seems to ignore the domain of the cookies a site returns, so even though the website shares credentials between all of itâ€™s subdomains, the app has to specify each subdomain explicitly. For our service, each client has their own subdomain, and each client has hundreds, and possibly thousands of users.
