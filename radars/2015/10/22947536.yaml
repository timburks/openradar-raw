    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a team each developer has its own development certificate. These development certificates can be connected to all manually created development profiles. When a team member is removed from the team and the member's development certificate is revoked subsequently, then all the provisioning profiles connected to the former member's development certificate are set to invalid and need to be regenerated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf a member is removed from the team and the member's development certificate is revoked then all related provisioning profiles should be updated automatically. At least they should not be set to invalid for other team members.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThe error has its origin in the provisioning profile / certificate management at developer portal. Thus it affects all versions of Xcode."
