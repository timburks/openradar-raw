        Summary:
        The passwords button on top of the keyboard when editing a field in the Captive Network Assistant will present an Action Sheet that never contains anything but a “Other Passwords…” button. Tapping the “Other Passwords…” button closes the Captive Network Assistant and disconnects from the WiFi.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Connect to a Captive Network
        2. In the Captive Network select an input field
        3. Tap the “Passwords” button
        4. Tap the “Other Passwords…” button in the action sheet that appears

        Expected Results:
        I would expect to be able to open 1Password, Dashlane or some other password manager.

        Actual Results:
        Captive Network Assistant is closed, WiFi is disconnected.
