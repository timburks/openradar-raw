    description: "Summary:\r\nI ran into an unexpected (for me) behaviour of property observers today, where a property observer is triggered whenever you access a computed property of the property for which the observer is added.\r\n\r\nSay you have a protocol A which defines a get property x. You then create a class AImpl, in which you conform to the protocol by means of a computed property. Now, in yet another class B, you define a property p of type A and give it a didSet property observer.\r\n\r\nObserved behaviour:\r\nWhenever you access p inside a member function of A, the property observer will be triggered.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nWhenever you access p inside a member function of A, the property observer will NOT be triggered.\r\n\r\nIf instead we define a property q of type Aimpl, the observed behaviour is as expected: the property observer will NOT be triggered whenever you access q inside a member function of A.\r\n\r\nSee the attached playground for a reproducible case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Playground\r\n2. Run the Playground\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text “Observed property observer called” is printed only once: when we set the property/\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text “Observed property observer called” is printed twice: when we set the property as well as when we access it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nExample playground can also be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/larslockefeer/Radars/blob/master/UnexpectedPropertyObserverBehaviour.playground/Contents.swift"
