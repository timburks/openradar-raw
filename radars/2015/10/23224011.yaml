        Summary:

        Xcode code coverage reports that the last line of a function hasn't been
        hit when it is impossible to reach because of an else statement above.

        Steps to reproduce:

        1. Create a function that contains an if/else statement
        2. Return from both halves of the if statement
        3. Write tests that hit each half of the if
        4. View the code coverage

        OR:

        1. Run the tests in the example project
        2. View the code coverage

        Expected results:

        Code coverage should be 100%

        Actual results:

        Code coverage reports that you're missing the last line of your
        function, which is unreachable.

        Notes:

        See coverage.png for the incorrect reporting.
