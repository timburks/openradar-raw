    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nswiftc crashes when there is a function signature mismatch between a\r\nsubscript defined in a protocol and the implmentation of that subscript\r\nfunction in a class inheriting from the protocol.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run `swiftc subscriptCrash.swift`\r\n\r\nOR:\r\n\r\n1. Create a protocol which specifies a subscript function with 2\r\n   arguments. Make sure the second argument has a label\r\n2. Conform to this protocol from a class, by remove the argument or\r\n   label from the definition in the class\r\n3. Attempt to run `swiftc` on your file\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nA compiler error that the subscript signature in the implementation does\r\nnot match that expected from the protocol is produced.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nThe compiler crashes, giving no obvious sign that there is a signature\r\nmismatch.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- This is fixed immediately by fixing the implementation's signature"
