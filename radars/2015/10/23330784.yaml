    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder El Capitan, it is not possible to connect to an ssh server using GSS without a work around, as the openSSH client crashes during key exchange.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Enable GSSAPI in the OpenSSH client by uncommenting the following in /etc/ssh/ssh_config:\r\n   GSSAPIAuthentication yes\r\n   GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes\r\n   GSSAPIKeyExchange yes\r\n\r\n2) (Optional) Obtain a Kerberos ticket using kinit or other means.\r\n\r\n3) Attempt to connect to an SSH server supporting GSS\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGSSAPI authentication should happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe openSSH client crashes, with the error: ssh_dispatch_run_fatal: Connection to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx: unexpected internal error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDisabling GSSAPIKeyExchange acts as a partial, undesirable work around (in that, key exchange is no longer performed with GSSAPI).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
