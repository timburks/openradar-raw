    description: "Summary:\r\nSince updating to El Cap ejecting my Time Machine external hard drive from my laptop has not worked once.\r\n\r\nI have simply been rebooting and unplugging it while it is off. However, today I had a lot open I did not want to have to reload/reopen so I decided to track down the problem.\r\n\r\nThe drive in question is named \"Kyles HD\"\r\n\r\nRunning: sudo lsof | grep /Volumes/Kyles\r\nrevealed that all the open files were from in \".Spotlight-V100\".\r\n\r\nQuitting the \"mds\" can \"mds_store\" programs in Activity Indicator allowed the hard drive to eject instantly without issue.\r\n\r\nI have attached the log of the output from lsof.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect an external hard drive\r\nUse your computer for a while.\r\nTry to eject the drive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe drive will eject successfully after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEven with no applications running (as shown in the dock) at all, it will fail to eject and say that something is using it.\r\n\r\nRunning \"sudo lost\" reveals the culprit to be Spotlight.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro 2010, with the 1TB USB hard drive plugged and being used solely for TimeMachine \r\n\r\nterminal_log.txt - configuration file has been successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'terminal_log.txt' was successfully uploaded."
