        Summary:

        Private functions show up in code coverage with a arbitrary string
        identifier after their name.

        Steps to reproduce:

        1. Create a public function that calls a private function
        2. Write a test that calls the public function
        3. View the code coverage

        OR:

        1. Run the tests in the example project
        2. View the code coverage

        Expected results:

        The code coverage should (possibly) have something to identify that
        function as private, but it should not be a random string.

        Actual results:

        The private function has a long string of characters after it's
        declaration.

        Notes:

        See coverage.png for an example.
