    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a terminated app (which uses SPR) is deleted and replaced by a new version of the app, SPR data from the old app, still has a 'secret life' in the background, running in parallel with the new version of the app. \r\nThis makes our app unstable an unpredictable. It will not always start, when one of our BT Low Energy devices is transmitting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI think a simple way to reproduce the problem\r\n* Start a BT LE app\r\n* Terminate the app (we use a simple KILL button, to simulate memory pressure termination)\r\n* Delete the app (not close)\r\n* Install a new app version with TestFlight\r\n* Do not open the app\r\n* Double-click the home button - You will see that the app is already running, without being started.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen an app is deleted, make sure all data from State Preservation is removed as well. Otherwise the app becomes unstable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHere is one way we discovered the problem:\r\n* Our app was safely closed (double-click + swipe up)\r\n* We made a phone reset (hold home + power)\r\n* When the phone was running again, our app was also running, even though it was safely closed just before the reset."
