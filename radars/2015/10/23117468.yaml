        The Apple Watch Programming Guide shows information for storing settings that is no longer valid in watchOS 2.x

        https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/Settings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014969-CH22-SW1

        In particular, this doesn’t work anymore:

        NSUserDefaults *defaults = [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteName:@"group.example.MyWatchKitApp"];
        BOOL enabled = [defaults boolForKey:@"enabled_preference"];

        The only reference to this change is in the transition guide:

        https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppleWatch2TransitionGuide/UpdatetheAppCode.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015234-CH6-SW4

        Many developer sites have outdated information. For example:

        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27007288/watchkit-sdk-not-retrieving-data-from-nsuserdefaults/27007346#27007346
        http://blog.curtisherbert.com/data-synchronization-with-watchkit/

        I don’t expect you to fix external sites, but the “Apple Watch Programming Guide” should be a definitive source of information. There is not even a hint that these capabilities have changed in the most recent release.

        I spent hours thinking I had a provisioning problem before I realized that the two devices had different persistent domains (and that they weren’t being synced.)
