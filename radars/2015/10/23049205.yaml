    description: "Summary:\r\nIn 10.10 and earlier, something like:\r\n    AudioObjectPropertyAddress propertyAddress = {\r\n        kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices,\r\n        kAudioObjectPropertyScopeWildcard,\r\n        kAudioObjectPropertyElementWildcard\r\n    };\r\ncould be used with AudioObjectGetPropertyData to enumerate all of the connected audio devices, and it would include a device named \"AirPlay\" which had data sources corresponding to each AirPlay device present on the user's network.\r\n\r\nIn 10.11 this no longer seems to be possible - the AirPlay device does not show up in the list, and even if an AudioDeviceID reference to it is created using kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice with a UID of \"AirPlay\", no data sources exist, and the device does not seem to be capable of being used in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nFrom some light investigation of what the AppleVolumeExtra menu extra is doing to obtain a list of AirPlay endpoints for system audio, it seems as though it is using AVFoundation to obtain information about available output devices, but it doesn't seem to be public API.\r\n\r\nCould we please return to having public API for this, it would be useful for apps that want to do fun audio things with AirPlay that fall outside AVPlayer. It would also be useful for utility apps that want to be able to let users configure audio devices (including, it should be noted, Apple's Audio MIDI Setup.app, which can no longer inspect/control AirPlay devices).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
