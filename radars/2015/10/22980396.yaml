    description: "Controls in view controllers inside UIPageViewController don't work as expected. The scroll view takes any swipes even when over a control like a slider. I'd like to be able to set controls as having a stronger priority than the scroll view itself. The normal way to do this is with the delaysContentTouches property. This should be exposed as part of UIPageViewController's interface. This would potentially be similar to how UIWebView exposes its underlying UIScrollView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIPageViewController with UIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll.\r\n2. Create a child page view controller.\r\n3. Add a UISlider to your page view controller.\r\n4. Run your app\r\n5. Try to slide the slider.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe slider moves\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page scrolls."
