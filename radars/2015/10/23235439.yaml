    description: "Summary:\n\nThe Photo Album watch face is very cool. I like seeing a different random picture whenever I look at my watch. However, often times the position of the photo does not work well on the watch face. The date/time in the top-left corner will obscure it, or make it off centre.\n\nWhen I make a watch face out of a single photo, I can do exactly what I want already:\n- Zoom in slightly\n- Pan the image around\n- Force touch and tap Create Watch Face.\n\nFurthermore, I don’t necessary want *every* photo that synced onto my watch to potentially be a watch face. I would like to hand pick the ones that are watch faces. Some work well, some don’t.\n\nWhat I would like is the ability to slightly edit the ones that show up in the Photo album in the same way. Basically all the functionality I want already exists, it just needs to be combined in the right way.\n\nYou guys are the UI/UX experts, but here’s an idea that I think would work.\n\n- In the Photos app, when browsing around, still allow the zooming/panning just like it does today\n- When you Force Touch, have two options: 1) Create Watch Face 2) Add to Watch Face Album\n\nThen the Photo Album watch face should just select amount the photos that you’ve manually added in there.\n\nI’ve attached a few screenshots so you can see how much better some of my photos can look when they’ve been slightly tweaked. I compare with the Photo Album default presentation as well. \n\n- Ones with a _default.png suffix were screenshots from the Photo Album watch face\n- Ones with a _edited.png suffix were manually tweaked in the photos app and then Force Touch > Create Watch Face"
