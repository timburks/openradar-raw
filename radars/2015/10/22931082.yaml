    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of Mail it was possible to configure aliases for the same e-mail account by adding them as a comma separated list to the text field \"e-mail address\".\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade to 10.11 and Mail 9.0 e-mail aliases can now be configured using a popup menu.\r\nThe previously configured aliases are not migrated to the popup menu. Instead they are completely lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure e-mail aliases using a comma separated list in the \"Email Address\" text field in Mail on OS X 10.10 as explained here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19136?locale=en_US\r\n2. Upgrade to 10.11 (Mail 9.0)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAliases are migrated to new \"Alias\" pop-up menu explained here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22279?locale=en_US\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlias pop-up menu only contains the first e-mail address from the \"e-mail address\" text field on 10.10. The previously configured aliases are lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 (3094), OS X 10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm a heavy user of e-mail aliases. I use a different e-mail alias for nearly every service/company with a catch all account on my private domain. While it is certainly possible to reconfigure the lost aliases whenever responding to an e-mail from an alias that was lost, it is unnecessary work that could have been prevented by adding migration code from the comma separated list to the new pop-up.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMail Version 9.0 (3094), OS X 10.11 (15A284)\r\nIMAP Account\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
