    description: "related to 23093580\r\n\r\nhttps://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/apple_music_badges.html\r\n\r\nThe vertical centring of “MUSIC” seems to squash the “Listen on” prefix above it, giving it the appearance of being mis-aligned. In addition, this new button is inconsistent with the Available on the App Store badges.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#downloadOnAppstore"
