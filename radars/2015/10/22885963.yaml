    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen developing an app I often need to present things to others (pers & review groups). It would be enormously helpful top have a kind of visualization effect for touch events which could be optionally activated for presentation.\r\n\r\nThe \"Developer\"-menu in the Settings app seems to be perfectly suited for this feature. To get an example what i mean have a look at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mapbox/Fingertips/\r\n\r\nThis realizes animations to visualize touches in-app, but when presenting e.g. widgets this feature is not any longer available.\r\n\r\nOnly you guys at Apple could pull this off!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Try to present a new feature to peers & review groups.\r\n\r\n2) See how visualizing touches helps them follow your way through an app\r\n\r\n3) Recognize that this visualization is not available for developers right now\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect an option to visualize touch events explicitly via the Developer menu in the Settings app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such thing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iPhone or iPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
