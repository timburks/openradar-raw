    description: "Summary: If a paired Bluetooth audio device (e.g. a car audio system) is available but in a paused state, I am unable to play Music or Podcasts with the iPhone speaker as the audio output device. Sound plays for a fraction of a second through the speaker, then music immediately pauses itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Pair iPhone with Bluetooth car audio\r\n2. Turn the car audio \"off\" (i.e. announcing its presence but not accepting audio)\r\n3. While in range of Bluetooth, select iPhone as the audio output device\r\n4. In Music or Podcasts, press Play\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Audio should play through iPhone speaker\r\n\r\nActual Results: Audio plays for a split second, then immediately pauses itself. (\"iPhone\" remains selected as the audio output.)\r\n\r\nVersion: 9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes: Workaround is to turn off Bluetooth altogether\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n iOS 9.0.1 on iPhone 5S\r\nSubaru Forester 2014 audio system"
