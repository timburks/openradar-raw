    description: |-
        I’ve noticed this many times over the past few years, so I don’t think it’s anything new. My gripe is that there is often no font-size setting in iBooks that is neither too big nor too small. It’s not that I want the text to be at some specific size; I just want the increments between sizes to be finer so that I don’t end up with no options that seem acceptable.

        I’m attaching a representative page at two adjacent sizes. They look more clearly distinguished on the iPad screen than on a desktop. I’d call the one with the smaller font size readable, though perhaps a bit uncomfortably small with the backlight turned low. The next size up looks like a large-print edition for geriatrics. There’s simply nothing in between, at least with this font (Iowan).
