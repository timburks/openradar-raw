    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading a new build to iTunes Connect the processing step can take a long time. While the build is processing there is no indication of progress or how long it's going to take. It can take several minutes to days making it hard to detect when a build is legitimately still processing or just stuck.\r\n\r\nThe processing step makes it very hard to time beta releases because after uploading, it can take a variable amount of time before it's available to internal testers. External testers is worse because making it available is a manual step after the build has finished processing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload a build to iTC\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build to be available (near) instantly. Or to have an indication of how long it'll be before the build is available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe is remains “Processing…” for an seemingly arbitrary amount of time"
