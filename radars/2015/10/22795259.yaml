    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile triggering a 3D Touch preview on a registered view, if `unregisterForPreviewingWithContext:` is called on the context associated with the view that the preview was triggered from, the preview will be stuck on screen and cannot be dismissed by the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. call `registerForPreviewingWithDelegate:sourceView:` on a view.\r\n2. while triggering the Peek preview, call `unregisterForPreviewingWithContext:` with the context received from the call in Step 1.\r\n3. the Peek preview triggered earlier will remain on screen and cannot be dismissed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preview should be dismissed when `unregisterForPreviewingWithContext:` is called. Alternatively, there should be a way to inspect whether a context is being used for an ongoing Peek -- so developers can programmatically determine whether we should avoid calling unregister.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Peek preview is stuck forever with no way for the user to dismiss.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0"
