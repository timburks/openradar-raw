        Summary:
        CFNetwork Diagnostics logs lots of interesting information about CFNetwork read and write events. It only shows raw bytes written to the wire, which is virtually useless for TLS connections. Instead, CFNetwork Diagnostics should show bytes written before TLS encryption, and bytes read after TLS decryption.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run an app that uses network connections with the "CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS" environment variable set to “3”.

        Expected Results:
        The CFNetwork log file should contain plaintext wire traffic as well as encrypted wire traffic.

        Actual Results:
        The CFNetwork log only includes encrypted wire traffic.
