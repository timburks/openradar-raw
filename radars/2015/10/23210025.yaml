        Summary:
        Because bridging headers are not supported for framework targets, the only way to expose Objective-C headers to Swift is to make the headers public. This is a regression when compared to a pure Objective-C project, where you can choose to keep Objective-C headers internal.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new Swift framework target
        2. Create an Objective-C class
        3. Attempt to use this class from Swift: the only way to do so is to expose it in the umbrella header, and attempting to add a bridging header results in a compiler error.

        Expected Results:
        N/A

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        There is no such limitation in a pure Objective-C framework.
