    description: "Since iOS8 ABPeoplePickerNavigationController does not require us to ask the user's permission when picking a contact. However, when the selected contact has linked contacts it crashes.\r\n\r\nThis is a major bug. For us, users can select their own contact card to import user data during onboarding/signup. You can imagine the user's reaction when the app crashes during onboarding.\r\n\r\nWe have worked around it by applying the old method by asking permission, but that feels like a bad user experience."
