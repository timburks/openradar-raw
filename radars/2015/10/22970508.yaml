        When I use Safari in fullscreen playing a video, the cursor disappear. One of the reasons might be double screen setup.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch Safari
        2. Go to Fullscreen mode
        3. Go to a webpage with videos (I encounter this issue on khanacademy.org)
        4. Watch the video (I donâ€™t make it fullscreen)
        5. Play with the cursor (move from one screen to another)

        Expected Results:
        When I move the cursor to the screen which is in fullscreen the cursor should be visible

        Actual Results:
        The cursor is not displayed on screen until I click.
