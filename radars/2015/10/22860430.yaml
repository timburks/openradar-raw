    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 9, if a UIKeyCommand selector method is called on a viewController, that controller is retained and will not dealloc when dismissed causing memory leaks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement a project with two view controllers - one dynamically created / dismissed.\r\n2. Implement a keyCommands property on the 2nd view controller registering a key and a selector (with some NSLog trace) in the 2nd view controller.\r\n3. Make sure the 2nd view controller becomes first responder when it is shown. \r\n4. Implement dealloc in the 2nd view controller with NSLog trace\r\n5. Run the app\r\n6. Preset the second view controller.\r\n7. Press the registered key on the external keyboard and verify that the selector gets called.\r\n8. Dismiss the 2nd view controller.\r\nResults: the 2nd view controllers dealloc will not get called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected that handling UIKeyCommands in a view controller will not cause it to leak. i.e. keep dealloc from getting called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a UIKeyCommand selector is called in a view controller, that view controller will not dealloc when dismissed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A340)"
