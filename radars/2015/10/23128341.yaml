    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm creating a convenience init method to generate resizable images, however it is not possible to do this in Swift.\r\n\r\nFor example, if my init method looks like:\r\n\r\ninit(…) {\r\n  // …\r\n  self.init(CGImage: someImage)\r\n  //\r\n  return self.resizableImageWithCapInsets(…)\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis errors, because you cannot return non-nil. However, UIImage has no facility to adjust the cap insets in-place, because it's an immutable object.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to create a convenience init method to generate resizable images\r\n2. Fail because UIImage is not able to do so\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIImage as an init method which can set the cap insets so I don't have to create another instance for it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIImage can only return a resizable image based on another image, which does not mesh well with Swift\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
