    description: "If you're playing audio from an app (ex: Music, or a third-party app like Overcast) to your AppleTV using AirPlay and your device sleeps (or you lock it), the audio gets paused. This happens regardless of whether the app is in focus or in the background. It seems the only way to get the audio to continue playing is to press play from the lock screen (and then not lock/sleep the device from anywhere else other than the lock screen). I've only started seeing this behaviour since the iOS 9.1 update.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music.app\r\n2. Start playing some music over AirPlay\r\n3. Lock your phone with the side button.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nMusic continues to play\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nMusic is paused\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 128gb\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nedit: Now I'm seeing this occur with wired headphones as well \U0001F621"
