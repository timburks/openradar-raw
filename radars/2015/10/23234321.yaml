    description: "Summary:\r\nDefault python path and System Integrity Protection block successful package installs with projects like pip\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. install pip, e.g. with easy_install pip\r\n2. install any common python package with 'sudo pip', so it's available system-wide (django, aws-cli, etc.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuccessful installation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOSError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/tmp/pip-Tz8iWw-uninstall/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/six-1.4.1-py2.7.egg-info'\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n10.11+ computers with SIP enabled\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBecause six ships with the system, and almost every popular python project uses it for forwards compatibility, pip tries to upgrade the version it finds first in the python path. Since SIP blocks this, it fails.\r\nAny python dependencies system software has should be hard-coded, and the default path should look in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages first in order."
