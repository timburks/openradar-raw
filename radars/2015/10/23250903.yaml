        Summary:
        On two separate occasions now, I submitted new builds of my iOS app to iTunes Connect to use them for internal testing. I experienced a delay and went on to other things. When I noticed it had been a while and I didn’t get any notifications, I refreshed the Activity tab for the app in iTunes Connect, and it immediately sent me an email and push notification that the app was ready. Shouldn’t apps automatically be available for testing after submission?

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make new Archive build of iOS app in Xcode
        2. Submit build to iTunes Connect
        3. Go to the Activity tab in Safari for the app
        4. Verify that the app status is “Pending”

        Expected Results:
        At some point after step 4, I should get a notification from TestFlight that there’s a new build available for internal testing

        Actual Results:
        I don’t get notified about the new internal build until I refresh the page opened in step 3 (after an hour or so has gone by). The first time this happened, I thought it was a coincidence, but it happened again with the next build
