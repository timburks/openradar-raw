    description: "Summary:\nDesigning, arranging and adjusting objects in the \"Interface Builder\" is currently only possible at 100% zoom. Esp. with iPad pro and tvOS this is a time wrecking and cumbersome process.\n\nOther applications like Pages, Keynote, Numbers do support their editing and layout features at more than just the 100% zoom - and so should Xcode.\n\nSteps to Reproduce (example):\n1. open a storyboard for tvOS\n2. add a navigation view controller and two ore more navigation controllers\n3. zoom out to 50%\n3. add segues to create a typical navigation stack between the view controllers\n\nExpected Results:\nAt all zoom scales all editing features should work as they work at 100%.\n\nActual Results:\nXcode either zooms out to 100% zoom automatically and interrupts the segues creation or does not let the user create a segue. The solution involves heavy scrolling, missing targets and rearranging objects.\n\nRegression: \nAt the moment only the 27\" iMac can display a full tvOS view controller with the usual palettes. For multi-monitor or MacBook usage this is a pain significantly wasting time and efficiency while developing for these platforms.\n\nNotes:\nIt's important to note that more than just segue creation via drag&drop is affected by this limitation. Xcode should support editing in all supported zoom scales for (but not limited to):\n- segues drag&drop\n- view/scene drag&drop\n- alignment of views\n- resizing of objects\n- creating objects by means of drag&drop from the objects palette\n- selecting objects for inspection\n- editing of layout constraints for Auto Layout\n- display/editing of size classes"
