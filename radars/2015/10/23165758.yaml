    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I try to add a phone number and create a new contact via Phone.app, the app will crash once I enter a Thai letter in first name or last name field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Phone.app.\r\n2. Type in phone number.\r\n3. Tap \"+\" sign and select \"Create New Contact\".\r\n4. Enter a Thai alphabet (such as ‡∏Å) in the first name or last name field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhone would let me complete the name field and save the new contact\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhone.app crashes and back to Springboard.app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2 (13A452)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that I this problem does not occur on iPhone 5 (A1428) with iOS 9.0.2 (13A452). I do not have an iPhone 6 to reproduce the problem. However, it is occurring on an iPhone 6s Plus T-Mobile as well, so it must be something within the code in the new hardware.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s T-Mobile (A1688)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iPhone contact crash.mov' was successfully uploaded."
