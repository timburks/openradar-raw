        Summary:
        There is no way to provide custom launch screens for 3D touch UIApplicationShortcutItems. Users will see the wrong launch image when an application shortcut launches a screen that is different than the standard root view controller of the application launch.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an iOS application with multiple screens that look different.
        2. Create a launch storyboard that matches the root view controller, with no content, as dictated by the iOS HIG.
        3. Create a static UIApplicationShortcutItem in the Info.plist that launches a screen that looks visually different than the root view controller.
        4. Launch the application using your new UIApplicationShortcutItem.

        Expected Results:
        The user will see the view controller that would be the result of the UIApplicationShortcutItem, with no content, as would likely be dictated by the iOS HIG if they covered this topic.

        Actual Results:
        The user will see the launch storyboard for the root view controller before seeing a screen that is visually dissimilar to that screen.
