    description: "We make extensive use of custom url-scheme links to enable our users to open select urls in our app. For example:\r\n\r\nhttps://steller.co/explore --> steller://open-explore\r\n\r\nhttps://steller.co/s/52hPGTM7Gtx --> steller://open-story?id=635273508066166077\r\n\r\nhttps://steller.co/steller --> steller://open-profile?id=207339102087939892\r\n\r\netc\r\n\r\nThese links currently work fine when tapped within iOS Safari (stand-alone) but do not work within in-app browsers (specifically, Twitter, Pinterest, and Facebook's in-app browsers).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nprerequisite: install the steller app http://stlr.co/getsteller\r\n\r\n1. using the twitter app, visit the @StellerStories profile (https://twitter.com/StellerStories)\r\n2. tap any link which starts with https://steller.co/s to open that url within twitter's in-app browser\r\n3. look for the \"Open in Steller\" link in the bar along the bottom of the page (see attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nalternately, \r\n\r\n1. using the facebook app, visit the StellerStories page (https://www.facebook.com/Stellerstories/)\r\n2. tap any link which starts with https://steller.co/s to open that url within facebook's in-app browser\r\n3. look for the \"Open in Steller\" link in the bar along the bottom of the page (see attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsteller app launches, you are taken to the story you had been viewing within the in-app browser.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nin twitter and pinterest, the custom url-scheme link does nothing (appears non-functional). in facebook, we see an error page stating that \"Sorry, this isn't a valid link\" (see attached screenshot)"
