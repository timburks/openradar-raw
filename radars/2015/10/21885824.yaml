    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a camera (or device with camera, like an iPhone or iPad) is connected to a Mac, the system automatically launches an app to import photos from that device. If this isn't desired behavior, there's a preference to turn it off per device in Image Capture.\r\n\r\nPreviously, there was also a global setting to suppress this app launch in iPhoto. However, no equivalent setting exists in Photos; it's currently impossible to avoid automatically launching an app on connecting a new camera device. This is an ongoing annoyance when working with several devices (as in switching between several test devices), and a regression from iPhoto.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a new device to OS X with Photos installed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'm able to set a setting to suppress any app being launched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such setting, so Photos is automatically launched. (I usually then launch Image Capture to turn off that setting for this one device, but the cycle continues with the next new device.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 1.0.1 (215.65.0) / OS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Mac\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
