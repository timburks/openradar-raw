    description: "Summary:\n\nFor debug, beta, and release builds we use app icons of different colors\nalong with different bundle identifiers. This means a developer's device\ncan have multiple builds on it at once. When choosing which process to\nmonitor in Instruments, the colors of the app icons are not different,\nInstruments shows just one of the icons multiple times. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Install an app on your device\n2. Change the bundle identifier and app icon\n3. Install a second version on your device\n4. In Instruments go to attach to a process on the device\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe app icons icons should be the same as the icons shown on the\ndevice's homescreen.\n\nActual Results:\n\nA single icon is repeated making it difficult to determine which process\nto attach to.\n\nNotes:\n\n- See the attached screenshots for an example, one is instruments, the\n  other is the correct behavior shown in the Xcode devices window."
