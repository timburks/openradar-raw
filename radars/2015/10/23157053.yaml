    description: "Summary:\r\nA window that should have rounded corners is painted with square corners. The corner radius on the NSThemeFrame is never set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe problem can be demonstrated by running the attached sample program. It is a Java program that uses native code to set the NSFullSizeContentViewWindowMask. I do not have a non-Java test program that illustrates the problem.\r\n\r\n0. Ensure that Java JDK 1.8.0_45 is installed\r\n\r\n1. Run this command:\r\n\r\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java -jar TestFullContentView.jar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA small window with rounded corners should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlthough rounded corners are drawn, the window paints outside the bounds of the rounded corners making the corners look square. The setCornerRadius: method on CALayer is never called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.1 beta 15B38b and 10.10.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached test program reliably demonstrates the bug using JDK 1.8.0_45 on two systems, one running OS X 10.10.5 and one running OS X 10.11.1. This test program does not demonstrate the bug if I use JDK 1.8.0_60 on either system. However, I have seen the bug using a different program on JDK 1.8.0_60. This variability suggests that the problem may be timing dependent.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have observed this problem on OS X 10.11.0 and on multiple beta versions of OS X 10.11.1 and OS X 10.10.5.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
