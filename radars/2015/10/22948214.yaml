    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Project Navigator one can cmd-click a folder and chose \"Show in Finder\" then. Normally the file system folder connected to the folder should be opened in finder.\r\n\r\nWhen I do this the first time finder is opened, but the wrong folder is shown. \r\nWhen I do this the second time for the same folder, then the right folder is shown.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlready when executing \"Show in Finder\" the first time, the right folder should be shown opened in finder. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.x.x"
