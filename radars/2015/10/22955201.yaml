    description: "Summary:\r\nMy daughter got an iPod Touch, and I started iMessaging with her on OS X and iPhone. At some point I restarted Messages on my Mac, and it incorrectly combined my wife and my daughter into a single recipient. Messages intended for my wife went to my daughter!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find a iMessage recipient in Messages.\r\n2. Note the home phone for said recipient. Should not be used for iMessage or SMS.\r\n3. Create another Contact with the same home phone number.\r\n4. Start iMessaging with the new recipient in Messages, but not via that home phone.\r\n5. Restart Messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTwo recipients should be maintained as separate threads/tabs/panes/whatever in Messages. Messages can be sent or received with each recipient independently.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth recipients end up in a single thread/tab/pane/whatever. Messages can be received from both, but sent only to one (the one that appears first in Contacts, I think).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried removing the tab/pane/whatever with the combined recipients, but they were still combined when new messages were sent. The only way I found to detangle them was to remove the home phone number from my daughter's Contact info and restart messages."
