    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading screenshots using Transporter, we must specify, for each file, its size and md5 checksum in the xml. I understand why it’s needed for large/sensitive files (e.g. movies.). For App screenshots, it’s overkill; all it does is making Transporter harder to script. And anyway, we don’t have to do that when uploading screenshots into the web UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* use Transporter to fetch the metadata of an app;\r\n* simply replace the screenshots with new files;\r\n* upload;\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* profit!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Transporter could itself check which files were modified and provide a short summary or ask for confirmation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTransporter complains that the file size and checksum don’t match.\r\n\r\n(To be honest, from a user’s point of view, this is particularly frustrating. This is the scene that happened when I setup it the first time:\r\n_AARGH. I KNOW THE CHECKSUM DONT MATCH WHY DO YOU ASK ME TO FILL IT IF YOURE GONNA CHECK IT YOURSELF._)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a"
