        Summary:
        I love watchOS 2’s ClockKit Complications.  The more I use them, the more I wish I had the same on iOS’s lock screen, and maybe even somewhere on the home screen.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Look at my Watch’s clock face.  Smile.  Look at my iPhone’s lock screen and wish I had Complications.

        Expected Results:
        Same capabilities for Complications on both watchOS and iOS.  (I see less value/usability in the Time Travel stuff on iOS, and not sure how to implement it anyway.)

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A
