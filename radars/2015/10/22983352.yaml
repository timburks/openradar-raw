    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Disk Utility App in El Capitan is practically useless. It is less user friendly and less functional. It is a major step back from previous versions of Disk Utility in OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample:\r\n1. Attach a disk with an encrypted JHFS+ filesystem\r\n* Close the auto-prompt for password if asked\r\n2. Open Disk Utility and try to mount the encrypted volume\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect it to be easy to mount this volume. The \"unlock\" function should be in the toolbar by default when applicable. I expect there to be a right-click context menu to allow the appropriate actions when I right-click on a drive or volume.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application is pure useless. I might as well throw OS X UI away and do everything from the command line from the start.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-10-05 at 6.18.29 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
