    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen taking screen shots in the simulator, the actual dimensions of the screenshots are effected if a window scale is set. This will waste an incredible amount of a lot of people's time as using the simulator to generate screen shots for different devices is commonplace and you don't realize the shots are the wrong size well into production of assets. This has never been an issue before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run any project with the provided simulator in Version 7.1 beta 3 (7B85). \r\n2. In the \"File\" menu choose \"Save Screen Shot\".\r\n3. In the \"Window\" menu choose \"Scale\" and pick a different scale.\r\n4. In the \"File\" menu choose \"Save Screen Shot\".\r\n5. Compare the screen shots pixel dimensions and become sad, so sad that you fix this before beta 4\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe screen shots should always be the same size regardless of screen scale. Screen scale only exists to allow the simulator to be visible on smaller screens.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screen shots sizes vary with the sale.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode Version 7.1 beta 3 (7B85)\r\nOSX 10.11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXCode Version 7.1 beta 3 (7B85)\r\nIOS 9 simulator iPhone6"
