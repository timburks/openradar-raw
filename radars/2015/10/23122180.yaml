    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, Xcode betas are distributed in a DMG, with the name \"Xcode-beta.app\". Given that it's common to have multiple versions of Xcode installed simultaneously, I (and every developer I know) immediately rename the app bundle as soon as they've copied it out of the DMG.\r\n\r\nTo avoid every single 3rd party developer from having to do this themselves every time they install an Xcode beta, please consider naming the app bundles with the version name, e.g.:\r\n\r\nXcode 7.1 Beta 3.app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
