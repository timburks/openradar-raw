    description: "Summary:\r\nAs a user, troubleshooting a misbehaving built-in app on iOS is frustrating. Sometimes things go wrong in a way the the app or OS just isn't able to deal with. While that's often a sign of a bug that needs to be fixed, as a user I just want a way to get my device working again.\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS X we can do things like manually deleting preferences, caches, databases, and so on—most users won't know how to do those things but they can at least follow instructions from advanced users who have run into the same problems.\r\n\r\nWith third-party iOS apps we have a great option: deleting and reinstalling the app. This is wonderful.\r\n\r\nWith built-in iOS apps we have very little short of restoring the entire device. A couple of years ago that was a time consuming but mostly hands-off process. Now it's a lot more work: I have to un-pair my Watch, back up, wipe the device, restore from the backup, add all my finger prints again, re-pair my Watch, add my Apple Pay cards back to both devices, authorize iCloud Keychain, and… wait, did I forget anything? If I restored from iCloud I also need to re-type a bunch of passwords that aren't stored in iCloud keychain for some reason, like all my email passwords. I also have to cross my fingers that this actually fixes the problem and that nothing new goes wrong in the process.\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if I could just tap Settings, tap General, tap Reset, and then tap something like \"Reset Music and iTunes Store\".\r\n\r\n(This request was inspired by my new iPhone 6s asking for my iTunes password every time I rebooted it. There were 29 songs it was trying and failing to download every time. After putting up with this for 3 weeks, I tried many, many things to try to clear out whatever was causing this. Eventually I gave up and restored the phone. It fixed the problem, but I really wish there was an easier way to reset the Music app and/or iTunes Store. This is definitely not the first time I've run into a weird issue like this.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
