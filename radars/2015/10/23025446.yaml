    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 9.0, when an NSDate is used in a predicate for an NSFetchRequest executed in a child context, the date is retained one too many times and it leaks.\r\n\r\nThis does not occur on iOS 8.3 or below.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/followben/DateLeaks\r\n2. Build/Run or Profile the app using the Leaks instrument on iOS 8.3\r\n3. Build/Run or Profile the app using the Leaks instrument on iOS 9.0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn both iOS 9 and iOS 8, NSLog indicates a retainCount of 1 and the Leaks Instrument detects no leaks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 8, NSLog indicates a retainCount of 1 and the Leaks Instrument detects no leaks.\r\n\r\nHowever, on iOS 9, NSLog indicates a retainCount of 2 and the Leaks Instrument indicates a leak.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2 (13A452), Xcode 7.0 (7A218)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the fetch request is executed on the parent context the date does not leak. The ConcurrencyType of the child context does not seem to impact this behaviour.\r\n\r\nI've also tested this with numerous other types (NSString, NSNumber) and this only seems to occur with NSDate.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator, iPhone 5, iPhone 6"
