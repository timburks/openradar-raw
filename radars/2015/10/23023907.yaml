    description: |-
        Similar to how Apple intercepts and parses incoming authentication text messages to make it easier for users to validate 2-factor auth with Apple software on iOS, it should be possible for developers to register their own source phone numbers for text messages, such that if an iOS device receives such a message from the registered number, perhaps fitting a specified format, the text of the message (or perhaps just a numerical code that matches a specific format) will be passed into the developerâ€™s app delegate for handling.

        This would allow third party developers on iOS to quickly bring new users onboard, or authenticate existing users, without requiring them to hand-type incoming authentication codes.
