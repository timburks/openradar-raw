    description: "Traditionally, task_for_pid() along with task_info() and mach_vm_region() have been used to get basic information for a process. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled, that no longer works.\r\n\r\nAn example of how this type of information is collected is shown here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/chockenberry/iPulse/blob/master/AGProcess.m\r\n\r\nI’d like to see a mechanism to retrieve basic information about a process that avoids task_for_pid (and the corresponding danger of code injection, etc.)\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be a way to get a list of all processes and then a way to collect basic statistics for each one. The information that would be helpful is:\r\n\r\n• Process name and id\r\n• CPU usage (as a percentage)\r\n• CPU time (both user and system)\r\n• Memory usage (as a percentage)\r\n• Memory size (both virtual and resident)\r\n• Task events (fault counts, pages in/out)\r\n\r\nThe information could then be presented in a way that allows the user to keep an eye on what their Mac is doing at a glance (in the Dock, menubar or small window.) Activity Monitor can show this information, but not in a compact way that’s always visible."
