    description: "Summary:\r\nItems in the device and simulator picker menu in Xcode have ugly blue rectangles behind them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an iOS project in Xcode.\r\n2. Click the device and simulator picker (not sure what the official name is).\r\n3. Mouse over the items in the menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHighlighted items look just like highlighted items in other menus that have pictures next to the text, for example schemes in the scheme chooser menu or recent items under the Apple menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHighlighted items have weird blue boxes behind them. It’s as though the image and text label have solid color instead of transparent background.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI believe this was introduced in Xcode 6, although I didn’t get around to filing it until now.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshots, also posted at http://cl.ly/dPpx"
