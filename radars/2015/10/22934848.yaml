    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen viewing some larger property trees in the Info.plist browser for an iOS or OS X project, upon expanding the branches, the view does not push down correctly and will result in the content overlapping the Document Types or other group in the UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Xcode\r\n2. Add some Info.plist properties that require more space (i.e. UIApplicationShortcutItems)\r\n3. Work on other things\r\n4. Come back to the Info.plist editor\r\n5. Expand properties to edit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Custom iOS Target Properties editor expands correctly, but it used to push the content below to fit everything in the view. The same behavior should be expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Info.plist content when expanded overlaps the content below causing some confusion as to what is currently being edited. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0.1 (7A1001)\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A279b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue doesn't seem to happen when the Info.plist does not contain a lot of content.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" (MacBookPro11,3) 16GB RAM, OS X 10.11\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 10.02.34 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
