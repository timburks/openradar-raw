    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen invoking the keyboard on UITextFields, text input works correctly until you tap on a second UITextField, wherein the text input in the first textfield will exhibit a momentary animated jump out of position and then back in. This seems to only happen on first instantiation of the view hierarchy, repeated use of the same textfield then behaves correctly. This bug is only apparent in ios9 using Autolayout when a keyboard is invoked. It is apparerent _whether or not_ the textfields are moved in response to the keyboard appearing.\r\n\r\nThere is an accompanying Autolayout warning that only occurs with the same setup (ios9 + autolayout). This may be related. See notes in the attached app.\r\n\r\nAttachment: TextFieldTest.zip\r\nSample app reproducing the issue + sample movies of the expected and rogue results. See also notes in the test app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn attached sample app.\r\n1. launch app\r\n2. touch first textField to start entering text\r\n3. enter text\r\n4. touch second textField to start entering text\r\n- bug is manifest if text in first textField jumps out of place briefly\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ntext should not jump out of place.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ntext momentarily animates out of place.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nios 9.0.2, simulator 9.0. Not evident on simulator 8.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached project + movie files\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niphone 5s and also on simulator 9.0. Not evident on simulator 8.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TextFieldTest.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nGithub:\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/foundry/UITextFieldBug/\">UITextFieldBug</a>"
