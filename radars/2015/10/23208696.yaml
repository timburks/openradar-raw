        Summary:

        Xcode beta versions come with proper release notes about changes and also with known issues. Unfortunately, once the stable version is released, the links to those donâ€™t work anymore and there are also no release notes for the final version itself. This makes it difficult to track known issues and makes it necessary to mirror the beta release notes.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Go to developer.apple.com/xcode/download

        Expected Results:

        Release notes for stable versions of Xcode

        Actual Results:

        *crickets*
