    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing mobile safari on iOS9 on a site which utilizes client-side navigation (via history.pushState), when you trigger the preview overlay using the force-touch \"peek\" gesture, client-side navigation is bypassed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. visit https://steller.co\r\n2. \"peek\" any of the story covers shown in the feed grid\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npreview is loaded using client-side navigation, client's in-memory state  is retained.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npreview is loaded from the server, bypassing client-side navigation. client's in-memory state is lost.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nin this specific scenario, we often pre-load data to make opening certain links (e.g. link to full story) load much faster. making use of the \"peek\" preview feature essentially defeats this optimization and slows down page loading."
