        Summary:

        I am a core team member of CocoaPods, which is distributed as a RubyGem. We are hearing some reports of our users that they’re unable to install any gems with binstubs successfully on OS X 10.11

        $ sudo gem install cocoapods
        Fetching: cocoapods-0.38.2.gem (100%)
        ERROR: While executing gem ... (Errno::EPERM)
        Operation not permitted - /usr/bin/pod

        This seems to be caused by /Library/Ruby/Site/2.0.0/rubygems/defaults.rb existing on the affected systems. This doesn’t seem to exist on all systems, though, e.g. I am running OS X 10.11 and don’t have it.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Unknown

        Expected Results:

        The system RubyGems should install their binstubs into /usr/local/bin

        Actual Results:

        The system RubyGems install their binstubs into /usr/bin — which is protected by System Integrity Protection and therefore fails

        Regression:

        This problem did not exist on earlier versions of OS X because SIP didn’t exist.
