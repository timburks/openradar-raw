    description: "Summary:\nThe dates in the Hebrew calendar for 5806 and 5807 in Mac OS are off by a day. The calendar is reporting an extra day added to Heshvan in 5806, but that extra day is not added until 5807. All the dates between 29 Heshvan 5806 and 1 Kislev 5807 are off by a day. One easy-to-observe consequence of this is that the system is reporting Rosh Hashanah 5807 as being on 2 October 2046, when multiple sources confirm that it is on 1 October 2046.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a date for 5807-01-01 on the Hebrew Calendar\n2. Convert that date into the Gregorian calendar\n\nExpected Results:\nIt should report the Gregorian date as 2046-10-01\n\nActual Results:\nIt reports the Gregorian date as 2047-10-02\n\nRegression:\n\nNotes:\n\nYou can compare the dates for these years to these calendars:\n\nCalendar 1: https://www.hebcal.com/hebcal/?year=2046&v=1&maj=on&min=on&nx=on&mf=on&ss=on&mod=on&c=off&month=x#cal-2046-10 \nCalendar 2: http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/month.asp?tdate=10/1/2046"
