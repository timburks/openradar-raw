    description: "If a user has time limits set those time limits reset per machine that user logs into.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a Local Network User with time limits as a profile\r\n2. Have that user login to a OD bound computer\r\n3. Let the user run their time down to almost nothing\r\n4. Have the user logout of the computer\r\n5. Have the user log in to a different OD bound computer\r\n6. Time limits start over\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the time limits to be honored across all bound computers.  If the User has a 30 minute time limit and logs into computer A for 15 minutes I would expect they would only have 15 minutes left when they log into computer B\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTime limits seem to reset and start from scratch per computer the user logs into\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.11.1 Using Server.app 5.0.15"
