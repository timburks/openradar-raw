        Summary:
        On iOS 9, I simply create a brand new single-view application and target it for iPad. On the Main Storyboard I add a text field and run the application. When I tap on the text field for the first time, the following error messages appear on the console:

        “<CATransformLayer: 0x7fc26c8372d0> - changing property masksToBounds in transform-only layer, will have no effect
        2015-10-16 11:31:11.842 KeyboardFail[2535:150283] <CATransformLayer: 0x7fc26c839ff0> - changing property masksToBounds in transform-only layer, will have no effect
        2015-10-16 11:31:11.842 KeyboardFail[2535:150283] <CATransformLayer: 0x7fc26af03230> - changing property masksToBounds in transform-only layer, will have no effect”

        This is a plain, vanilla text field running off a template iOS app on an iPad with iOS 9, no custom controls or any code added at all.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Create a single-view application in Xcode 7 that targets the iPad and iOS 9.0
        2) Add a text field to the Main.storyboard file
        3) Run the application on an iPad with iOS 9.0 installed
        4) Tap the text field
        5) Notice the console message

        Expected Results:
        No errors, warnings or messages should appear in the console related to the maskToBounds property on any layers.

        Actual Results:
        The following is logged to the console upon tapping the text field:

        “<CATransformLayer: 0x7fc26c8372d0> - changing property masksToBounds in transform-only layer, will have no effect
        2015-10-16 11:31:11.842 KeyboardFail[2535:150283] <CATransformLayer: 0x7fc26c839ff0> - changing property masksToBounds in transform-only layer, will have no effect
        2015-10-16 11:31:11.842 KeyboardFail[2535:150283] <CATransformLayer: 0x7fc26af03230> - changing property masksToBounds in transform-only layer, will have no effect”

        Regression:
        This is possibly a regression as iOS 8 does not show this behavior.

        Notes:
        Attached is the sample Xcode project that can be run to reproduce the bug.
