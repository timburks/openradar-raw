    description: "Summary:\r\nScripts that use GUI Scripting to automate selection of menu items hosted by SystemUIServer run dramatically slower on 10.11 than on 10.10. This seems to be rooted in an artificial delay experienced after \"clicking\" the status item to reveal its content. Although the clicked item's menu appears instantly, control is not given back to the script for several seconds.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from 10.10 where the click is handled immediately and control given back to the script for further automation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure the Text Input menu extra is enabled from Keyboard System Preferences -> Input Sources\r\n2. Open attached SlowClickTest.scpt in Script Editor\r\n3. Run the script.\r\n4. Ensure GUI Scripting is allowed for Script Editor if necessary.\r\n5. Run the script again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script should run and in very short time click the Text Input menu and then click the \"U.S.\" item.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter clicking the text input menu to display the menu, there is a long delay of 5 seconds or more. Finally, control is given back to the script and the last click is able to proceed.\r\n\r\nRun the same script on 10.10 to see it work instantly.\r\n\r\nNote the delay is not tied to the Text Input menu in particular but there seems to be a delay in any clicking of any SystemUIServer hosted menu extra item.\r\n\r\nThe same delay is not imposed on clicks of other menu items, e.g. this simple script to quickly click the Apple menu and then select About This Mac:\r\n\r\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell the front menu bar of process \"Finder\"\r\n\ttell menu bar item 1\r\n\t\tclick\r\n\t\ttell menu item \"About This Mac\" of front menu\r\n\t\t\tclick\r\n\t\tend tell\r\n\tend tell\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SlowClickTest.scpt' was successfully uploaded."
