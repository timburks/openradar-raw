    description: "SVG is becoming more widely used throughout OS X. For example, itâ€™s used as the format for the new icons on pinned tabs in Safari.\r\n\r\nThese graphics can be viewed in Safari, but that makes it hard to see when there is transparency (which is important when the graphic is used as a mask as in the example above.) Using QuickLook to preview the graphic also defaults to a white background.\r\n\r\nIf you drop a SVG file on the Preview icon in the Dock, nothing happens. It would be great if the file was opened and displayed like a PNG or any other common web graphic that supports transparency."
