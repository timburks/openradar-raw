    description: "Summary:\r\nThe slider knob disappears in the progress bar after the first item has been played to the end. The user has no chance to interact with the slider anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBasically it's alloc/init an AVQueuePlayer with an array of AVPlayerItems. While playing the first item in the queue the UI works as expected. After switching to the next item in the queue the knob on the slider disappears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user can interact with the slider as usual dragging the knob of the slider to any point on the progress line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe knob of the slider disappears - the user has no chance to drag and switch in playing time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nin iOS8 everything works fine. It looks like the problem does not occur when the video was not pre-buffered before playing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll Phones & Pads"
