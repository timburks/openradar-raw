    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen space is limited, a UINavigationBar will truncate the current back button. In English it tries the text ‘Back’ before removing the label entirely.\r\n\r\nWhen bar button items are subsequently removed or the title becomes shorter, the back button is not extended again to its full length unless the bar’s layout is updated (by its frame changing).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project\r\n2. Run the iOS app in the project\r\n3. Follow the instructions in the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe back button should be restored to full length when sufficient space is available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter being truncated, the back button stays truncated as the bar contents are updated. Sometimes the back button title changes to ‘Back’ and then that text is truncated, which looks awful.\r\n\r\nThe UI is inconsistent: if you rotate then rotate back it looks different from how it started.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143) Xcode 7.1 (7B91b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther than tapping the button to force a layout update, you can also restore a correct layout by rotating the device or taping the back button.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S device and iPhone 6 Plus simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Navigation bar back button truncation.zip' was successfully uploaded."
