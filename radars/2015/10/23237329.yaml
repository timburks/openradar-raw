    description: 'Upon "Enter Time Machine", it attempts to open and then crashes *every* *time*. Tested after first reading about this here: http://macperformanceguide.com/topics/topic-AppleCoreRot.html . Issue appears to be tied to dual-monitor usage, according to various comments around the web. I can confirm I am using a dual-monitor set-up with Mac Mini (two Samsung 24" displays).'
