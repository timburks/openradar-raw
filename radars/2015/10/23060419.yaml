    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the storyboard in a tvOS project is zoomed to 50%, UIControls can not be dragged onto the View from the Object Library. This is problematic as the FullHD resolution of the storyboard at 100% is often larger than the screen resolution of the Mac running Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Zoom storyboard to 50% by right-clicking outside of the ViewController and selecting the appropriate zoom level.\r\n2. Select a UIControl from the Object Library and drag it onto the View.\r\n3. Release the mouse button to drop the UIControl onto the View.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIControl should be added to the View.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIControl disappears with no trace."
