        Summary:
        The new security-related changes to El Capitan have resulted in Ruby's "gem install" command breaking in horrible ways.  There are two main issues:

        1. The RubyGems installation directory is now set to "/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0" which is not writable by the user.  Thus, "gem install" requires sudo, which is shouldn't.

        2. The executables are not installed in a location in the user's $PATH, meaning the user either has to update their path or install manually into a directory that is in their path.

        In a nutshell, we've gone from this:

        $ gem install jekyll

        to this:

        $ sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Attempt to install a Ruby gem in 10.11 with a command similar to the following:

        gem install jekyll

        Expected Results:
        The gem is installed.

        Actual Results:
        The following error is thrown:

        ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
            You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.

        Adding sudo allows the gem to install, but it is still not usable because it is installed in a location that is not in the user's $PATH.
