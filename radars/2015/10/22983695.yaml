    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"System Integrity Protection enabled\" item in the Disk utility.app Get Info window dialog is confusing. For example, it will say \"System Integrity Protection enabled\" is set to \"Yes\" when SIP is disabled. This does not make sense. This is too ambiguous.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Disk Utility.app\r\n2. Open the Info window of a drive\r\n3. Look at the System Integrity Protection enabled field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect this to reflect the actual state of SIP. OR I expect a second field to clarify the actual state of SIP and this field to indicate whether the drive supports SIP or not. However, given SIP is a kernel-level implementation, I do not know how a disk could not be SIP enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSystem Integrity Protection enabled is always set to \"Yes\" even if SIP is actually disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-10-05 at 6.48.08 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
