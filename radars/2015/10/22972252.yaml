Open the attached email digest (uppervalley-digest.eml) in Mail\r\n2. Click the link to the tenth message in the digest, with the subject \"ISO Chimney Sweep\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"ISO Chimney Sweep\" message scrolls into view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI see this behavior on OS X 10.11 (15A284).
