    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I get an email on my iPhone with multiple phone numbers for a volunteer transportation mission (some people still do this), I cannot create new contacts\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive an email containing multiple phone numbers that are not in your contacts - the one I used had them in the format (123) 456-7890\r\n2. Long-press on the first one and choose to create a contact.  Fill out and save that form.\r\n3. Long-press on the second one and choose to create a contact.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJust like the first number, the form would be pre-populated with the second phone number.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe form is pre-populated with the first phone number.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4.1 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is on iOS - it's not clear whether this should be filed under Mail or iOS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTried only on iOS 8.4.latest and iPhone 6.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
