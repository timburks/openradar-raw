    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://23012686\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe huge screen of a TV is the number one reason you want to display content on this screen, that is rather awkward to watch on smaller screens.\r\n\r\nMaps and geographic information like weather, environmental data, routes, places are perfect examples of content that works much better on a bigger screen.\r\n\r\nI want to offer such content. I need MapKit for this to happen OR I will try to go with some other open source solution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere is no MapKit on tvOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is MapKit on tvOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no MapKit on tvOS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.0 (13T5365h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\ntvOS latest developer release and device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
