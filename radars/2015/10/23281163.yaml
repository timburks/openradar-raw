    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UISegmentedControl and setting it up with UIImages as contents for each segment... this thing becomes inaccessible by users which rely on VoiceOver support.\r\n\r\nEven attaching accessibilityLabel to the UIImage does not change this. VoiceOver ignores this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to find out which segment of a UISegmentedControl – which is setup with images – is actually selected using VoiceOver. You will ony hear the segment index, no further accessibility info.\r\n\r\nThat is beacuse you cannot provide accessibility info for UISegmentedControls.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can apply accessibilityLabel & accessibilityHint to each segment or at least to the UIImges used and they will be respected by VoiceOver.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThat is impossible, therefore segments carrying image content are inaccessible by users rellying on VoiceOver.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nany iOS qualifies, i.e. iOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany device running iOS will qualify\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UISegmentedControl.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
