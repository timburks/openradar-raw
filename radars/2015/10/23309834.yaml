    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempting to write a parser to make use of this file is impossible. It's an archive of a private class. This should be documented so that 3rd parties can build tools to parse these for consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is unreasonable to expect every iOS developer to use Xcode Server as their continuous integration system. We need tools that can adapt to more situations than currently available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen .xccoverage file. See it was saved with NSKeyedArchiver\r\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the .xccoverage file to be documented\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not documented\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1 & OS X 10.10.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll the time\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
