    description: "Summary:\r\nInt16, Int32, Int64 should all be convertible to AnyObject as NSNumbers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInt(0) as AnyObject    // => 0\r\nInt16(0) as? AnyObject // => nil\r\nInt32(0) as? AnyObject // => nil\r\nInt64(0) as? AnyObject // => nil\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInt16, Int32 and Int64 values should all be convertible to AnyObject as NSNumbers, just like Int values are.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInt16, Int32 and Int64 values are not convertible to AnyObject.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
