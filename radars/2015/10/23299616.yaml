    description: "Summary:\r\nPrior to the new Apple TV launch, I sent a promo code for my tvOS-only app, King Me! to a friend who redeemed it in the App Store app on an iPad. My tvOS-only app installed on the iPad with a blank icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Redeem a tvOS-only app promo code in the App Store app for iOS\r\n2. App downloads and installs on the iOS device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the tvOS app would either not allow redemption in the iOS App Store app or that it would show up as redeemed and be available on the new Apple TV when it ships.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the tvOS-only app installed on an iPad with no icon, presumably because the icon size for tvOS is not supported on iPad."
