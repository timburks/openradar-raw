    description: "Summary:\n\nSince upgrading to OS X 10.11.1 and therefore to Safari 9.0.1, I am experiencing massively degraded performance when a lot of tabs are open. Since my current set of tabs comes from before the upgrade, I am certain that the same amount worked just fine in 9.0 â€” I am unsure what kind of logs / information to send to enable you to debug this, though.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nHave a lot of tabs open in Safari\n\nExpected Results:\n\nSimilar performance as Safari 9.0\n\nActual Results:\n\nPerformance got massively worse. Safari freezes, new tabs are not loading or only partially loading. Quitting and restarting Safari leads to ~1h of full CPU utilisation while reloading all tabs (previously, it was a few minutes) and in the end, not all tabs are properly loaded anyway.\n\nRegression:\n\nI did not see any of this with Safari 9.0 on OS X 10.11.0 or during the El Capitan betas.\n\nNotes: \n\nPlease let me know what additional information I can supply to enable you to debug this."
