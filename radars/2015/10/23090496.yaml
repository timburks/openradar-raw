    description: "Summary:\r\nCalls from unidentified callers, often displayed as \"Unknown\" or \"No Caller ID\" can't be blocked and can be very intrusive.\r\n\r\nAn option to block these should be available for all users without the need to contact the carrier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I'm sleeping.\r\n2. I get 20 calls from an unidentified son of a...\r\n3. I try to block him.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. I can block him and others like him by selecting an option on settings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. I need to turn off my phone, leaving other important calls unattended.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a privacy issue, which you are, I know, very concerned with. I can't image why this isn't part of the OS yet.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
