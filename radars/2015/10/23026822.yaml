    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempts to boot mac whilst having two DELL U2414H monitors connected results in kernel panic half way through boot repeatedly. Unplugging displays until mac has booted resolves the issue\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect two DELL U2414H displays. One in each DisplayPort on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\r\n2. Attempt to power up mac\r\n3. Observe Apple Logo with loading indicator\r\n4. See Kernel panic and reboot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMac should boot\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKernel panic is displayed and mac restarts.\r\nThe only way to resolve is by unplugging both displays and waiting until the mac has booted to re-attatch.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDoes not occur when no displays are connected\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI found a discussion on the same issue here. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6988690?start=30&tstart=0"
