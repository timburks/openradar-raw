    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the current SDK (9.1 beta), there’s no way of animating the blur radius of a view. This feature appears to be used extensively throughout iOS internally, for example by the new tap, peek, pop API’s. In order to enhance the end-user experience, it would be nice if developers had access to such API as well, such that we can provide a more complete and vivid experience integrating better with the OS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be nice if `_UICustomBlurEffect` became a public class."
