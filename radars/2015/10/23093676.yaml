        Summary:
        On 10.11.1 (and possibly prior versions), you can delete /usr/local but not create it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Be on OS X 10.11.1 (or possible 10.11.0)
        2. In terminal, run 'sudo rm -rf /usr/local'
        3. In terminal, run 'sudo mkdir /usr/local'

        This applies to other SIP locations as well, such as /usr/libexec/cups:

        sudo rm -rf /usr/libexec/cups
        mkdir /usr/libexec/cups
        mkdir: /usr/libexec/cups: Operation not permitted

        Expected Results:
        You should either be prevented from deleting the whole /usr/local directory or you should be able to create it. This seems to apply to any SIP location that is whitelisted with a * in /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf

        Actual Results:
        After /usr/local is deleted, you get the following message:
        mkdir: /usr/local: Operation not permitted

        Regression:
        This happens on 10.11.1 15B17c for sure, could happen on previous various of 10.11 as this is a SIP issue.
