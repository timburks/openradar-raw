    description: "Summary:\nWhen playing an Audiobook through iBooks on iOS, and iBook is not the active application, the playback position will be lost when pausing or stopping playback and not returning to iBooks app \n\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Start playing audiobook in iBooks.  (Audiobook used does not have copy protection)\n- Change to other application or lock screen.\n- Continue playing for 10 min to 50 min.\n- Stop/Pause playback.\n- do not return straight away to iBooks app, instead use other apps (which probably cause iBooks to be closed to save memory)\n- Re-open iBooks to listen to audiobook again.\n- Curse at having to find you playback position because it was not updated when you stopped playing last. \n\n\nExpected Results:\n- Audiobook should start from last played position\n\n\nActual Results:\n- Sometimes audiobook does not start from last played position, but position before last played."
