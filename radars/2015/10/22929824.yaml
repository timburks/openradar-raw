    description: "Summary:\nI changed the password on one of my web accounts. I used the password suggested by Safari and it did not replace the old password. Therefore I am stuck without knowing what’s my password.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOccurs on Gmail (probably the system breaks because there aren’t two text fields on the screen): \n1. Create an account with your own password. \n2. Make Safari/Keychain remember it\n3. Change password (I did it through „forgotten password” flow)\n4. Use password suggested by Keychain/Safari\n5. Save it\n\nExpected Results:\nThe new password can be seen in Keychain and it can be used to login to gmail.\n\nActual Results:\nThe new password vanished. I’m stuck with a password I don’t know and the old password in the keychain\n\nConfiguration:\nOS X 10.11 (15A284), Safari 9.0 (11601.1.56), Keychain 9.0 (55171)"
