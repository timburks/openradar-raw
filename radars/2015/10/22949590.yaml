        Do the following in Terminal:

        ulimac:~ uli$ swift
        Welcome to Apple Swift version 2.0 (700.0.59 700.0.72). Type :help for assistance.
          1> var result : UInt8 = 255;
        result: UInt8 = 255
          2> result += 2
        Execution interrupted. Enter Swift code to recover and continue.
        Enter LLDB commands to investigate (type :help for assistance.)

        That second-to-last line indicates the program crashed. I fully support making overflows a hard error instead of just letting them happen in a programming language, but I would have expected it to terminate more gracefully, e.g. with an "integer overflow exception" or something like that. At the least there should be an error message, not just an interruption.

        NB - This also crashes in regular compiled Swift code, not just in the REPL.
