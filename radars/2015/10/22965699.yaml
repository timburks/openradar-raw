        Summary:
        Safari View Controller is unable to load custom content, such as CSS or JS, into loaded pages, even when they’re loaded from local HTML files. An app I support (Pushpin for Pinboard) relies on this functionality to nicely display downloaded bookmarks offline (i.e., so we can inject that page’s downloaded CSS, fonts, and/or JS to display everything as it would appear while connected to the Internet). However, since SVC does not support this, we have to continue using a custom UIWebView to display offline bookmarks.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a webpage using SVC.
        2. Have a desire to load custom content.

        Expected Results:
        Developers should be able to use a public API to load custom content.

        Actual Results:
        No API is available.
