    description: "Summary:\r\nI develop In-House (enterprise) applications. My internet connection is not reliable and the internet drops frequently. When the internet connection drops (but the device is still connected in wifi to the router) and then I try to launch one of my developed app, it craches because it can't launch in time.\r\nEverything works well when the internet connection is available but when it drops nothings works. I tried with an empty project created with Xcode (so without the need to have an internet connection) and it does not work too. It happens in debug and release mode.\r\n\r\nAfter many retries the app launches but I don't why.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create and install an In-House application (debug or release mode)\r\n2. Check the device is connected to a wifi router without internet (for example an airport)\r\n3. Restart the device (this is important because when the app was launched previously it works)\r\n4. Open the application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should be launched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application craches after 20s.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2 (13A452)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem also happens with iOS 8.x and with iOS 9.x.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini, iPad Air"
