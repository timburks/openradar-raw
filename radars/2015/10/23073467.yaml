    description: "Xcode Bots should not re-clone the entire repo (with all history) when set to clean. This causes our integrations to take up to 15-20 minutes to complete where most of the time is spent re-downloading the repo over and over.\r\n\r\nWith git there isn't really a point in having clean delete the repo anyway, but assuming that behavior is kept the clone should do a shallow clone of only the branch being integrated. This would tremendously speed up the integrations.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Setup an Xcode bot to point to a remote repo (eg: Github)\r\n2. Set the bot to Clean Always (which is ideal from a testing perspective)\r\n3. Watch as the bot takes *forever* to download the entire repo's history on every single integration\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe *smart* thing to do would be to cache the git repo and do a fetch, then check out a disconnected head of the branch being integrated into a separate build location. That way you could ensure a pristine copy of the source without re-downloading.\r\n\r\nFailing that, just do a shallow clone. It is the ultimate waste of bandwidth to repeatedly download and delete the entire history of the repo for every single bot."
