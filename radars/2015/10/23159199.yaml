    description: "Summary:\r\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\r\n30 minutes is, at best, a *minimum* exercise goal. Even 45 or 60 minutes of daily exercise goals would be reasonable for average Apple Watch owners. Conversely, a watch owner with limited mobility may find 20 or 15 minutes of exercise an achievable goal, and would only be discouraged by never registering a full Exercise ring. There is no “one size fits all” answer for exercise. Exercise goals should be customizable, similar to daily move goals. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\r\n1. In the Activity app, firmly press the Exercise screen to change your daily Exercise goal\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\r\nExpected Exercise goal could be customized, since Move goals can be customized.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExplain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.\r\nI was actually very surprised to discover after searching there is in fact no way to adjust Exercise goal! I could rationalize the fixed Stand goal, but Exercise seems a lot more like Move goals: different for different people. Why thirty minutes?\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.\r\nAs a distance runner, I’d set my daily Exercise goal between 45 and 60 minutes. The current 30 minute default is comically short. I basically ignore it, since even on “rest” days I achieve the Exercise goal by walking around and not even working out."
