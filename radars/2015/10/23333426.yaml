    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Xcode 7.1 simulator has been pinwheeling fairly regularly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run any app, including several of my own and the built-in apps like Safari.\r\n2. Try to do anything - keyboard input, scrolling, panning maps, tapping buttons, navigating in a UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp responds normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSimulator freezes up for a few seconds, then the pinwheel of doom appears. It sticks around for a little while (maybe 15 or 20 seconds), then the app is OK for a few seconds, then it locks up and pinwheels again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDidn’t happen in Xcode 7.0.1. Heard from others who have had the same issue. It happens reproducibly on my machine, but some people on my team running 7.1 haven’t seen it at all.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTried blowing away and re-creating simulators. I’ve tried to figure out which process is hanging in Activity Monitor.app so I can attach a sample to this radar, but I never see one highlighted in red. Happy to take samples or run other diagnostics. Attaching a system report."
