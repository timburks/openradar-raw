        Summary:
        In Albums view the artist name does not appear under all albums. It is only visible under two albums. These two have now discernible relevance as they havenâ€™t been played recently or in any order before or after other albums missing artist names.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Keep iTunes in Albums view forever and ever because album art is great
        2. Notice, after right-clicking to add an album to the current playlist, that artist names are missing

        Expected Results:
        Artist names should always accompany an album

        Actual Results:
        Missing artist names.

        Regression:
        Unknown
