        Summary:
        The intrinsic content-height of UIButtons doesn't change when the title gets wrapped. Trying to use an UIButton with autolayout, so that the width / height automatically adopts accordingly to the title-label fails, as the intrinsic height of an UIButton doesn’t change when the title-label changes to multiple lines.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open and execute the attached project on an iPad (Simulator)
        2. Enter a long text in the textfield and end editing, so that the rename of the button is triggered
        3. If the text is long enough, title-label of the button will be wrapped in multiple lines, but the intrinsic content-height of the button didn’t change
        4. Thus, the text doesn’t fit inside the buttons frame

        Expected Results:
        The intrinsic-content-height of the button should change and autolayout should recalculate the layout

        Actual Results:
        The intrinsic-content-height of the button doesn’t change and the frame of the button is to small to show the full title label

        Regression:
        -
