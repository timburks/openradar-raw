    description: "Summary:\r\nSay that there are two devices, and at least one of them has iOS9b3. When communicating between these devices by BLE, both devices needs user to confirm \"Pairing Request\". Because BLE doesn't need pairing process, this looks quite strange. I haven't met this kind of alert view till iOS8, and even iOS9b2. Just since iOS9b3, and still on iOS9.0.1, this alert appears on both display.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get ready to make one of devices as peripheral, and start.\r\n2. Get ready to make other device as central, and start. (Actually, order of central and peripheral is not important. You may start central first.)\r\n3. Try to communicate between them\r\n4. The alert about \"Pairing Request\" appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alert should not be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn alert that asks to get pairing with other device shows.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9.0.1 [13A404]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone6plis\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Logs-2015.9.17-11.04.38.zip' was successfully uploaded."
