    description: "Summary:\r\nChanges to the content of text placeholders embedded in a table will not be reflected in the visible content of a document, or for that matter in e.g. a printed version of the document, until the table content has been clicked into as if to edit it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip attached PlaceholderScripting.zip\r\n2. Open TestPlaceholder document in Pages.\r\n3. Open PlaceholderScript in Script Editor.\r\n4. Run the script.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe content of columns 2 and 3 of the table in document 1 should have been updated to contain values \"6/13/15\" and \"Booyeah\" respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe original placeholder values persist in the table.\r\n\r\nTo get the updated values to appear, double click into any cell of the table as if to edit it.\r\n\r\nAs a side note: now click outside the table and Cmd-Z undo to reverse the scripted changes. Again, the model data have been updated but the UI doesn't reflect it. Double click in a cell again to get the changes to register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPages 5.6 (2553)\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PlaceholderScripting.zip' was successfully uploaded."
