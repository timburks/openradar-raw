    description: "Summary:\nhttps://selfsolve.apple.com now redirects to https://checkcoverage.apple.com which requires a Captcha to proceed.  Lacking an API, this breaks the ability to lookup one or multiple serial numbers to get warranty status, which is a need for customers with many Macs to manage (schools, corp, gov, etc).\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nRun a script which calls https://selfsolve.apple.com/wcResults.do?sn=SERIAL&Continue=Continue&cn=&locale=&caller where SERIAL is the serial number of the Mac (example:  https://github.com/chilcote/warranty)\n \nExpected Results:\nA data object (preferably json but this has been html for the past few years) containing the warranty information.\n\nActual Results:\nFails due to the Captcha.\n\nRegression:\nThis is a regression to how the self sorve warranty site previously worked, which itself was a regression from when the was a proper API. \n\nNotes:\nFor an example on how we were scripting against the self solve site: https://github.com/chilcote/warranty\n\nReally, we just need a proper API to be able to do multiple lookups.  Your enterprise customers should not have to be writing random scripts to do this."
