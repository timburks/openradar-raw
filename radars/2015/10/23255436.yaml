    description: "Summary:\r\nIn some cases it would be useful to extend a generic type under some conditions for the generic argument. \r\n\r\nFor example one could declare a protocol JSONEncodable to which all JSON types conform (e.g. Int, String, Bool, â€¦). Each array of these types is JSON encodable as well and should also conform to JSONEncodable if it only contains elements that conform to JSONEncodable. However, writing an extension of Array like the following gives the error: Extension of type 'Array' with constraints cannot have an inheritance clause\r\n\r\nextension Array: JSONDecodable where Element: JSONDecodable\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the sample project and try to compile it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code should compile and the array should conform to JSONEncodable if and only if its elements are JSONEncodable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe code does not compile\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1 (7B91b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SampleProject.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\nSample project contains the following code:\r\n\r\nprotocol JSONEncodable {}\r\n\r\nextension Int: JSONEncodable {}\r\nextension String: JSONEncodable {}\r\n\r\nextension Array: JSONEncodable where Element: JSONEncodable {\r\n}"
