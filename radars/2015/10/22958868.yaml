    description: "Summary:\nWhile filing rdar://22958267, I needed six attempts to successfully upload five screenshots into iTunes Connect, twice. All five images were under 1MB, and four of the five were under 400 KB. On the four failed attempts of the time I wound up looking at an indefinite spinning progress indicator, which would remain up for as long as I left it alone. \n\nThese results are entirely typical.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Try uploading images to iTunes Connect, singly or in groups\n\nExpected Results:\nThey should all arrive at iTunes Connect intact.\n\nActual Results:\nUsually, I canâ€™t upload five in a row, one at a time, without a failure. If I upload five in a group, I do not expect them all to arrive.\n\nI work around this by uploading five in a group and then doing something else for a little while. When I come back to iTC, if all five are there, I re-order them (see rdar://22958267), save, and then try again with the next resolution. If not, I reload the page, delete the existing screenshots, and try the upload again. This workaround is absurd.\n\nRegression:\nTo the best of my recollection, uploading images to iTunes Connect has always been flaky.\n\nNotes:\nI tested this today on Safari 9.0 (10601.1.56.2), on 10.10.5. Wired network connection, no unusual latency to the WAN. These results are the norm, not an exception, in every browser, regardless of network conditions."
