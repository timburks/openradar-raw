    description: "Summary:\r\nWatchConnectivity seems to fail updating its reachable state when the watch is deactivated and reactivated rapidly (lowered and raised within a 1-2 second time span). This occurs reliably on my devices.\r\n\r\nI've also written a test project to get you the simplest possible example of the bug. \r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2649851/WatchConnectivityTest.zip\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps 1 and 2 demonstrate how the framework should work.\r\n\r\n1) Lower the watch, allowing the WCSessionDelegate to get called and update the UI. \r\n\r\n2) Raise again to restore the previous state. \r\n\r\n3) Lower and raise the watch quickly (within 1-2 seconds) so the delegate doesn't get a chance to call before the Watch App reactivates.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nQuickly lowering and raising the watch should result in two calls to the WCSessionDelegate's sessionReachabilityDidChange method to make an accurate reflection of the Watch App state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe delegate gets called just once, reflecting the NOT reachable state and fails to call again to reflect the correct active state of the watch app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere's a video demonstration of the bug: https://youtu.be/hx7VR8IPxT8\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis has occurred on all iPhones and Apple Watch OS2 versions. It doesn't seem to happen on Simulator."
