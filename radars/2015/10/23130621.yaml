        Summary:

        When getting the distance between 2 `CLLocation`s where one was
        initialized with the latitude and longitude from
        `kCLLocationCoordinate2DInvalid`, the distance is 0. On OS X the
        distance is a very large number, showing that something has gone wrong.

        Steps to reproduce:

        1. Create 2 locations, one with `kCLLocationCoordinate2DInvalid` and one
           with a valid `CLLocationCoordinate2D`
        2. Get the `distanceFromLocation` with the 2 locations.

        OR

        1. Open the attached playgrounds, one for OS X and one for iOS

        Expected results:

        On iOS this call should return something that shows that the two
        locations do not have identical coordinates.

        Actual results:

        The locations appear to have the same coordinate.
