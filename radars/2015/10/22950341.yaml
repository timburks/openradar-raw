    description: |-
        In OS X 10.11, net-snmp-create-v3-user tries to append an “rwuser” line to /usr/share/snmp/snmpd.conf. This is not allowed in 10.11, even running as root.

        net-snmp-create-v3-user should either write to a permitted location, or snmpd.conf should be modified to permit this operation.
