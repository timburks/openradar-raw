    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing universal app links, apps can register to being able to open certain http(s) links. When tapping these links in safari, the 'page' will open in the app instead of in Safari. Safari / iOS have taken measures to prevent this behavior while you are browsing on the same domain, which is correct, in my opinon. However, it seems that a switch from http to https (e.g. when going into the checkout area of a webshop) is interpreted as a domain change and will open the app instead of allowing the user to remain using the site in Safari. I think this is incorrect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app that has universal linking\r\n2. go to the associated website, via http\r\n3. tap a https link on that site\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect the https link to load in Safari\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app is opened. The only context that the app has is the checkout link, which is not enough to provide a good experience.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s or 6s plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
