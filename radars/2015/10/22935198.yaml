        Summary:
        I archive, rather than delete, most of my messages in Mail. The new swipe feature in El Capitan allows you to delete a message, but provides no way to archive a message. I would like to see an option to do this, either as a preference in Mail (perhaps per-account) or by providing both an "Archive" and a "Delete" button when swiping to the left on a message.
