    description: "Summary:\nWhen opening certain older Xcode projects, Xcode doesn’t show “Enable bitcode” under Build Options for the targets. Updating to recommended settings does not help either. It seems to maybe be with Xcode projects that only have framework targets?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. From github, check out https://github.com/TTTAttributedLabel/TTTAttributedLabel, at commit: 00ff15df0cf5b0da7e8ad72b68d2d05536533aa7, or open attached Xcode project\n2. Open Carthage/TTTAttributedLabel.xcodeproj\n3. Open the TTTAttributedLabel iOS target.\n4. Go to Build Options\n\nExpected Results:\n“Enable bitcode” should be a row, from which you can enable/disable bitcode.\n\nActual Results:\n“Enable bitcode” is not under Build Options\n\nNotes:\nI believe you can set a User-Defined setting for ENABLE_BITCODE to work around the missing row. \nAlso see screenshot: http://cl.ly/image/0n1k1I2p1F3Z"
