    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Server.app 5.0.3, there's an undocumented feature that allows Server's initial setup to be performed entirely from the command line. The procedure is interactive and requires keyboard input to agree to the Server license as well as entering an administrator's username and password.\r\n\r\nEnhancement Request:\r\n\r\nI would like a command-line switch that allows for a silent install when the 'setup' command is run with root privileges. The silent install would include automatic agreement to the license agreement and admin authorization.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install Server.app 5.0.3\r\n2. Open Terminal\r\n3. Enter the following command:\r\n\r\nsudo server setup\r\n\r\n4. The following output appears:\r\n\r\ncomputername:~ administrator$ sudo server setup\r\nPassword:\r\nTo use server, you must agree to the terms of the software license agreement.\r\n\r\nPress Return to view the software license agreement.\r\n\r\n5. On pressing the Return key, the license agreement appears:\r\n\r\n---insert license agreement here---\r\n\r\n6. Agreement to the license agreement is requested:\r\n\r\nDo you agree to the terms of the software license agreement? (y/N) y\r\n\r\n7. Administrator authorization is requested:\r\n\r\nAdministrator access is required to set up OS X Server on this Mac. Type an administrator's user name and password to allow this.\r\nUser name: administrator\r\nPassword: \r\n\r\n8.
