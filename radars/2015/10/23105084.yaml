    description: "Starting with iOS 9.0 the Simulator doesn't support Copy and Paste anymore. Copying the iPhone pasteboard to the Mac and vice versa doesn't work anymore. The menu command is enabled but essentially a NOOP.\r\n\r\nRegression\r\nThis works fine using the Xcode 7.0.1 developer tools when an iOS 8.4 Simulator is started.\r\n\r\nThe problem also occurs in Xcode 7.1 beta (7B85) using an iOS 9.1 Simulator."
