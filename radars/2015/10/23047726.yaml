    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen typing the word “Fridays,” such as in the phrase “Fridays in October,” the iOS autocorrect inserts an apostrophe to make it “Friday's.”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app, like Notes, that uses autocorrect on a text field/text view.\r\n2. Write the word “Fridays.”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe word stays in the correct form.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe incorrect apostrophe is inserted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2 (13A452)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile there are some cases where an apostrophe is appropriate, such as “Friday’s good for me,” this should not be assumed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus, AT&T, 64GB"
