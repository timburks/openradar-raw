    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a notification from Reminders.app is sent, the user can choose to snooze this notification. On doing so another alert is displayed to let the user choose how long to snooze. This second alert shouldn't let iPhone vibrate or play a sound for a second time, as that gives the feeling that a second alert just came in in the background and the user and it gives no extra value.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set reminder\r\n2. Get alert for reminder\r\n3. Snooze reminder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSnooze alert shouldn't be giving of an alert sound or vibration, as the user's attention is already on the notification.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSnooze alert is sending an alert sound or vibration.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2 (13A452)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
