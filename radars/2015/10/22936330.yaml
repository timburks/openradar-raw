    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen OS X Server is opened, after some time system settings related to keyboard, mouse and trackpad get reset to factory defaults. For example, some gestures like tap or three fingers dragging. Also things set from terminal like \"defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Restart your computer\r\n2. Open Server.app\r\n3. Wait for things to happen... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI just want Server.app not to interfere with my system preferences.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's really a PITA when your keyboard at some point without any reason star being slow again or you lose some trackpad gestures...\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Server 5.0.15 (15S4010)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro and Mac Mini\r\n\r\nOS X El Capitan (15B22c)"
