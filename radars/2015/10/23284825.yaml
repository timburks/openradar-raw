    description: "Safari (and SFSafariViewController) support compiled content blocking lists for filtering pages, and it would be very useful for WKWebView to support these blocking lists for the same reasons. \r\n\r\nOur particular use case for Firefox for iOS is to support tracking protection lists, and there's currently no way to intercept requests made via WKWebView. An API like NSURLCache may also be useful if it worked with WKWebView, though the existing private content blocking API has a number of advantages, as it can:\r\n\r\n1) determine the origin of the request (for blocking third-party content),\r\n2) determine the types of resources being requested (presumably based on the DOM element requesting the resource), and\r\n3) work with existing iOS content blocking extensions.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is, of course, extremely valuable to Mozilla and our users, so having some degree of control over requests that websites are making will be important for us moving forward."
