        Summary:
        With the YouTube app (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/youtube/id544007664?mt=8) a number of content is viewable which violates the iOS Program License Agreement. Other apps are rejected for the same content, so the YouTube app should be subject to the same standards.

        E.g this video is viewable within the YouTube:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXCVyoVPO-k

        The same video was cited as a reason the rejection of the CCC tvOS app referring to the “Program License Agreement PLA 3.2(e)”: https://unthoughted.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/apple-verbietet-inhalte-vom-chaos-computer-club-auf-ihrer-plattform/ (english version: http://pastebin.com/zT1n0RPV )

        To reproduce:
        * install the YouTube app from the App Store
        * search for “$kernel.infect(): Creating a cryptovirus for Symfony2 apps”
