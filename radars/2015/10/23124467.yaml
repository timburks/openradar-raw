    description: "Summary:\r\niOS sends local notifications for HomeKit accessories of type Security Systems, Doors, Locks and Windows. These notifications can be dis-/enabled in iOS Settings > Notifications > HomeKit > {HomeName} > ...\r\n\r\nIt would nice to provide custom notification triggers for specific characteristic events e.g. if the Power State of Doorbell accessory is set to On, send a local notification to know that the doorbell rang.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere is currently no way to configure custom local notifications other then dis-/enabling predefined notifications.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProvide notification triggers which trigger local notifications on characteristic events.\r\n\r\nFor example a class `HMNotificationTrigger`, which is similar to `HMEventTrigger` but triggers a local notification instead of executing scenes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification triggers are currently not customisable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9"
