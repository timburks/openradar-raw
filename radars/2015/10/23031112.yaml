    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever one of the following things happen:\r\n\r\n1. Xcode update\r\n2. A new app is created and should compile to a device\r\n3. An app which was recently transferred to another developer account needs to be compiled\r\n4. A developer contract and its provisioning profiles get (auto-)renewed after a year\r\n5. a thousand other reasons… etc.\r\n\r\nYOU LAND IN PROVISIONING HELL:\r\nThat means the following...\r\n\r\n1. Your app does not compile.\r\n2. Xcode does not give the reason how to resolve the issue\r\n3. It is totally undeterminable which of the thousand parameters in Xcode's Excel-like desert of parameter fields has ONE wrong value\r\n4. You need to check at a thousand different places if stuff got broken (e.g. developer contract still valid? has iTC new buerocracy waiting to be okay'd? has iTC over night changed completely? Did the latest Xcode fail to synchronize with provisioning profiles & app-bundle-ids of member-center again? Did the last click on \"Fix it!\" make things even worse?)\r\n\r\nThis is waht we call provisioning hell. And it is a huge testament of fail for Apple WWDR. Because this one thing alone burns valuable developer hours every single day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to develop for the OS X, iOS, watchOS or tvOS… welcome to provisioning hell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is an EASY and i.e. UNDERSTANDABLE way of dealing with rightsmanagement that is FAILSAFE and NOT depending on a thousand different entries in Xcode's Excel-like desert of parameter fields.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHELL.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.1 beta (7B75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
