        Summary:
        Since iOS 9, I cannot connect Midi devices using a Yamaha UX16 connector + a camera connection kit (worked on iOS 8 and earlier versions).

        (See http://usa.yamaha.com/products/music-production/accessories/usb-midi/ux16/)

        This is a serious regression that affects many of our users that purchased this connector to be used with Piano Maestro.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Upgrade device to iOS 9
        2. Try to connect a MIDI device using Yamaha UX16 connector + a camera connection kit

        Expected Results:
        You would be able to use the MIDI device using this connector with apps like Piano Maestro.

        Actual Results:
        You get an error message.

        Regression:
        Does not occur in iOS 8 or earlier
