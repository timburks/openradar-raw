    description: "Summary:\r\nUIKit provides the methods viewWillTransitionToSize and willTransitionToTraitCollection, but sometimes I want to do something that depends on both the future size and trait collection. For example, we want to use two columns only in a regular × regular size class where the width is greater than the height.\r\n\r\nWe can of course ignore UIKit’s size classes and define our own size thresholds, but this is not always desirable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to do something that depends on both the future size and trait collection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaybe some API that provides both the future size and trait collection, or a way to get the size class from a width or height.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such API that I know of. I went with defining my own thresholds and investigating what UIKit does to ensure they match.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, Xcode 7.1 (7B91b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
