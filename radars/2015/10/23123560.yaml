    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease see the attached bare-bones app. When you click the Open button, you'll see the second view controller appear as a modal view. (The segue is \"present modally\".)\r\n\r\nIf you put some default text into the UITextView in SecondViewController, via the storyboard, the view will not load. You can set the text programmatically, for example in SecondViewController's viewWillAppear method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the app in Xcode 7.0.1 with iOS 9.0.2.\r\n2. Click the Open button. The SecondViewController will be displayed. There is a yellow UITextView at the top. It will have no text in it.\r\n3. Stop the app.\r\n4. In the storyboard, add some text to the UITextView.\r\n5. Build and run the app.\r\n6. Click the Open button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the SecondViewController to be displayed with the default text that has been entered into the UITextView.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view will not be loaded. It will appear as though the app has frozen. iOS seems to think the view has loaded, but it hasn't.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 and iOS 9.0.2, Xcode 7.0.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone, iOS Simulator"
