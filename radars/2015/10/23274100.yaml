    description: "Summary:\r\nUIPageViewController makes extensive use of device orientation, which is not a good idea now we have multitasking on iPad. Apps should be more adaptive.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, the only way to change the spine location of page view controller is using the delegate method pageViewController:spineLocationForInterfaceOrientation:, and this is only called when the device rotates, not when changing size due to entering or leaving Split View. It also only provides an orientation, but a size is needed to make a sensible, adaptive decision.\r\n\r\nAttached is a screen shot of Xcode’s Page-Based Application template, using two page because it is in landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project in Xcode and use the Page-Based Application template.\r\n2. Run the app on iPad Air 2.\r\n3. Experiment with combinations of device orientations, Split View and Slide Over.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe word ‘orientation’ should not appear in the UIPageViewController API.\r\n\r\nUIPageViewController’s delegate should have the chance to make modifications for all size changes. (It would help if spineLocation was a writable property, then we could just use viewWillTransitionToSize.)\r\n\r\nXcode’s Page-Based Application template should not use orientation and userInterfaceIdiom checks, and instead decide to use two pages if the size available is sufficiently large and wide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can find no way to update a UIPageViewController’s spineLocation in response to entering and leaving Split View. I’ll keep looking for a workaround.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, Xcode 7.1 (7B91b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'landscape.png' was successfully uploaded."
