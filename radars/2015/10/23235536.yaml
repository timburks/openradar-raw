        Summary:
        When indexing content with CSSearchableIndex search results are often unpredictable. The particular context for the issue we’ve run into is as follows: we want to index all of a user’s subscribed podcasts, and the episodes of those podcasts, so that they can easily find them through spotlight. However, if we index all episodes of a podcast then search results don’t have a clear priority. For example a search for “Sample Podcast” would return a seemingly random selection of episodes of that podcast rather than the podcast itself or the latest episodes. We’ve fallen back to just indexing podcasts rather than individual episodes, but this is less powerful a feature for users.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Run the attached sample project
        2. It indexes an individual podcast, and 99 episodes of the same podcast
        3. Do a spotlight search for “Sample Podcast”, the name of this podcast

        Expected Results:
        Spotlight shows a search result for “Sample Podcast” and/or a selection of the latest episodes

        Actual Results:
        Spotlight shows episodes 88, 89, and 90

        Regression:
        Tested on device and in simulator, iOS 9.0 and 9.1
