    description: "Summary:\r\nThe reachability status of accessories is not updated and monitored by HomeKit on watchOS 2.0. Which results in `HMAccessory.reachable`  is always true and the delegate method `accessoryDidUpdateReachability()` is never called when the reachability changed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup a HomeKit environment (create a home, and pair with accessory)\r\n2. Create a watchOS 2.0 app to access the accessory\r\n3. Check the `reachable` property of `HMAccessory`, which is always true even when the accessory is not reachable.\r\n4. Assign an object to the `delegate` property of `HMAccessory`. When the accessory changes reachability (becomes reachable or not reachable) the delegate method `accessoryDidUpdateReachability()` is never called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe accessory reachability status on watchOS 2 should be the same as on iOS 9.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe reachable property is always true and accessoryDidUpdateReachability() is never called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch"
