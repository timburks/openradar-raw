    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the ARD function \"Observe\", your viewport expands and contracts in a loop when you load a PowerPoint in Fullscreen on the observed station. This also makes the main thread of ARD hang and diminishes responsiveness.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On 10.10.1, load ARD 3.8 viewer. \r\n2. On 10.9.5, load a PowerPoint in Office 2011 (latest version).\r\n3. Observe Mavericks computer in ARD. \r\n4. Start powerpoint in fullscreen.\r\n5. Observe wackiness. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI actually don't know, due to PowerPoint's weird two-screen mode, were even in \"Mirrored\" mode, it shows the presenter a different view. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWonky contracting and expanding. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAdmin: El Capitán 10.11.1\r\nGuest: Mavericks 10.9.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCheers! \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAdmin: 15 rMBP, ARD 3.8, El Capitán 10.11.1\r\nGuest: 23\" 2012 iMac, Mavericks 10.9.5, ARD 3.8.4"
