    description: "Summary:\r\nProgramatically scrolling a collection view after setting the estimated item size crash if the user has not already scrolled to the destination position.\r\n\r\nFrom the attached backtrace it appears to be a divide by zero issue while calculating layout attributes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project.\r\n2. Without manually scrolling, tap the \"Scroll to Index Path...\" toolbar button to initiate a programatic scroll.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCollection view scrolls to specified index path.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes with apparent divide by zero layout calculation exception.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you comment out the estimated item size code in -[ViewController viewDidLoad], the app will not crash when attempting programatic scrolling.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'collection_view_backtrace.txt' and 'CollectionViewScroll.zip' were successfully uploaded."
