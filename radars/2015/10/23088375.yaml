        Summary:
        Starting a streaming song (i.e. not available offline) from iTunes Match while connected to Airplay on Apple TV causes music to wait indefinitely. The spinner spins and the music NEVER loads.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Restart iPhone
        2. Open Music
        3. Ensure show offline music only is NOT checked
        4. Navigate to a track that is not available offline, but do not start it yet
        5. Swipe up the system controls from the bottom of the screen and select Apple TV from the Airplay menu
        6. Tap the track to begin streaming

        Expected Results:
        Within a few seconds, the track should begin both streaming and then sending to the Airplay receiver (Apple TV).

        Actual Results:
        The loading spinner spins and the progress remains at 0 (absolute left). There is no time-out message or any other error.

        Regression:
        Doing the same test with a track that is available offline (i.e. already downloaded) works perfectly and starts playing on the Airplay receiver within 3 seconds.

        Notes:
        If Airplay is disconnected and output device is set to the phone again, streaming and playback will suddenly resume. If Airplay is selected again, it’s possible that it may work after about 10-15 seconds, or it might not work again. It’s easier to reproduce this on the 5s. The only reliable fix is to restart the phone and not try to stream whilst using Airplay. If you do, it seems to cause a bug that hangs around until you restart.
