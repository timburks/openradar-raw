        Summary:
        Please add API access to the Siri remote’s microphone on tvOS.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        There is no access to the Siri remote’s microphone.  This would be very beneficial to allow porting of an iOS app I work on, where tvOS would otherwise be a fantastic use case.

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A
