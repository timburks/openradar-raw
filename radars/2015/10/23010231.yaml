    description: "NSData lacks many stdlib features. In particular it is not a CollectionType and it is not a value type. This makes it somewhat cumbersome to use in Swift. It’s API is also at odds with usual stdlib conventions (using “length” rather than “count” for instance). \n\nThere is no easy way to bridge an NSData to and from a stdlib type like [UInt8] without copying.\n\nNSData should bridge to stdlib similar to how NSString and NSArray do. This could be as a “Data” (following NSArray -> Array) or something related to ManagedBuffer, or could be a [UInt8]. I believe I would prefer it to be a specific Data type. This would likely make it easier to deal with NSData subclasses (particularly dispatch_data). But it should bridge to something in stdlib."
