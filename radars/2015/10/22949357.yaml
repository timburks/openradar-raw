    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen documenting an indented Swift function or property with /** */, if it is indented with tabs the body of the comment will be interpreted as if it were intended within the comment, not markdown. When indented with spaces it is correctly interpreted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a simple data structure with a property and document it, indenting with tabs (this text is indented with spaces):\r\n\r\nstruct SomeStruct {\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n    Some text about `someProperty`.\r\n    */\r\n    var someProperty: AnyObject\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOption-clicking on someProperty shows the correct markdown-formatted documentation. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe documentation is shown as preformatted text in a darkened box, as if it were indented within the comment. If the same comment text is indented with spaces, it is correctly formatted using markdown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0.1 (7A1001)\r\nVersion 7.1 beta (7B60)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens in all known Xcode 7 versions."
