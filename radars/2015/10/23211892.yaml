    description: "Summary:\r\nI've tested that the retain cycle does not exist in iOS 8.4, but does exist in iOS 9.1. I've put together a sample project to easily confirm whether or not UISplitViewController causes itself to leak (just run it and check the console output).\r\n\r\nThis also tests an attempt to allow the master and detail view controllers to be deallocated. As one can see, the master view controller still seems to be retained by the UISplitViewController even after it is removed from the UISplitViewController.viewControllers array property.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open my sample project\r\n2. Run on the simulator or device for various iOS SDK versions\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that UISplitViewController and its master view controller be released\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUISplitViewController is not released, and neither is its master view controller\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm discussing on this thread in the dev forums: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/15054\r\n\r\nand here on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33271149/does-uisplitviewcontroller-have-a-retain-cycle-bug-in-ios-9/33271150?noredirect=1#comment54343301_33271150\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UISplitViewControllerRetainCycleTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
