    description: "Devashish Chandra09-Oct-2015 04:42 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have tests (for example testing different login types), which require that the user not be logged into the app before the test starts.\r\n\r\nThis would be much easier to do if there was a way to reset application data before launching the app, currently XCode does not provide any way to do so.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 (7A220)\r\nOSX 10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
