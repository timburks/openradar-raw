    description: "05-Oct-2015 06:40 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDisk Utility.app in El Capitan should support multiple windows like previous versions of Disk Utility so that parallel operations can be conducted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Disk Utility\r\n2. Initiate a long-running disk operation, such as a zero write format\r\n3. While the long-running disk operation is active, try to do another operation on a different hard drive.\r\n\r\nExample scenarios:\r\n- Formatting two external hard drives at the same time\r\n- Making changes to multiple disks at the same time while waiting for one or the other to complete changes\r\n- Viewing other disk information while an operation is in progress\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to open multiple Disk Utility windows like in previous versions of Disk Utility OR, I expect to be able to execute multiple parallel disk operations when appropriate [i.e. on different disks]\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly one disk operation can be conducted at a time through the Disk Utility application. The only way to conduct multiple parallel operations is to drop to Terminal and use diskutility directly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
