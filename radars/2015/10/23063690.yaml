        Summary:
        I have a protocol extension to which I have added extensions defining much of the behaviour of my system. Several methods use the same dictionary type involving Self for different purposes, so I made a typealias for each different purpose as documentation. This causes typechecking to fail.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. This code:
        protocol P {}

        extension P {
        	typealias T = [String:Self]
        }

        extension P {
        	func f(t: T) {
        		g(t)
        	}

        	func g(t: T) {}
        }


        Expected Results:
        should typecheck


        Actual Results:
        but totally doesn’t:
        boom.swift:9:5: error: cannot convert value of type '[String : Self]' to expected argument type '[String : _]'
                        g(t)
                          ^


        Regression:
        It seems to be fine if `f`’s parameter type is changed from `T` to `[String:Self]`. I.e. it can match `[String:Self]` against the type `T` in `g`’s definition, but it can’t match `T` against `T`.
