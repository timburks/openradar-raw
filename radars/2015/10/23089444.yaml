    description: "With VoiceOver turned on, node.focus() will scroll a node that's part of overflow: scroll to its fixed position on the page, not its position within the scrolling node. You must have content above the scrolling node in order to push the scrolling content.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached file in Safari\r\n2. Turn VoiceOver on\r\n3. The script should be running automatically\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe focused row should be visible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe focused row will be hidden inside the scrolling node until it reaches a row where the nested scroll offset matches its offset on the page."
