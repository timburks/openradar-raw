    description: "Summary:\r\nEven after setting the CFBundleDisplayName and NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription keys in Info.plist, Location Services are not available in the tvOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new tvOS app.\r\n2. Add required CFBundleDisplayName and NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription keys to Info.plist per tvOS beta FAQ (https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/70381).\r\n3. Add simple location manager that initializes CLLocationManager and calls -requestLocation().\r\n4. Build and run in Simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn authorization UIAlertController should prompt the user to allow / deny the app access to Location Services in the Simulator. Upon allowing access, the Simulator should be able to spoof location using the Debug > Location menu item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn authorization UIAlertController for access to Location Services flashes on-screen in the Simulator for a moment, being dismissed before user interaction is possible."
