        Summary:
        Please add API for SFSafariViewController to prevent navigation bar from shrinking. I recommend this because as I watch myself and my customers use SFSafariViewController for displaying web page content, they are surprised when they canâ€™t immediately see the UI for dismissing the view controller. While this behavior may be appropriate for MobileSafari, it feels out of place in other apps that have their own way of dismissing modals.
