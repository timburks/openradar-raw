        Summary:
        The ternary operator is hard to read. The condition is introduced without any fanfare, and the consequences are separated by punctuation that bears little relation to its intent.

        I suggest replacing it with an `if`/`then`/`else` expression which enjoys the same semantics, i.e. any time you have this:

        	x ? y : z

        you can replace it with this much clearer expression:

        	if x then y else z

        This also formats well over multiple lines, introducing each term with a keyword which explains its purpose quite clearly:

        	if condition
        		then consequence
        		else alternative

        Note that this suggestion does _not_ add Ruby-esque postfix conditions:

        	doSomething() if condition

        IMO, in the general case, that form suffers the same sort of problem that makes the ternary conditional operator hard to read.
