    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter the last OS X update, Safari has started eating up CPU, about 100% of it, and excessively logging this one particular message. Opening Console to view the logs makes it worse since then Console starts taking up 100+% of CPU. This does not show up as \"using significant energy\" though it definitely has caused my battery life to diminish.\r\n\r\nI've attached screenshots from Activity Monitor and Console.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: I cannot update to 10.11 to fix this because the iOS 7 Simulator, which I need for my job, does not run on 10.11*\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Click in the launch bar\r\n3. Search, type in a URL, or load a bookmark (basically do anything to get the suggestions dropdown).\r\n4. Go to site\r\n5. :-O\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Safari to not take up 100% of cpu unless some heavy, intense calculation is going on (which should be rare).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari eats up a bunch of CPU for seemingly no reason\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.5 (14F27)\r\nSafari 9.0 (10601.1.56.2)"
