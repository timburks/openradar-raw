    description: "Joshua Junon <16-Oct-2015 05:37 PM>\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUpon using [NSFileManager trashItemAtURL:resultingItemURL:error:], the originating path is not stored in the .DS_Store file, causing the `Put Back` option not to be shown for programmatically trashed files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Touch/create `foobar` file\r\n2. Compile the attached code (trash-basic.m)\r\n3. Run the resulting binary (no arguments required).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`foobar` should show up in the Trash with the context menu option to `Put Back` to where it was originally located.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`Put Back` is missing altogether from the context menu; file doesn't show up in .DS_Store listings.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan, but reported on various other versions as well (see Additional Notes of this report).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis report was originally filed by Sindre Sorhus over at https://github.com/sindresorhus/osx-trash/issues/4. A few people have reported `Put Back` appears with a single file, but subsequent files do not. I have personally not seen a single file work at all.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'trash-basic.m' was successfully uploaded."
