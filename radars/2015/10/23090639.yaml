        Summary:
        If you are on 10.10 with a 802.1x Profile installed and authenticated to your network, after upgrading to 10.11, it will not automatically reconnect to the network and use the 802.1x profile it had been using prior to the upgrade. You *must* go into Network settings and click the 'Connect' button to auth using the installed 802.1x profile.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Start on OS X 10.10
        2. Install a 802.1x Profile and authenticate to your network
        3. Upgrade to 10.11
        4. Check network settings, it can be unauthenticated after upgrading (sporadic)

        Expected Results:
        It should use the same 802.1x profile automatically after upgrade.

        Actual Results:
        It does not automatically use the 802.1x profile after upgrading.

        Regression:
        This seems to occur upgrading from 10.10 => 10.11

        Notes:
        This is particularly bad when upgrading a remote machine. You'll upgrade the machine and then upon the install completing, you can no longer get to it as it will not auth to the network automatically.
