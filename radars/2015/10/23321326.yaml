    description: "Summary:\r\nIf parental controls time limits are enabled on a \"Local Network User\" and that user times out, there is no way to gracefully log out that user or add more time for that user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Create a profile with time limits for any user\r\n2.) Let that user run out of time\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect a way for an administrator to log out the timed out user and or an administrator should be able to add time to a timed out user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser remains logged in but unable to login to the computer.  There is no apparent way for the administrator to gracefully log out the user or add more time for that user\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on OS X 10.11.1 With Server.app 5.0.15 With a profile installed for parental controls time limits set at 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis worked just perfectly under OS X 10.6.9.  An admin used to be able to unlock the account, and add more time to the user.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUsing network homes with Local Network Users"
