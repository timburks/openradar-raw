    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a collection view controller modally or pushed to a navigation controller with the extended status bar (e.g. in call, personal hotspot on etc), you can't set the collection view's contentOffset in viewWillAppear, only in viewDidAppear. With the regular status bar, setting the contentOffset in viewWillAppear works.\r\nThis happens both with vertical and horizontal layouts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a collection view controller, and populate it with some cells (enough to enable scrolling)\r\n- On the collection view controller, set the contentOffset of the collection view to a value beyond (0, 0) (depending on the layout scroll direction) in viewWillAppear\r\n- Present this collection view controller modally or pushed to a navigation controller, with an extended status bar. You will notice that contentOffset has no effect.\r\n- Test again with the regular status bar: it works as expected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContent offset of collectionView set on viewWillAppear should be set even with the extended status bar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent offset of collectionView set on viewWillAppear is not set on the collectionView with the extended status bar\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1 [13B143]"
