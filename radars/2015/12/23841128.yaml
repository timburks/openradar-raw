    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Add to Up Next\" feature behaves differently on iOS vs Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a Mac, play an album. \r\n2. See a playlist, click \"Add to Up Next.\"\r\n3. The album keeps playing, and when it gets to the end of the last song, the playlist starts. (This is new as of [OS X 10.11.2 / iTunes 12.3.1.23]- thank you so much, it’s wonderful!)\r\n4. Now, go over to your iPhone, and play an album.\r\n5. Still on iPhone, find another playlist, and tap “Add to Up Next”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe album will play through, then the playlist will start - just like on my Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe current song finishes, then the playlist starts, then once the playlist is done, it goes back to the album. \r\n\r\nThis is the terribly-frustrating behavior that drove me nuts about Apple Music at first, and I was really excited to see it fixed in OS X 10.11.2 this week - but it looks like the iOS implementation didn't get the same update!\r\n\r\nCan you please update iOS iTunes to have the same behavior as [OS X 10.11.2 / iTunes 12.3.1.23]?\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.2\r\niTunes 12.3.1.23\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nsuccessfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFor OpenRadar folks, here are the attachments: http://clrk.it/1jqUP+"
