    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://21387804\r\n\r\nThe iOS 9 “universal links” system allows applications to specify “associated domains,” domains whose links the application can intercept. These domains look as follows; please note that a separate entry is required for each specific subdomain:\r\n\r\napplinks:sharefile.com\r\napplinks:www.sharefile.com\r\n\r\nShareFile uses a different subdomain for each distinct account, e.g. an account can be found at “https://rdarexample.sharefile.com”\r\n\r\nIn order to open account links in the native ShareFile app, we would need to be able to specify a wildcarded associated domain as follows:\r\n\r\napplinks:*.sharefile.com\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry using an asterisk to specify a wildcarded associated domain (e.g. “*.sharefile.com”) for universal links.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLinks to any subdomain under the domain (e.g. “rdarexample.sharefile.com”) would be routed to the third-party application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLinks to subdomains open in Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
