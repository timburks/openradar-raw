        Summary:
        When pressing cmd+w Safari closes the current tab. However, with only one tab left open (and a couple of sticky tabs), pressing cmd+w closes the window instead of the tab. File -> Close tab isn’t available in this case.

        This is an issue since Safari introduced sticky tabs.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Configure Safari to have at least one sticky tab
        - Open one separate tab
        - Press cmd+w / try to select File -> Close Tab

        Expected Results:
        The current tab closes, showing the default ‘favourites tab’, leaving the window open to let the user access the sticky tabs.

        Actual Results:
        The window closes, the current page in a sticky tab is lost.

        Regression:
        The main problem is, that the sticky tabs loose their history and their current page as soon as the window is closes. As a user I always want to have my Safari tab open in order to navigate to my sticky tabs, no matter if I have another tab open or not.
