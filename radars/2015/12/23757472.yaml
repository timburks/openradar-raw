    description: "Summary:\r\nThe manpages for 'host' and 'dig' correctly point out that most OS X tools have a different lookup behavior:\r\n\r\nMac OS X NOTICE\r\n       The host command does not use the host name and address resolution or\r\n       the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on Mac\r\n       OS X.  The results of name or address queries printed by host may\r\n       differ from those found by other processes that use the Mac OS X native\r\n       name and address resolution mechanisms.  The results of DNS queries may\r\n       also differ from queries that use the Mac OS X DNS routing library.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not clear from this description how to work around this.\r\n\r\nTo get roughly the expected results from 'host example.com', 'dscacheutil -q host -a name example.com' appears to be a suitable substitute.\r\n\r\nThe manpages should be amended to point to dscacheutil's -q host feature, and ideally, there should be a shortcut for a simpler syntax; as a workaround, I use this alias:\r\n\r\nalias osxhost \"dscacheutil -q host -a name\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. look up example.com using 'host'\r\n2. notice discrepancy between 'host' and e.g. Safari\r\n3. notice that 'host' manpage points this out\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe manpage helpfully shows me the command I probably meant to use, which is dscacheutil -q host -a.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe manpage doesn't provide a resolution.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.2 Beta (15C48a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe dscacheutil manpage is lacking in examples; there's not a single host lookup example."
