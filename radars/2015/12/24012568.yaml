        Summary:
        Since code coverage info is shown to the right of a file’s lines, it gets easily scrolled out of view for files with long lines or narrow windows

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run unit tests covering a file with a single line that is 500 characters wide

        Expected Results:
        You’re easily able to see the code coverage data without scrolling to the right. Either it floats on the window’s right margin (rather than the file’s) or it shows on the left margin instead

        Actual Results:
        You need to scroll way over to the right, and then it’s impossible to even tell which lines the code coverage numbers correspond to
