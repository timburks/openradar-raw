        No example needed on this one, can be reproduced with stock apps.

        I tested in landscape with calendar on main side and contacts on right (small) side and rotating with keyboard up.

        Follow the video to see my steps. Playing a bit around with it confuses the indicator and it gets stuck in a wrong position.
        The key here seems to be rotating with the keyboard visible.
