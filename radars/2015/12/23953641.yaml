        Summary:
        If you have some novice users, and they ask you how they can rename a file in Finder, the natural answer I guess would be: „Right click or click on this gear icon after you selected it and click <<change name>>“. Well, as it turns out, this option simply doesn’t exist. I also really don’t think that sending users to the info window, where they have to expand the name tab, to then change the name is the way to go.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to rename a file by right click or option click in Finder.

        Expected Results:
        A menu item „rename item“ should be present.

        Actual Results:
        No way of renaming a file with a UI visible mouse click. And going to information->name and suffix isn’t really intuitive either

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
