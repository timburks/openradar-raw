        Summary:

        TestFlight External Testing dialog to “Add Build to Test” is poor UI.

        If you have a checkbox, it should only behave as a checkbox. This creates a very confusing UI experience.

        When I select a build, you should not make the checkbox row a link to the build itself.

        I already know that I want to send a build to my testers (because my last build auto-expired) and I don’t need to look at the details.

        Please remove the link to the build details from the checkbox.

        I feel like I’m going in loops with the UI on TestFlight + iTunesConnect because you don’t provide context for transitions… or do weird things like links on a checkbox.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Upload new build from Xcode 7
        2. Wait forever for it to become available
        3. Go to TestFlight > External Testing > (right side) Add Build to Test (doesn’t look like a button) > Go to select a Build (Click on the left most and it selects, click on anything else and it takes you to the build itself)

        Expected Results:

        1. Clicking anywhere on the row should select the build

        Actual Results:

        1. Clicking on the right selects the build
        2. Clicking on the left side (90% of the row) takes me to the build page (which I do not want)

        Regression:

        The UI and flow is awful on iTunesConnect. This is a huge regression from Test Flight before Apple… where the flow was semi-coherent.

        Buttons are all over the place, some buttons have outlines, some buttons are hidden hyperlinks.

        Some buttons don’t commit changes unless you save… super hard to use!!!!

        Next time, try adding a beta tester… don’t forget to Save!
