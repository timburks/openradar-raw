    description: "Summary:\r\nWe cannot add our enterprise developer team to the Xcode service in the Mac OS X Server. After logging in with an Apple ID of a team agent, a message is displayed, that we are not enrolled in a developer program that supports this feature.\r\n\r\nIf we log in to the developer program website we can see, that a new entry has been added for the server which says \"Certificate Enabled\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup Xcode and X Server for enterprise app CI, run tests successfully via simulator.\r\n2. Try to add enterprise development team to run tests on actual devices.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEnterprise development team can be added and devices of that team can be used."
