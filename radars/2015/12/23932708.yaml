    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I install an update to my app the old fashioned way, via Xcode, the Today widget stops working. It will continue to display whatever was last displayed there, or may be empty in some cases. The problem is not resolved until the device is restarted. This issue seems to be specific to manually updating an app through Xcode over USB—it's not an issue with TestFlight. Since I have a Mac app and use CloudKit, simply using TestFlight isn't an option (rdar://19793488)—I have to restart multiple test devices multiple times a day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app on a device that includes a Today widget.\r\n2. Make sure that Today widget is active and displaying in notification center. (I don't think the bug will trigger unless the old version of the widget is displayed once.)\r\n3. Close Notification Center\r\n4. Open the Xcode Devices window\r\n5. Connect the device via USB\r\n6. Select the device in the Devices window\r\n7. Drag an .ipa to the device's list of applications to install it—this can even be the same build that's already installed.\r\n8. Open Notification Center.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe newly installed Today widget should load successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt will continue to display whatever was last displayed there, or may be empty in some cases.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2, though this has been happening since 8.0 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm attaching a log of what the console spits out after opening Notification Center with the new build installed. It seems to be aware there's a new version of the app installed, but then fails to load the storyboard and throws an exception. The crash report from that is also included.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, AT&T, 128GB, and several other devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
