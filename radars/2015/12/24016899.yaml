    description: "Summary:\r\nThe text of the installation instructions for \"OS X El Capitan Update Developer Beta 1 10.11.3\" indicates that users \"will not be able to revert back\" to [their] previous system after updating.\"\r\n\r\nSince \"revert\" means \"to go back,\" using it as above means \"...not be able to go back back...\" in which case the \"back\" is redundant and should be removed from the text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOption a) Review the attached screenshot\r\nOption b) Open the App Store on a Mac that has installed previous beta versions of OS X but has not yet installed OS X El Capitan Update Developer Beta 1 10.11.3. Read the text of the Installation Instructions and weep. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText should read:\r\nClick Update to download and install the 10.11.3 seed. You will not be able to revert to your previous system after updating. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText reads:\r\nClick Update to download and install the 10.11.3 seed. You will not be able to revert back to your previous system after updating. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n15\" Retina MBP, Thunderbolt Display\r\nOS 10.11.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'revert_back.png' was successfully uploaded."
