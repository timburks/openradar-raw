        Summary:
        Commenting out Objective-C code in UI testing doesnâ€™t work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        For your OS X application project
        1. Create a UI testing target and select objective-c as your language
        2. Record some actions interacting with the application.
        3. Stop recording.
        4. Check to see if some of the recorded actions have a drop down menu providing different options for accessing the UI element.
        5. If so comment out that bit of code using /* and */
        6. Code is not properly commented out.

        Expected Results:
        Code should be properly commented out

        Actual Results:
        Get compile errors because part of the code is not commented out.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.

        The text that broke this for me is:

        /*@START_MENU_TOKEN@*/.menuItems["Children & Happiness_analysis"]/*[[".menuBarItems[\"Project\"]",".menuItems[\"Open Recent\"]",".menus.menuItems[\"Children & Happiness_analysis\"]",".menuItems[\"Children & Happiness_analysis\"]"],[[[-1,3],[-1,2],[-1,1,2],[-1,0,1]],[[-1,3],[-1,2],[-1,1,2]],[[-1,3],[-1,2]]],[0]]@END_MENU_TOKEN@*/
