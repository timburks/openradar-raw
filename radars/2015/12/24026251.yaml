    description: "Summary:\r\n============================================\r\nPingFang has lack of support regarding some Pan-CJK dingbat character glyphs. At least PingFangTC is compromised by this issue. This will trigger another issue reported on radar #21335773: \"CoreText has lack of per-glyph-fallback-necessity-check on iOS.\"\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n============================================\r\n1. Try type the following dingbat symbol into a song name or its artist information in iTunes:\r\n//KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT, Unicode: U+30FB„ÄÅUTF-8: E3 83 BB\r\n2. Synchronize this song to any iOS device running iOS 9 (in my case, iOS 9.2.0).\r\n3. Check the song name or artist information displayed in iOS built-in Music app.\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n============================================\r\nIn my case, the attached screenshot (https://twitter.com/ShikiSuen/status/682258464165367810) is supposed to display everything in PingFangTC (which is the default UI font under Chinese Traditional (Taiwan) Interface Language).\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n============================================\r\nSee screenshot (https://twitter.com/ShikiSuen/status/682258464165367810), shows that the unsolved bug #21335773 has been triggered due to PingFangTC's lack of support to dingbat symbol U+30FB.\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.0 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n============================================\r\n1. I hadn't tested whether the related issue #21335773 still exists in OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 (15C50); However, OS X Dev Beta 7 has such bug exists.\r\n2. I am really wondering that you are not going to fix issue #21335773 forever. This issue really irritates me well.\r\n3. Such lack of support towards pan-CJK dingbats wasn't exist in your previous Chinese system fonts (STHeiti, which was awfully designed and produced but got more pan-CJK dingbat characters supplied).\r\n--------------------------------------------"
