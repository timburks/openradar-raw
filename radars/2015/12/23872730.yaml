    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like to know when Photos is downloading content from my Photo Stream and when that is complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake pictures with iPhone tied to the same Apple ID with Photo Stream turned on.\r\nOpen Photos.\r\nWait and see if the pictures appear.\r\nGo check your settings because you aren't sure if they are syncing.\r\nLook at the iPhone and compare the thumbnails and try to guess if the sync is happening, complete, or not happening.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the Window menu, there should be an Activites window option.  Or there could be a progress indicator in the upper right of the Photos titlebar/toolbar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo idea what is happening behind the scenes.  Try to use Activity Monitor and photoslibraryd to decide if anything is happening.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPhotos: 1.3 (350.23.0)\r\nOS X: 10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEvery version of Photos so far.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
