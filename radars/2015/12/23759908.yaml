    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a template image in a UIImageView the tintColor should be applied. Instead, the template image is drawn in black.\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around in one of two ways:\r\n- Re-assign the tintColor to the image view. \r\n- Call tintColorDidChange() on the image view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Obtain or create a template image: black on white.\r\n2. Add the template image to Assets.xcassets.\r\n3. Set the image \"Render as\" field in the attributes inspector to \"Template Image\".\r\n3. Add an UIImageView to a view and set the image to the template image.\r\n4. Confirm that the tint color of the UIImageView is blue (the current default).\r\n4. Observe that it is rendered in black in the storyboard editor/interface builder.\r\n5. Run the app. The image will still be black.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should be drawn in the tint color because it is marked as a template image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tint color is ignored, initially.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be worked around by re-assigning the tintColor at runtime, or by calling tintColor\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1, Xcode 7.1.1 (7B1005)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached project demonstrates the problem and workarounds.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator or any iOS device."
