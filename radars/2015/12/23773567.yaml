    description: "Summary:\nTestFlight - No Significant Changes Checkbox should be at top\n\nThis is totally hidden, it should be a checkbox at the top that the person can see.\n\nRight now if I scan the page, I have no idea why I can’t click on Next button. It’s grayed out… I feel like I’ve filled out all the important information, yet I can’t continue.\n\nYou make this process incredibly frustrating because the UI is all over the place, and some buttons are hidden, or some checkboxes are hidden in a wall of things that I need to fill out…\n\nPlease move this to the top or bottom, it is not visible, and really is the only thing that prevents progression to the next screen.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Submit a bug to TestFlight\n2. Add a Build\n3. Fill out all the information\n…\n\n4. find the hidden checkbox that fills the entire screen… and choose a setting\n\n5. Click next \n\nExpected Results:\n\n1. Anything that prevents forward progression should be at the top… I shouldn’t have to read through an entire page to find one tiny checkbox.\n2. The checkbox takes up the entire screen (width wise) this makes it impossible to read. You should do this so the formatting is easier … use Safari’s Reader view as an example of what a good line length is.\n\nActual Results:\n1. Cannot find hidden checkbox to submit build.\n\nRegression:\n\nThe UI experience is awful.\n\nThis is trying to be “flat” and “iOS-like” but it falls down hard.\n\nIts unusable because the buttons to do actions are hidden on the right side, some are buttons, some are link buttons… not clear.\n\nSaving state is confusing, there is no feedback loops.\n\nYou hide settings (checkboxes) that span the entire screen and are very hard to read and find on a page.\n\n\n\nNotes:"
