    description: "Summary:\nIf you logged into OS X Server from Xcode, and then remove that login from Xcode and login to a different account on the OS X Server then the bots you create are created using the original login, whilst the bots listed in the reports Navigator in Xcode are the ones for the new login and you donâ€™t see your newly created bots.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Setup an OS X Server.\n2. Create two accounts on the server using the server admin application.\n3. Configure the server for use with Xcode and bots\n4. In Xcode login to the server using one of the two accounts you created in step 2. (Xcode Preferences, Accounts)\n5. Create a bot.\n6. Note that in the Reports navigator the bot appears.\n7. Remove the bot.\n8. In Xcode remove the login to the server created in step 4.\n9. In Xcode login to the server using the second of the two accounts you created in step 2.\n10. Create a bot.\n11. Note that in the reports navigator that the bot does not appear.\n12. Pull hair out.\n13. In Xcode remove the login to the server the created in step 9.\n14. In Xcode login to the server using the account you logged into the server in step 4.\n15. Notice that the bot you created in step 10 is now showing in the reports navigator.\n\nExpected Results:\nI expect that the bots I create when logged in to OS X Server in Xcode will be created with the account I am currently logged in to on OS X Server not the first account I used to login into OS X Server from Xcode.\n\nActual Results:\nThat bots appear to be created using the wrong account. The first account used to login into OS X Server with from Xcode not the one currently logged in with. \n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
