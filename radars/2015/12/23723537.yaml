    description: "XCUICoordinate is currently able to press over a coordinate, then drag to another coordinate and directly end the drag without waiting.\r\n\r\nWhile writing UI tests I had the need of holding the drag for a few moments after arriving to the destination coordinate (I am testing a drag&drop interaction over a scrollable view) so this enhancement to the API would help me test what I need.\r\n\r\nAs an idea of what I am proposing: \r\n\r\n- (void)pressForDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration thenDragToCoordinate:(XCUICoordinate *)otherCoordinate andHoldForDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration"
