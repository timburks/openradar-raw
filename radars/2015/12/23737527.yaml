    description: "Summary:\r\nGiven a UIVC that has a generic superclass, instantiation does not behave consistently. It fails the first time a particular class is instantiated, but works every time thereafter for a storyboard while it is in memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open either sample project\r\n2. Build + Run\r\n3. Tap one of the buttons\r\n4. A message will print to the console: \"2015-12-02 20:51:12.803 MoarTests[7286:1128104] Unknown class _TtC9MoarTests20PurpleViewController in Interface Builder file.\"\r\n5. Tap the same button a second time, and success message prints: \"Hello I am a <MoarTests.PurpleViewController: 0x7f994b5485c0>\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier to either fail consistently when dealing with generic view controllers or be able to handle them appropriately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view controller is not instantiated ONLY THE FIRST TIME instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier is called for that particular class. All calls thereafter work as expected.\r\n\r\nInstantiating one generic view controller subclass does not mean others will work. This happens on a class by class basis.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 & Xcode 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StoryboardGenericFail.zip' and 'StoryboardMultipleGenerics.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1G0R082n3q3c http://cl.ly/2h1P2g250w1j"
