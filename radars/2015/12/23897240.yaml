    description: "Summary:\r\nIn my application I have UINavigationController with UIPageViewController as the only view controller in the navigation stack. I use -[UIPageViewController setViewControllers:direction:animated:completion:] when I need to navigate forward. One of my view controller has UITextField that should have focus after presenting it on screen. I use standard way of doing this: -[UITextField becomeFirstResponder]. However it doesn't work on Xcode 7.2 with iOS 9.2. I see blue cursor when view controller appears on screen but it disappears immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached Xcode project\r\n2. Run it in iPhone Simulator with iOS 9.2\r\n3. Tap on \"Proceed to second screen\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText field with \"Subject under test\" placeholder should have focus\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText filed with \"Subject under test\" placeholder doesn't have focus\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo workaround this bug you have to use delayed call to -[UITextField becomeFirstResponder].\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS Simulator with iOS 9.x shipped with Xcode 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TextEditing.zip' was successfully uploaded."
