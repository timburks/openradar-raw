        Summary:
        S/MIME certificate from signed e-mails are not automatically saved/installed. OS X does this, making

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Receive an S/MIME signed e-mail
        2. Try to reply back to the user with an S/MIME encrypted e-mail

        Expected Results:
        Since Mail.app on iOS has already seen the S/MIME certificate in step 1, it should automatically know the certificate to use for S/MIME encryption.

        Actual Results:
        the S/MIME certificate seen in step 1 is not automatically saved and thus, encryption cannot be enabled.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        It would be really great if iOS matched OS X, to make S/MIME much easier to work with on iOS. OS X works great.
