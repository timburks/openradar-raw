    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Xcode presents a font picker in response to Edit > Format > Font > Show Fonts, the picker shows columns for family, typeface, and size, but not collections. Resizing the picker reveals the collections column, but the column disappears when resizing ends.\r\n\r\nThere is no apparent way to change the column widths, much less than drag the margin of the collection column into the browser view. The browser view does not scroll. Items in the action menu have their intended effects, but do not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nIf it happens that the selection in the hidden collection column does not match the selected text, there will be no font families to select. (I’m guessing; maybe families are never available.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new OS X/Application/Document+Swift+Unit+UI application and store it locally with a local Git repository.\r\n\r\n(Should not matter: Add a “data” section to Assets.xcassets, create a playground just to see what the value of kUTTypeRTF is, set the type of the new data asset to public.rtf. With the playground still selected, attempt to create the RTF file as below, as a sister to the project file, be told the placement is impossible. Select the project file in the navigator, and…)\r\n\r\nAdd an RTF file to an OS X project, using the File > New… assistant and selecting (approx) OS X > Resource > Rich Text File. (Per the previous paragraph, Xcode warns you’re about to overwrite the file created back then. Accept the overwrite.) It appears in the Project navigator and its content is displayed in the editor.\r\n\r\nType some text in. By eyeball, the text is 12-point Helvetica Regular.\r\n\r\nSelect the first line and seek to change it to 18-point Helvetica Bold, using the font picker. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSelect the appropriate font collection (if needed), pick Helvetica, then Bold, then 18. The selected text immediately changes appearance to match.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to do this, because (in my case) the font collection selected in the inaccessible collection list does not match the selected text. (Exposing the sample text shows the selected text’s font correctly.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEl Capitan 10.11.2 (15C50)\r\nXcode 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a duplicate of 23181461, filed a couple of months and four releases ago.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNoted for quite some time, I only just now got around to reporting it."
