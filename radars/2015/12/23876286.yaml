        Summary:
        When running the OS X 10.11.2 installer from the Mac App Store over an existing OS X partition, after a successful install has been completed, /var/db/receipts does not exist.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install OS X 10.11.1 or lower (including OS X 10.10.5).
        2. Download OS X El Capitan, 10.11.2 from the Mac App Store.
        3. Install OS X 10.11.2.
        4. Upon a successful installation, check the receipts database.

        Expected Results:
        The receipts database should contain software that has previously been installed.

        Actual Results:
        The package database will be empty.

        Regression:
        This issue does not occur when installing the OS X 10.11.2 delta update on top of OS X 10.11.1. It also did not occur in previous OS X releases.

        Notes:
        This is a huge issue as anything that looks at receipts to determine if something is installed or not will think that the software is no longer present and trigger a re-install of all managed software.
