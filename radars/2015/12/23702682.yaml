        Summary:

        When creating a second page in a Playground, the contents of the original page are moved to a new first page, automatically, and a new page is created. However, Xcode will display the same contents for both pages. Relaunching Xcode fixes the issue.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Create a new Playground inside a workspace
        2. Change the contents of the original page
        3. Choose “New Playground Page” from context menu

        Expected Results:

        The new first page contains the contents of the original page.

        Actual Results:

        The new first page contains the same contents as the new second page. The on-disk content is correct, though, so this is just a display issue.
