    description: "Summary:\r\nNeither “The Swift Programming Language” nor “Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C” have a table of contents when viewed in Xcode’s documentation viewer. This makes them nearly impossible to browse through.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Xcode documentation viewer\r\n2. Navigate to “Xcode 7.1 Documentation” —> “Swift” —> “Guides” —> “The Swift Programming Language (Swift 2.1)”\r\n3. Press the Table of Contents button in the documentation viewer toolbar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe table of contents is visible in the middle pane of the documentation window\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo table of contents\r\nScreenshot: https://www.evernote.com/l/AAW6zLkVghtGipBCdoR9iUpt_py3KQIJJwk\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt was also missing in 7.0 I believe. I remember it being there at some point.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to use the web page version (as long as one has an Internet connection)\r\n\r\n2016-05-02 Marked as a duplicate of 19911805"
