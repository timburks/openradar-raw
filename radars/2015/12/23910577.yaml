    description: "Summary:\r\nThe top of the iMessage sharing form (\"To\" label and text field) are cut off at the top when opened from an activityViewController while the status bar is not showing.\r\nThis was only noticeable in iBooks, because it is the only app I could find that allowed for sharing to iMessage while the status bar is not showing, but this will also be an issue in the app I am developing.\r\nThis was only ever found on iPad devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.Ensure iMessage is installed on an iPad\r\n2.Open a book in iBooks.\r\n3.Highlight and attempt to share text.\r\n4. Ensure the status bar is not showing.\r\n5. Select Messages from the activityViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe top of the form will not be cut off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe top of the form is cut off, making it hard to add message recipients.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1, iBooks 4.5\r\n\r\nNotes:"
