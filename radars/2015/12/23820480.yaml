    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I attempt to add my Xcode Server to my Developer Team, I receive an error message saying:  \"The selected team does not have a program membership that is eligible for this feature.\"\r\n\r\nI am an admin on an Enterprise Developer Account, and we have had and should have access to this feature of Xcode Server.\r\n\r\nPrior to Xcode 7.1, this was working.  But after I updated the OS X Server's instance of Xcode, and reconnected the Xcode Service, this broke.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start OS X Server\r\n2. Turn on Xcode Service\r\n3. Find locally installed version of Xcode (Version 7.1 or higher)\r\n4. When that successfully is configured, click on \"Add Team...\" next to the 'Developer Teams:\" label\r\n5. Click 'Add' when the prompt comes up confirming that you want to add this server to your team\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuccessful addition of the server to the Team.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEven though I see the the Computer Name added to the \"Xcode Server Enabled Computers\" table in Member Center -> Server's -> Xcode Server Enabled Computers, I am faced with a message that states: \"The selected team does not have a program membership that is eligible for this feature.\" and the Team does NOT show up on my Server app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 7.2 (7c68)\r\nOS X 10.11.2\r\nOS  Server: Version 5.0.15 (15S4033)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSearching around, it seems like there are quite a number of people experiencing this problem.  Any help you could provide would be helpful.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is on a Mac Mini running OS X 10.11.2, with OS X Server version 5.0.15, and Xcode 7.2."
