    description: "Summary:\r\nBasically what I ask is for a way to allow a Content Blocker to block/hide an element based on its innerHTML/text value.\r\n\r\nFor instance,\r\n<p>Text that I want to block</p>\r\nThere's no way of blocking this <p> element based on its text since CSS Selectors do not support innerHTML, only tag attributes.\r\n\r\nOne way to allow this, directly in the Content Blocker's blockerList.json:\r\n\"action\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"css-display-none\",\r\n    \"selector\": \"p[innerHTML*='Text that I want to block']\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nDoing this would open up a world of possibilites for Content Blockers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee description to get the idea.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe element would be blocked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently it's not possible."
