    description: "Summary:\r\nI can't scroll to see the oldest unused app in the multitasking view because SpringBoard crashes before I reach it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have lots of apps (I have 353 installed apps right now (I know it's bad))\r\n2. Go in multitasking view (double tap the home button)\r\n3. Swipe to see the oldest used app. No need to swipe really fast. It will crash at some point.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should scroll up to the oldest without any animation problem or crashes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animation glitches in a way that's pretty hard to describe (it seems to alternate really fast between two different animation \"frames\") and then SpringBoard crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn 9.0 and 9.1, what used to happen was a really weird animation glitch (but never a crash). Now I get both the weird animation glitch and a bonus SpringBoard crash !\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 (Model A1428) 64GB (12.7 GB available)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SpringBoard  2015-02-17, 10-33 PM.crash' was successfully uploaded."
