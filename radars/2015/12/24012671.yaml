        Summary:
        Google Maps has biking directions since more than 5 (!) years:
        https://googleblog.blogspot.co.at/2010/03/biking-directions-added-to-google-maps.html

        Apple Maps should have them as well, considering:
        * Google Maps has them since 5 years
        * Apple says it cares about the environment, so it should encourage using bikes as an alternative transportation method
        * Apple has the Apple Watch, which would be ideal for navigating while biking, but nope, Apple Maps has no biking directions
        * OpenStreetMaps has (most) of the data needed
        * Did I mention Google Maps has them since 5 years?
