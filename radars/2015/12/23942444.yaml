    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen resizing the dividing line between the primary and assistant editor, or the variables view and Console, snapping to the midpoint should be accompanied by Force Touch feedback in the Magic Trackpad or the trackpads build into the latest notebooks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project in Xcode.\r\n2. Configure the view so that you have the primary and assistant editor on screen at the same time.\r\n3. Drag the dividing line between the editors to resize them.\r\n4. Drag slowly near the middle and try to find the snap point where both panels are the same size.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf you are using a trackpad that has Force Touch, when the divider snaps to the midpoint, it should be accompanied by a light tap via the Force Touch feature in the trackpad.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no tap.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nnone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe tap-when-snapping feature is present when resizing the dividing line between two apps running in fullscreen split-screen mode under El Capitan (10.11.2). It also works when resizing a Finder windowâ€™s sidebar. It should work in Xcode as well."
