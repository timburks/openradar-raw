    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://23896366\n\nSummary:\r\nAccording to John McCall, spinlocks are illegal on iOS because iOS does not guarantee progress in the face of priority inversion. Greg Parker says there is a spinlock algorithm that works but requires a full word of storage. OSSpinLock is an int32_t, and is documented as being \"immune to most priority-inversion livelocks\", but when asked, Greg Parker says that OSSpinLock is not safe on iOS (unless all users have the same priority).\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20151214/000345.html\r\n\r\nThis comes as a surprise, because it's documented as being safe, and there's no other spinlock provided by the system. I've written code using spinlocks that use OSSpinLock under the assumption that it's safe, and I assume plenty of other people have done this too.\r\n\r\nTo that end, there really should be a spinlock implementation that's safe to use on iOS and is provided on the system and made available to third-party devs. By not providing such an implementation, third-party software will continue to use spinlocks that aren't safe (and for that matter I bet there's a fair amount of first-party software that's using OSSpinLock)."
