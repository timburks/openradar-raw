    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to log in to Application Loader with an account that is bound to more than one companies, the application loader just presents an error, telling the user that one should create separate accounts for each company. (See attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Application Loader\r\n2. Login with credentials that are linked to multiple iTunes Connect providers\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither I can choose between all apps of all providers or the application launcher asks what provider I want to use for this session.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error is presented, telling me that 'Your user account is attached to several iTunes providers. Create separate accounts for each provider before logging in.'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApplication Loader Version 3.3 (868)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried this with my Apple ID 'XXX'\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-12-08 at 2.48.24 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
