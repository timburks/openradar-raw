    description: "Summary:\r\nMy wife and I use the same use the same iCloud account on our iPhones for various reasons. We each have a unique phone number and associated to each phone.  iMessages work just fine between the two of us.  (Start new messages is set to the phone number) While the iCloud Apple ID is only checked on my phone. After both of us setup a new Apple watch, we could send digital touches to other people, but not to each other.  If I sent a touch to her, she wouldn't receive it.  I would immediately get a notification that I received a touch and it would play.  The sender was marked as my email address: xxxxxxx@icloud.com.\r\n\r\nDuring trouble shooting, I added my wife's email address to the iCloud account (though it isn't a new member of iCloud Family).  I then checked it as active on her phone.  On my phone, I unchecked it.  Now we receive each other's messages.  However, we now also get the same behavior where we also receive the message we just sent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using two iPhones and two Apple Watches, setup both phones to use the same iCloud account.\r\n2. Add a second email address by going to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive > Add Another Email...\r\n3. Make sure the new email is unchecked on the main account holder's phone and checked on the other.  Make sure the account holder's email is checked on the account holder's phone and unchecked on the other.\r\n4. Send a digital touch from one want to the other.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe touch would be sent and only received by the receiver.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe touch is received by both the receiver and sender.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
