        Summary:
        What does this mean?

        Why is the first email yellow, and the second is not?

        It’s not red… so it’s not an error, but what is the issue. Again no feedback… impossible to know whatthis means.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add new Tester to TestFlight
        2. Type in email

        Expected Results:
        1. No color highlighting for an email

        Actual Results:
        1. Email is highlighted in yellow	

        Regression:
        No idea … this site has changed a ton and isn’t consistent.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
