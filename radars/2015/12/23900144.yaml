    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using/building custom container view controllers (which follow similar pattern to that of UITabBarController) that have an array of child view controllers, it would be beneficial to have the opportunity of defining the parent/child relationship from Storyboards.\r\n\r\nThis might be implemented as a custom segue that is executed upon viewDidLoad, or perhaps by allowing the Container View logic to house an arbitrary number of child controllers per view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a container view controller that wants to display several child controllers (similar to UITabBarController)\r\n2. Use this container controller from a Storyboard\r\n3. Try to define the child relationships in the Storyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStoryboard allows defining parent child relationships between view controllers, similarly to how it works for UINavigationController (rootController) and UITabBarController (viewControllers).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStoryboard does not allow defining such a relationship, instead offering different segues that can't then be automatically triggered from viewDidLoad/loadView or similar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS SDK 9.2, Xcode 7.2 (7C68)"
