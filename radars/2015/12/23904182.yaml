        Summary:
        UITableView section background is white when visibleCells is called at the wrong time (namely in viewWillAppear:).
        This took me a while to track down. It’s a regression that appeared first on iOS 9.0. 8.3/8.4 work as expected (haven’t tested earlier versions but this never popped up so I assume is’s really a new bug in iOS 9)

        We update visible cells in viewWillAppear: instead of calling reloadData to improve performance and keep the selection intact.

        As soon as we call `visibleCells` or any of the related API (indexPathsForVisibleRows or cellForRowAtIndexPath) then under certain conditions UIKit reloads views: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/676832422902763520

        This was the original bug:

        This is how things should look:

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See example. Uncomment the call to visibleCells to work around the issue.

        Expected Results:
        The cell section background color should not change depending on when we query cells.
