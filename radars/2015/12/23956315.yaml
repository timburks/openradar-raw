    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UITabBar images and text titles are being displayed incorrectly in their normal (non-selected) state. The text titles are ignoring the UIControlState.Normal foreground color attributes and the images are being displayed as black, despite having the rendering mode set to UIImageRenderingMode.AlwaysOriginal. Both of these techniques worked correctly in tvOS 9.0.x, and both have stopped working in tvOS 9.1.\r\n\r\nThe relevant pieces of code are:\r\n\r\n\tself.tabBarItem.image = UIImage(named: \"Movies\")?.imageWithRenderingMode(.AlwaysOriginal)\r\n        self.tabBarItem.selectedImage = UIImage(named: \"MoviesFocused\")?.imageWithRenderingMode(.AlwaysOriginal)\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n\tUITabBarItem.appearance().setTitleTextAttributes([NSForegroundColorAttributeName: UIColor.grayColor()], forState: UIControlState.Normal)\r\n        UITabBarItem.appearance().setTitleTextAttributes([NSForegroundColorAttributeName: UIColor.cyanColor()], forState: UIControlState.Selected)\r\n\r\nA project archive is attached that demonstrates this issue. We have not been able to implement a method where the UITabBarItems are visible in their .Normal state with the UITabBar background set to black.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch attached app on device running tvOS 9.1\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected behavior is that the normal state is grey for the text and the original image for the image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nObserve normal state of tab bar items is black.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.1 (13U85)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTab bar displays correctly running on device with tvOS 9.0.x\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TabBarTestApp.zip' was successfully uploaded."
