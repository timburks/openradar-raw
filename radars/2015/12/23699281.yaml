    description: "Messages continues to send notifications even when the application is quit. It seems like the only ways to disable receiving messages from notifications are 1) turn on do not disturb 2) disable notifications entirely in System Preferences. Assuming I'd still like to receive other notifications, such as a chat client, I don't want to enable do not disturb. I also don't want to disable notifications entirely in System Preferences because I often want Messages notifications (when the app is open).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there was a way to configure notifications to not appear if Messages.app isn't open."
