    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the same vein of rdar://23737778, some kinds of lazy properties are not properly initialized when instantiating a concrete subclass of a type-generic UIVC.\r\n\r\nI've been able to reproduce issues with String and Dictionary, yet Array works fine.\r\n\r\nJust like in the other issue, the dictionary has technically been initialized and doing anything with it causes a crash:\r\n\r\n(lldb) p someValues\r\n([Int : String]) $R0 = {}\r\n(lldb) p someValues.count\r\nerror: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x18).\r\n\r\nA lazy string ends up empty but does not cause a crash:\r\n(lldb) po someString\r\n\"\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open example project\r\n2. Build & run\r\n3. Tap the button twice (due to rdar://23737527)\r\n4. Crash!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect lazy properties to be initialized appropriately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey are not initialized appropriately.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 & Xcode 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StoryboardLazyFail.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/2O003T063L3z"
