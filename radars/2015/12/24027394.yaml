    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new Low Power mode in iOS 9 is fantastic for squeezing extra time out of iPhone batteries. The main downside to the feature is that it is not easy to toggle on and off. To do so, one must navigate out of the current app and down the following path:\r\n\r\n    Settings app > Battery > Lower Power Mode on/off\r\n\r\nI've found myself using Low Power mode a lot when traveling, but I always forget to turn it off when I'm back on WiFi and/or have enough battery that I'm happy with disabling it. The auto-disable when the battery is fully is nice, but in this hectic world we don't always get a chance to fill the battery to full before moving about again.\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal to be able to enable and disable Low Power mode from the Control Center at will, regardless of where the user is. This would be especially beneficial to be able to toggle from the lock screen!\r\n\r\nI realize that Control Center is already packed with useful shortcuts and controls. I, personally, have never used the Timer or Calculator shortcuts and wonder if a user preference in Settings could be added to configure the things that appear in Control Center. I'll leave the decisions around how to organize things in CC up to you all. I'm sure you have analytics on which items are used the most/least and can make the right decisions for us all. Thanks!"
