(1070)’\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Invite new user to iTunes Connect. Give ‘App Manager’ role.\r\n2. Upload binary with new user’s credentials.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBinary is uploaded successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUpload failed and received error: ‘You must be an iTunes Connect Admin or Technical user in order to deliver content or metadata.
