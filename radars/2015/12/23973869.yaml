    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the system clock reverts to Jan 1st, 1970, all HTTPS communication fails until the clock is restored. An attacker could use a proxy to prevent the clock updating, thus the files on the hard drive are vulnerable indefinitely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable \"Set date and time automatically\" \r\n2. Set up Find my Mac\r\n3. Allow the battery to run out to the point where the system clock reverts to 1970\r\n4. Lock the Mac with a passcode using iCloud.com\r\n5. Charge the Mac and power it on\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Mac should be locked with a passcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Mac is not locked.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.5"
