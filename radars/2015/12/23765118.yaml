    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting attributed text on a UITextView tap targets will become misaligned with their associated text when hyphenation is also turned on. It doesn't matter if hyphenation is enabled in an NSParagraphStyle attribute or in the NSLayoutManager associated with the UITextView. The visual styles associated with the text are correct, but when a link is encountered after several lines of hyphenation the touch target to enable the link is aligned several characters before the actual link text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app that uses a UITextView\r\n2. Assign an NSAttributedString to the UITextView using -[UITextView setAttributedText]. The string should be hyphenated (using NSParagraphStyle) and also contain links (using NSLinkAttributeName).\r\n3. Run the app\r\n4. Try to tap a link after several lines of hyphenation. The more lines that are hyphenated, the further the tap target will be from the actual link text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTap targets should remain aligned with their associated text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTap targets become misaligned from their associated text, which makes them almost impossible to tap (you have to guess where the tap target is).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 [13B143]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA sample project is attached that shows the problem. All of the links (look for the word \"Space\") are misaligned.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator, iPhone 6 Plus 64 GB AT&T (using WiFi)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nProject included as zip, also available at https://github.com/adamschlag/LinkBug"
