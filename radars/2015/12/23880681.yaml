        Summary:
        No matter how lousy my network is, I'll always have 5 bars in the menu bar.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Join a network which has a high noise to signal ratio.

        Expected Results:
        Not to see 5 bars, because you practically can't use this network.

        Actual Results:
        5 bars.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        I think what's happening is that the number of bars is determined by the signal strength, so all networks look great when scanning them (5 bars!), but when you join them, if there is a lot of noise on the connection, the number of bars should change (but it doesn't), thus leaving me with 5 bars of connection but zero connectivity, which is like totally uncool man.
