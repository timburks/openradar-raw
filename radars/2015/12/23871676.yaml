    description: "Summary:\n\n9.2 introduces edge swipe functionality when SFViewController is presented with the default presentation style. It does not, however, work properly when being presented from a full screen app —  a view controller that returns true from prefersStatusBarHidden() — when there is an active personal hotspot connection or an active call. \n\nSpecifically, the SFSafariViewController is presented with an incorrectly-sized Navigation Bar and it corrupts the size of the view of the view controller that it was presented from after being dismissed.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Clone the sample project at https://source.ind.ie/aral/sfsafariviewcontroller-extended-status-bar-bug that isolates and demonstrates the bug.\n2. Turn on Personal Hotspot and ensure that there’s an active connection (or make sure there’s an active phone call) or simulate one.\n3. Run the project and tap the button to display the SFSafariViewController.\n4. Dismiss the SFSafariViewController\n\nExpected Results:\n\nIt should display without any artefacts and, on dismissal, should return to exactly the view configuration it was presented from.\n\nActual Results:\n\nIn Step 3: It displays a Navigation Bar with incorrect height.\n\nIn Step 4: It corrupts the size of the view that was present.\n\nRegression:\n\n* Tested on iPhone 6, iOS 9.2.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe linked to project isolates and reproduces the issue."
