        Summary:
        The Alex voice doesn’t correctly pronounce the borrowed Spanish word “Molinillo”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Terminal.app.
        2. Run this command:

            say Molinillo

        Expected Results:
        The Alex voice pronounces it in a somewhat correct way.

        Actual Results:
        The pronunciation sounds almost exactly the same as the way Alex pronounces “Molly Nillo” - it sounds like two words, and very American. The first “i” should be like the “i” in “artifact” instead of an “ee” sound, and the “nillo” part of the word should be more like “nee-yo”. (Ask a Spanish-speaking person, which I am not, for the correct pronunciation.)
