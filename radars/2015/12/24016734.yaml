    description: "Summary:\r\nThe longer Xcode has been open, the choppier scrolling in the source code editor gets.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project in Xcode.\r\n2. Work on the project for, say, 5 hours over the course of a day.\r\n3. Scroll in the source editor (no fancy panels or assistants open - just the project navigator next to the code editor, with the Variables View and Debugger visible at the bottom).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScrolling is as smooth as it was when Xcode is first launched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScrolling is choppy. I forgot to check it with the Quartz Debug frame meter, but it looks like it’s around 15 fps. Relaunching Xcode always restores scrolling performance.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown, but it feels like this is new as of Xcode 6 or 7. It’s hard to test because it takes so long to reproduce.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve attached two Activity Monitor samples of Xcode. One is of scrolling in the editor when the issue was reproducing. Immediately after recording that sample, I relaunched Xcode, confirmed that scrolling was smooth again, and recorded another sample.\r\n\r\nI have several plugins installed via Alcatraz. They should be visible in the attached samples. I haven’t tested whether any of them is causing this issue, since it would likely take days of careful testing to do a binary search to see if one of them is causing the issue, and I’d rather not disable them all at once because they help me work faster.\r\n\r\nScrolling samples also posted to http://cl.ly/eB3F"
