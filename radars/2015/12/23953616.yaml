    description: "Summary:\nI was at my grandparents who have now started using a MacBook. Why can’t I disable the fullscreen mode? I can’t advise them to click the green button for windows. If one enters full screen mode, there is NO indiciation to the user where the hell his menubar and his dock went, or how he could open them again to close the program, for that matter. Hiding UI for novice users is just bad. How would they know that „they have to move the mouse up and wait a moment at the edge of the screen so the UI appears“?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nPress green button on app, wonder where your UI goes or how you close the program\n\nExpected Results:\nShow the users a hint of where the UI went or overhaul the UI so menubar and maybe dock aren’t hidden completely OR provide me with an easy system prefs setting so I can disable that for people like my grandparents. It essentially boils down to there not being a „home button“ on OS X. With a home button, that works (aka iOS), but on Mac OS? \n\nActual Results:\nNo UI user-visible of how to close his window or access the dock\n\nRegression:\nI’m not sure at which version of OS X fullscreen mode was introduced. ;-)\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
