    description: "Summary:\r\nActivity.app on my iPhone (iOS 9.2) did not sync some activity data (calories) that was recorded by my Apple Watch, causing me to lose my 211-day activity streak. This is probably related to upgrading to watchOS 2.1, which I did on the day that this happened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThese steps are probably not a 100% reliable way of reproducing this issue, but this is what I did:\r\n1. I knew that upgrading to watchOS 2.1 could potentially be problematic for my activity data, so I wanted to be careful about it. So before I started the upgrade, I made sure that I filled all three activity rings on my Apple Watch. My daily calorie goal is 1100 calories and I just reached this a few minutes before midnight. This was on December 9, 2015. I have not enabled notifications for reaching an activity goal, but I distinctly remember that I completed all rings (as I have for 211 days in a row).\r\n2. I did *not* check that all activity data had made it to Activity.app on my iPhone at that moment. In hindsight, I should have probably done that.\r\n3. I then performed the upgrade process to watchOS 2.1 (from 2.0). I can't remember exactly whether this was before midnight or shortly after on that day. It's safe to assume that the upgrade finished (and the watch rebooted) after midnight. My iPhone 6s was already on iOS 9.2 at the time.\r\n4. I did *not* check Activity.app on the iPhone right after the upgrade. I forgot about the whole thing for a few days.\r\n5. On December 12, I launched Activity.app on my iPhone and noticed that it showed I had not reached my activity goal for December 9 and therefore broken my 211-day streak. The calorie counter for that day was at 964 of 1100 (see attached screenshot).\r\n6. I started Health.app on the iPhone to double check the values. In Health.app, the recorded total for Active Calories on December 9, 2015 is 1113.05 calories (see attached screenshot)! This matches the actual data I saw on my watch.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nActivity.app should show the same values as Health.app. It is unacceptable that some data does not sync over (presumably because of a software upgrade).\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThere does not seem to be any way for end users to force a resync of Activity.app with the Health database. I tried killing and relaunching Activity.app, and rebooting the iPhone, several times to force Activity.app to re-sync with the Health database, but it is still reporting 964 calories.\r\nI also tried adding 150 calories manually to the Active Calories category directly in Health.app.app (Active Energy > Add Data Point) in the hope that Activity.app would see this new value and add it to its total (964 + 150 > 1100). But it doesn't do that.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand that bugs happen, and that syncing is very hard. But the activity data (and the associated achievements) are very valuable and personal to me (and many other users, as I've learned when I shared this problem on Twitter). If there is even a slight chance that a fuckup like this can occur, there should be a way for end users to tell Activity.app to reimport the data from the Health database and update achievements retroactively."
