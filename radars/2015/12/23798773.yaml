    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode picks a XC* wildcard profile when signing apps for Mac App Store distribution even so an App specific profile exists. If the XC* wildcard contains entitlements not corresponding to the uploaded app, the binary is rejected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Prepare to upload app to Mac App Store\r\n2. After choosing the signing identity binary and entitlements are shown\r\n3. Check provisioning profile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be the created profile\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXC* is used\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1.1 on 10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems to be solvable by deleting the wildcard and manually creating and downloading the app provisioning profile."
