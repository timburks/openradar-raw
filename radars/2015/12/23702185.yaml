        Summary:
        The class reference for subclasses of NSControl does not always state when they send their action message.

        For example, NSButton[1] states that it is a subclass of NSControl and that
        “An NSButton object sends an action message to a target object, such as a view controller, when the button is clicked.”

        NSDatePicker[2] declares that it is a subclass of NSControl but omits information about its action:
        “NSDatePicker is a subclass of NSControl that provides a user interface for displaying and editing an NSDate object.”

        NSBrowser[3] only references NSControl in the “Inherits from” tree, and information about its action can only be inferred from reading the documentation of the `sendsActionOnArrowKeys` property, or by searching the internet for the original NeXT documentation[4].
