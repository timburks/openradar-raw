        Summary:
        When the Touch ID dialog is presented and there was is a keyboard visible in the app invoking Touch ID, sometimes the keyboard becomes invisible, although it’s still up. Any inputAccessoryView stays hidden.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Ensure that the keyboard is visible and up
        2. Present Touch ID using LAContext

        Expected Results:
        The Touch ID dialog is presented on top of the app invoking it and the keyboard stays visible.

        Actual Results:
        The keyboard disappears, although it’s still reported as being up. Any inputAccessoryView attached to the keyboard stays visible, resulting in a funny situation where there is a floating inputAccessoryVIew behind the Touch ID dialog.

        Regression:
        Didn’t seem to happen in iOS8.

        Notes:
        Happens about 50% of the time and seems timing related. In the attached screenshot, you can see a line floating behind the Touch ID dialog: this is actually an inputAccessoryView that’s still visible, while the keyboard has gone missing in action. No UIKeyboardDidHideNotification is received.

        If the Touch ID dialog is dismissed, the keyboard instantly becomes visible again, without any keyboard notification firing.
