    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22993940\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSurprise: something else is broken!\r\nIn this episode of “What’s broken in Appleland?” we’ll cover the mysterious case of building AppleTV frameworks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a project (I recommend googling for StackOverflow posts that explain how to do this)\r\n- Add an AppleTV framework target.\r\n- Compile target in Release mode from the command line (using Carthage, for example).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Build succeeds, although this .framework is completely useless (see rdar://22967941 for more details)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- SURPRISE!! It doesn’t. Xcode spits out tons of errors like:\r\n  - /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/include/sys/cdefs.h:707:2: error: Unsupported architecture\r\n#error Unsupported architecture\r\n  - /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/include/_types.h:42:9: error: unknown type name '__uint32_t'\r\ntypedef __uint32_t      __darwin_wctype_t;\r\n  - ld: warning: Auto-Linking supplied '/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/lib/libobjc.dylib', file was built for x86_64 which is not the architecture being linked (arm64): /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/AppleTVSimulator9.0.sdk/usr/lib/libobjc.dylib\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked in beta 2… (though everything that was previously broken is still broken!)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have no idea if this is a known issue because at the time of this writing the release notes have not been published yet."
