    description: "On Friday, December 4, 2015 at 2pm EST (11am PST), any application installed from our MDM to display the following message:\r\n\r\nUntrusted Enterprise Developer\r\n“iPhone Distribution: xxxxxxxx” has not been trusted on this iPod. Until this developer has been trusted, their enterprise apps will not be available for use.\r\n\r\nThis app is installed from an MDM which mean that we don’t require explicit user trust. From WWDC2015 Session 301 (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-301/)\r\n\r\n> Apps installed via MDM do not require explicit user trust\r\n\r\nThis worked great until the issue Friday. A quick search on twitter and the developer forums showed many other people with this issue and presumed the Enterprise Certificate Validation Services were unavailable (https://ppq.apple.com was unavailable for us).\r\n\r\nThis issue was resolved for us around 7pm EST (4pm PST), around 5 hours later. During this time, all of Apple’s system statuses appeared green (https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/). We contacted Apple and it took a while to heard a confirmation that there were issue, but we never heard back when they were resolved (Apple Support Case Number XXXXXXXX).\r\n\r\nThe reality is web server go down and there are network issues that may be beyond Apple’s control, but we need better communication from Apple when these issues arise. It took us 30 minutes before we could figure out if the issue was even with us or Apple. And then a further 4 1/2 hours before the issues were resolved but not confirmation.\r\n\r\nWe would like:\r\n- Enterprise Services Status on the System Status Dashboard.\r\n- Companies enrolled in the Apple Developer Enterprise Program to be emailed when enterprise services are unreachable with\r\n  - a reason why (if known)\r\n  - who is affected (if known)\r\n  - estimated time fixed (if known)\r\n  - An Apple contact with more information.\r\n- Companies enrolled in the Apple Developer Enterprise Program to be emailed when enterprise services that were previously unreachable are now available."
