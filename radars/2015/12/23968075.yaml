        Summary:
        There is no way to install a newer incoming S/MIME certificate (manually), if there is still an older (expired!) certificate installed. There is no way to see this: the expired certificate doesn’t show up in the Profiles item in Settings and tapping on the 'Install' button for the new certificate doesn’t do anything.

        The only way to notice that an older certificate is installexd is to go to an older e-mail from that sender, tap on the certificate and see that there is a "Remove" button to uninstall the old, expired certificate.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Receive an S/MIME signed e-mail from someone
        2. Install the certificate
        3. Wait until the certificate expires (e.g. a year(
        4. Get a new certificate from the same person
        5. Try to install it by tapping the 'Install' button

        Expected Results:
        The new certificate installs properly and the 'Install' button changes in a 'Remove' button.

        Actual Results:
        Tapping the install button does nothing: the new certificate is not installed nor is a error shown.

        Regression:
