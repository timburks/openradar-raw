        Summary:
        View controller presented with performSegue is never deallocated if the transition is cancelled

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a modal segue between two view controllers in a storyboard
        2. Create a pan gesture recogniser that performs that segue using a custom animation controller and an interaction controller
        3. When the gesture recogniser ends call cancelInteractiveTransition on the interaction controller

        Expected Results:
        The transition is cancelled and the view controller that was created is released and deallocated

        Actual Results:
        The transition is cancelled but the presented view controller is retained. Repeated calls to the segue continue to create new instances of the view controller that are never released.

        Regression:
        iOS 9.1 on device and in simulator
