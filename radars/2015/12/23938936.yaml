        Summary:
        When you ask for directions to a place, and there are two places whose names start the same, and are at the same or similar addresses, it’s impossible to tell them apart on a Watch.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Be in the Boston/Cambridge area.
        2. Have an Apple Watch 42mm running watchOS 2.1 (13S661) set to American English (no Siri customizations that I know of).
        3. Invoke Siri by holding the Digital Crown.
        4. Say “walking directions to Cambridgeside Galleria”
        5. Wait for results.

        Expected Results:
        Watch shows only one result, or else it unambiguously differentiates between similar results.

        Actual Results:
        Watch shows results for both Gambrdigeside Galleria and Cambridgeside Galleria Parking Garage. The Watch’s screen is so small that all you can see of the names is “Cambridgeside G…” (I believe I have the system font size set to default.) The other confusing thing is that their addresses are similar. Cambridgeside Galleria is located at 100 Cambridgeside Pl Unit 315, while the parking garage is located at just plain 100 Cambridgeside Pl, with no Unit number. On the Watch, these both display as “100 Cambridgesi…”. On the attached Watch screenshot, they appear to be the same distance apart, but on the attached iPhone screenshot, which was taken at a slightly different location, the Galleria is 0.1 mi away, and the Parking Garage is 0.2 mi away, which just makes things slightly more confusing, because in cases like that, it looks even more like they are two different locations, and you might be in danger of picking the wrong one.

        Regression:
        unknown
