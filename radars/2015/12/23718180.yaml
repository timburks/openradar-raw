        Summary:
        The entire Authorization Services API is not allowed within a sandboxed app. This completely prevents using something like SFAuthorizationView to add an administrative lock to app-level rights.

        In this specific instance I am trying to allow an administrator to lock the editing portions of an app from normal users.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to use any authorization function in a sandboxed app.

        Expected Results:
        A successful result as long as there is a valid entitlement set.

        Actual Results:
        Everything returns an access denied or failure error.

        Regression:
        This always occurs in the app sandbox.

        Notes:
        There is no workaround.
