        This is a follow-up of rdar://23685683 which was misunderstood.

        The bug is about the dialog that comes when a new update is available for iOS devices:
        https://twitter.com/steipete/status/671263200655093760

        The bug is that the “Do not ask me again” checkbox is ignored. The dialog is displayed every time the device is plugged into the Mac. There is no difference if Cancel is pressed with a checked box or without.

        The response I got was this:

        >The preference is designed to be per-device and per-software version, so that checking the checkbox will suppress the notification only for the currently available update and not for future updates.

        Yes. This would be perfect. However that's not what is happening. The dialog appears every single time I plug in my Mac. I always check the box and press cancel. I assume that the logic that should save that preference just does not work, or it is only implemented if I do not choose “Cancel”.

        If iTunes can be fixed in a way that it works as described in the Apple Developer Relations response to the previous radar, I’d be delighted.
