    description: "Summary:\r\nUICollectionView self-sizing cells not rendering properly after using UICollectionFlowLayout's invalidateLayout and estimatedItemSize methods.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you try to override preferredLayoutAttributesFittingAttributes to manually the right frame.x position is completely ignored. \r\n\r\nNo combination of constraints that I could find would solve the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the app in iPad Portrait Mode.\r\n2. Scroll the UICollectionView down to set the first cells not visible.\r\n3. With a swipe from the right edge of the screen, invoke Split Screen to pick a secondary app (i.e. Calendar). App should be in split-screen multitasking.\r\n4. App now show a single row of cells.\r\n5. Scroll to top.\r\n\r\nAnimation: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4z0d0wcb8piuqtu/Animation.gif?dl=0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFirst UICollectionViewCell is rendered in the same position as the other cells.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFirst UICollectionViewCell is not rendered in the right position.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UICollectionViewResizingCells.zip' was successfully uploaded."
