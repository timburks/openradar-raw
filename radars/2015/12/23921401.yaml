        Summary:
        If you ask Alex to say “If you have a sec swing by where the web team is sitting”, it will sound like “If you have a sex swing by where the web team is sitting”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Terminal, type “say If you have a sec swing by where the web team is sitting” and press Return. (This bug actually affected someone reading their Slack messages with the screen reader, but this is a cleaner way to test it.)

        Expected Results:
        The words sound unambiguously like “If you have a sec swing by where the web team is sitting”

        Actual Results:
        The words sound much more like “If you have a sex swing by where the web team is sitting”

        Regression:
        unknown

        Notes:
        Alex doesn’t do this if you use a shorter phrase. For example, `say if you have a sec swing by` puts much more of a gap between “sec” and “swing” than when you use the full phrase.

        Also, if you use a comma in the full phrase, Alex pronounces it correctly: `say If you have a sec, swing by where the web team is sitting` (but who has time for punctuation these days?).

        Output of `say [foo] -o output.aiff` attached for posterity, and also uploaded to http://cl.ly/e6UE
