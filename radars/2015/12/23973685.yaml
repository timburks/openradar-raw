    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 7.1.1 and earlier, passing -sdk iphonesimulator to xcodebuild would imply a suitable destination. In Xcode 7.2, this is no longer the case and the inferred destination is a generic iOS device rather than a simulator.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to imagine a case where this would be desired behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project with Xcode 7.1.1 or earlier.\r\n2. With Xcode 7.1.1 or earlier selected through xcode-select or DEVELOPER_DIR, build it from the command line: xcodebuild -configuration Release -scheme <scheme> -sdk iphonesimulator clean build\r\n3. Run the same build with Xcode 7.2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build should succeed in both cases.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcodebuild infers a valid SDK root (iphonesimulator9.2) and sets -isysroot to -isysroot $DEVELOPER_DIR/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator9.2.sdk. However, it selects architectures armv7 and arm64, and puts $DEVELOPER_DIR/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin in $PATH.\r\n\r\nThis results in the compiler trying to use the simulator version of sys/cdefs.h to build with armv7 and arm64 architectures, which produces errors like:\r\n\r\nIn file included from <module-includes>:1:\r\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator9.2.sdk/usr/include/sys/cdefs.h:707:2: error: Unsupported architecture\r\n#error Unsupported architecture\r\n ^\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached archive contains:\r\n* A sample project (just a Single View App template with the deployment target lowered to 9.0)\r\n* A script to run test builds consistently and gather versioned logs\r\n* Example output from Xcode 7.1.1 and 7.2.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens consistently in all tested configurations involving Xcode 7.2."
