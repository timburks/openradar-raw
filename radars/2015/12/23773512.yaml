        Summary:
        I am trying to send out a new build to replace the expired build and it won’t let me click on Next!

        All the textboxes are filled… how many bugs do I have to run into with using iTunesConnect and TestFlight?

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Submit Build
        2. Add Build to External Testing
        3. Fill out testing information

        Expected Results:

        Next Button should be clickable

        Actual Results:
        Next Button is grayed out.

        Regression:

        I can’t send build to testers with a button I can’t click on.
