    description: "There are some cases where one view controller should be able to disallow rotation. Specifically, when that view controller uses the gyroscope for user interaction.\r\n\r\nWhen opting into split-screen multitasking, that ability is taken away. It should be made available when the app is fullscreen / not sharing with any other apps.\r\n\r\nUn-rotating a view as a workaround is not sufficient. During the rotation animation user touch interaction is disabled, and again, there are cases where orientation should stay locked while a user moves the device for motion interaction.\r\n\r\nThe 'App Requires Fullscreen' option is no good, since it means we cannot participate in split-screen multitasking.\r\n\r\nAsking the user to lock the entire device for one view controller only is a poor, clunky workaround that interferes with all other apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an app that does not 'Require Fullscreen.' Now you cannot prevent rotation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHave some way to prevent rotation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo way to prevent rotation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand that rotation must be enabled when sharing the screen with other apps. However when an app is fullscreen, it should retain the ability to prevent rotation"
