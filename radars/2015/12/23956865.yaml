    description: "Summary:\r\nThe modal presentation stack can end up in the wrong order after adapting to a different presentation style when a custom presentation controller is involved in the modal presentation stack.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFollow these steps using an iPad that supports spit view.\r\n\r\n1) Present a modal view controller with a custom presentation controller\r\n2) Present a modal view controller with a modal presentation style of `UIModalPresentationFormSheet` (no custom presentation controller needed)\r\n3) Present a modal view controller (no custom presentation controller needed)\r\n4) Adapt to/from full screen to force the form sheet to adapt presentation styles\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the view controllers to still be presented in order. The visible order should be:\r\n\r\n1) custom presentation controller\r\n2) form sheet\r\n3) standard view controller\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe visible order is wrong. It is:\r\n\r\n1) custom presentation controller\r\n2) standard view controller\r\n3) form sheet\r\n\r\nThis can leave the application in an unrecoverable state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis appears to happen with any standard adaptivity. For example, using a popover instead of a form sheet causes the exact same issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 (device or simulator)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sad-modal.zip' and 'sad-modal.mov' were successfully uploaded."
