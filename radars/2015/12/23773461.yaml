        Summary:
        TestFlight Beta Information asks for “What to Test”

        This text is not sent to beta testers, only the app description is sent.

        Why is this information not sent to beta testers? They can’t test what I type in the box…

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Submit testflight build
        2. Fill out new “What to Test” text box
        3. Send beta to beta testers

        Expected Results:

        1. Email should show “What to Test”
        2. TestFlight app should show “What to Test”

        Actual Results:

        “What to Test” is never sent to anyone… only lives in iTunesConnect.

        Only the Description is sent to beta testers, so I don’t get the point…

        Regression:
