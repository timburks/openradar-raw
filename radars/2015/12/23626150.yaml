    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery couple weeks or so all my devices seem to have problems both with AirPlay (finding speakers when they are switched on) or Bonjour (Remote app on iPhone can't see my Mac Mini which is playing music).\r\nRestarting the base station always fixes the issues. What kind of diagnostic information do you need from me to figure out why my devices can't all get along? I have a newer base station, new 6S, fairly new Mac Mini running 10.10 so I assume it isn't the issue where some older device is poisoning the network.\r\nI can run whatever apps you'd like or run things in Terminal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Just use all my devices as one would. Play music daily. Use AirPlay speakers, use my Mac Mini via Screen Sharing to control iTunes.\r\n2. At some point turning on the speakers will no longer play music through them.\r\n3. At some point Remote app on iOS will no longer show the Mac Mini even though I can see iTunes running on it and still playing out the speakers attached to it.\r\n4. Open Airport Utility and select Restart Base Station\r\n5. When it comes back up again suddenly all my AirPlay and Bonjour issues are gone.\r\n6. Wait another couple weeks though and they'll all be back.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI've invested plenty of money to have things 'just work'. It is frustrating when they randomly fail. Oh I have to run out for awhile. Let me switch off the music via Remote. Oh wait, doesn't show up. Let me go find my laptop and use Screen Sharing. Sigh.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6S, iOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\nMac Mini, 2010, 10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAirport Base Station, new(est) model? Firmware 7.7.3"
