    description: "Left and right preview actions like Mail app will be handy.\r\n\r\nBesides, since you offer them in Mail app, many users ask for them in 3rd-party apps. But unfortunately we can not offer them. It is quite hard to explain to them. Even if at last they understand and they still feel disappointed."
