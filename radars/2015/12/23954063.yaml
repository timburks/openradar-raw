        Summary:
        When receiving an S/MIME signed or encrypted e-mail, Mail doesnâ€™t show any status icon if the e-mail is signed and/or encrypted. Mail on IOS does show a verified icon and/or padlock icon when needed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Receive an S/MIME signed e-mail

        Expected Results:
        There is a verification icon somewhere in the Mail preview pane/window

        Actual Results:
        There is no indication that the e-mail is S/MIME signed or encryption.

        Regression:
        This used to work fine on OSX Mavericks.

        Notes:
        This makes using S/MIME pretty pointless on OSX.
