    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a playground in a workspace that also has a custom framework, you can import the framework in the main playground, but if you add a new Swift file to the playground, you can’t import the framework from it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a workspace with a playground and an external framework (see attached sample project).\r\n2. Create a new Swift source file in the playground.\r\n3. Try to import the framework in the new Swift source file you created in step 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can import and use the framework’s module.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n“No such module ‘FRAMEWORK_NAME’”\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached workspace. Try to import MD5Digest into “Day4.swift”."
