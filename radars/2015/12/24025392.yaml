    description: "Summary:\r\nI have UICollectionView where each cell contains AVPlayerLayer and play video, but if on the screen more then 16 cells appears AVPlayerLayer becomes transparent and didn't play anything.\r\n\r\nAlso AVPlayer's @\"status\" observer didn't report about error I got AVPlayerStatusReadyToPlay in observer callback\r\n\r\nThis problem reproduces only on device (on Simulator over 30 AVPlayer instances works simultaneously)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip 8VideoConcept.zip and open in Xcode\r\n2. Run application on real device\r\n3. After delay 3-5 sec you will see that not all players play video\r\n4. You will observe picture like on attached screenshot-bug.png\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is possible several expected results:\r\n1. report AVPlayerStatusFailed or AVPlayerItemStatusUnknown in @\"status\" observer (currently AVPlayer report status AVPlayerStatusReadyToPlay)\r\nor\r\n2. way to configure max AVPlayer instances which can play at the same time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAVPlayer hung, AVPlayerLayer is transparent\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1, iOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nJust look at attached 8VideoConcept.zip, most interesting parts\r\nVideoCollectionViewCell.m\r\nDataViewController.m\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th Gen. (A1421), iPad Air (A1474), iPad 4 Gen. (A1416)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'8VideoConcept.zip' and 'screenshot-bug.png' were successfully uploaded"
