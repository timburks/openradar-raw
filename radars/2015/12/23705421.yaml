    description: "[Want to discuss? Get in touch with me @jamesreggio.]\r\n\r\nWhen you navigate to another app from an instance of SFSafariViewController, an iOS status bar button should appear that reads 'Back to [App Name]'. The absence of this button breaks with iOS 9 conventions and increases the likelihood that the user will never return to the host app, which is highly undesirable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a website in SFSafariViewController.\r\n2. Tap the Safari icon in the toolbar to open the page in Mobile Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA 'Back to [App Name]' button appears in the status bar at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo button appears in the status bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 on iOS 9.1 (13B143)"
