        Summary:
        Cannot Add TestFlight Beta Tester - Save Button Grayed Out

        The save button is grayed out and will not let me add a new beta tester.

        The entire UI is buggy as hell, and the flow is awful.

        I added a new tester (who was previously a tester that I removed) because they didn’t get my invite email (or is was lost) and you don’t provide a way to resend an invite email to a tester.

        Please fix the UI so that I can invite new beta testers… this two step process is terrible. Please change is so that I can add in one step.

        When I click “+” and add a new tester, they should be added … I should not have to search for a little “Save” button the right side of the screen to confirm. That makes no sense.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to External Testing
        2. + add new tester
        3. add email/name/last
        4. Click Add (not added yet!)
        5. Try to click save (grayed out…)

        Expected Results:

        Save should not be grayed out.

        Actual Results:
        Save is grayed out, I cannot add new testers to my build.

        Regression:

        The new TestFlight from Apple is a huge regression on the usability of beta testing with a small team, for personal testing on a group of devices, and for trying to quickly add new testers.

        There are too many button clicks, too many screens to navigation, too many hidden buttons, too many dialogs to confirm.

        The full screen web spans are terrible to read, and the most important settings are halfway down a page, instead of being at the top.

        Please use UserTesting.com to improve the experience. This is so frustrating to use. Bugs at every step of the process. Do you use this site?
