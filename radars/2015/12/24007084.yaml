    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom time to time, when the computer boots, otherbsd process fails to launch login items (at least, but not necessarily limited to, the ones added with ServiceManagement's SMLoginItemSetEnabled() function) and they're disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Restart computer, so login items will be launched.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\notherbsd process launches all login items.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll login items fail to be launched with error code 119 and they're disabled. The file /var/log/system.log contains messages from \"otherbsd\" process stating that it couldn't submit the login items (see attached log) reporting error code 119.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.2 (15C50), 10.10.3 (14D136), possibly all intermediate versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSearching the internet, you can find plenty of system log dumps with the same error, mostly from users posting the logs because of other problems, so this issue seems to be widespread.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI couldn't find any circumstance or configuration to make it consistently fail or succeed.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nHere's the relevant part of the uploaded log file\r\n\r\n12/24/15 7:02:26.872 AM\tcom.apple.xpc.launchd[1]\t(com.apple.xpc.launchd.user.501.100005.Aqua) Could not import service from caller: caller = otherbsd.203, service = com.apple.photostream-agent, error = 119: Service is disabled\r\n12/24/15 7:02:26.873 AM\totherbsd[203]\tCould not submit LoginItem job com.apple.photostream-agent: 119: Service is disabled"
