    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen swiping back from Safari View Controller in iOS 9.2, if the presenting controller has a different preferredStatusBarStyle, it will deallocate improperly and cause the entire app to stop responding. Although buttons and cells will show the selected state change and animate, none actually perform their actions properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable the Info.plist key \"View-controlled based status bar appearance\"\r\n2. Implement a view controller which presents Safari View Controller\r\n3. Implement the preferredStatusBarStyle method with UIStatusBarStyleLightContent in that view controller\r\n4. Swipe back to dismiss the Safari View Controller and attempt to interact with the app â€” occasionally this takes 2 attempts to occur, such as with an example project: https://github.com/insanj/SafariSwipeReproducer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNormal app functionality. Nothing works after swiping back Safari View Controller, forcing every user to kill and relaunch the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnresponsive app. Nothing launches or pushes or presents. Although selection state animates (touches work fine), nothing else does.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 [13C75]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI made an example project to demonstrate this bug: https://github.com/insanj/SafariSwipeReproducer\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nFound on all simulators and all iOS 9.2 Devices"
