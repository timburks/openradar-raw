    description: "Title:\r\nWCSession should be usable from a Today Extension\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nI'd like to synchronise information between a Today Extension and a WatchOS2 glance, but this isn't possible because the Watch is only paired with the containing app, not with its extensions.\r\n\r\nI can get [WCSession defaultSession], but then session.paired is NO.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nIn my Today Extension, I can successfully get [WCSession defaultSession], but [session isPaired] returns NO.\r\n\r\nThis means that user interactions with the Today Extension cannot influence the data shown in the Watch Glance.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n// when running in a Today Extension\r\n[[WCSession defaultSession] isPaired] == YES\r\n\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n// when running in a Today Extension\r\n[[WCSession defaultSession] isPaired] == NO\r\n\r\niOS 9.2"
