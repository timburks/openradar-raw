    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile running UI tests on an iOS simulator with multiple test cases, it's often the case that after a few run of tests, the XCUIApplication() instance is in a stalled state.\r\n\r\nThe app instance is not terminated, therefore, the next test case setUp() is not able to continue, and it produced the assertion failure:\r\n\r\nAssertion Failure: UI Testing Failure - App state is still not terminated\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try the UITest for the project on github: https://github.com/joemasilotti/UI-Testing-Cheat-Sheet\r\n2. Run the UITests\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll tests should complete without app state error\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tests failed because of app state error\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 / iOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
