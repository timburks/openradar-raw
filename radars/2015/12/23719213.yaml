        Summary:

        If you delete the iPad Pro simulator playgrounds no longer work.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Delete the iPad Pro simulator from the devices menu in Xcode
        2. Create a playground
        3. Write some code that should be executed

        Expected Results:

        The playground defaults back to another simulator and runs correctly.

        Actual Results:

        This error is produced: "Unable to find execution service for selected run destination."

        Notes:

        It might be nice for this error to at least specify what is needed to run playgrounds.
