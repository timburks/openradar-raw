    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening a Photos library that has custom permissions set (like a group ACL) Photos prompts to \"Repair permissions\" and there is no way to skip.  This removes the custom ACL and breaks my workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA Mac with 10.11.2 and at least 2 users.\r\n1) In System Preferences, go to Users & Groups\r\n2) Click the lock and authenticate as an admin.\r\n3) Click the plus sign at the bottom of the users list.\r\n4) Next to \"New\" choose Group.\r\n5) Give the groups a name (really doesn't matter what it is) i.e. Photos\r\n6) Click Create Group.\r\n7) The group should now be visible, so check the boxes for all the users that will use iPhoto.\r\n8) Close System Preferences.\r\n9) Navigate to where you want the Photos library to be (/Users/Shared/ is a good option).\r\n10) Copy the Photos library here.\r\n11) Once the copy is complete, select the Library and Get Info (âŒ˜-I)\r\n12) Click the lock in lower right and authenticate as an admin.\r\n13) Click the plus sign in the lower left.\r\n14) Choose your group and click select.\r\n15) Give that group Read & Write permissions.\r\n16) Open the Action button (the gear) and select Apply to Enclosed Items.\r\n17) Click OK.\r\n18) Log in as one of the users and open Photos.\r\n19) Get the wrong message about repairing permissions. (If not, try as the second user).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs long as my user can read/write, I should be able to access the Photos library without modifying anything.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhotos complains about the permissions, doesn't let me skip the repair, and then removes my ACL.\r\nThen when I quit Photos and go in as the second user, it complains about the permissions again and I have to let it repair.  Every time!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPhotos: Version 1.3 (350.23.0)\r\nOS X: 10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis worked as I wanted in 10.10.5.  It now is showing the above behavior in 10.11.2.  I'm not sure exactly when the above began."
