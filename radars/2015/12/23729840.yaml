        Summary:
        Often, when looking through the system log in the Console application, I'll find a message from a particular sender, and want to see what other messages have been output by that same sender. Right now, that involves either finding the name of that sender in the "Senders" list in the lower left, or typing the name in the search field in the upper right. I'd like to be able to just control-click on the existing console message, and select a contextual menu item that applies that filter for me.
