    description: "Autocorrect is triggered on the entry of a period or a space. This is problematic when you're typing out something like a domain name in a text file. \r\n\r\nAn example of this would be 'yandex.ru' being converted to 'yonder.' before the ru is ever entered.\r\n\r\nThis bug could be fixed by instead of triggering the correction on the entry of the period, waiting for a space to be placed as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open a text document on an OS X machine with Autocorrect enabled.\r\n2. Type \"yandex.ru\" in said text document.\r\n3. Observe the result of \"yonder.ru\" that you never intended.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nWhen typing a domain name or file extension the system should not autocorrect. It should not autocorrect unless there is a space after the period.\r\n\r\nTyping 'yandex.ru' should yield 'yandex.ru'\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n'yonder.ru' instead of 'yandex.ru'"
