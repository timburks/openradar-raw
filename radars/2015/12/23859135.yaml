        Summary:
        With El Capitan, the "File Open" dialog sometimes randomly lose all favorites in the sidebar. Devices and Network drives are still displayed but not favorites.
        This is fixable by removing the `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist` file.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open a system "File Open" dialog.

        Expected Results:
        - Favorites are shown in the sidebar.

        Actual Results:
        - Favorites may or may not be shown.

        Regression:
        Only seen this behavior in OS X 10.11.1
