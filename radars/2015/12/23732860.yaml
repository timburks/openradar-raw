    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iPhone or apple watch responds to push notification action on locked screen, Application does not get invoked in background mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Kill your app \r\n2) Send an Actionable  push notification to the device when the device is locked. \r\n3) iPhone or apple watch receives  the push notification.\r\n4) Hit an action like Accept/Deny on the locked screen\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should be launched in background mode to perform a short background task and hit call back\r\n- application:handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:completionHandler: to process notification. App should get few seconds to process the notification using background task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome times even if the user hits ACCEPT on notification when iPhone is locked or when user hits ACCEPT on notification on Apple watch, - application:handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:completionHandler: does not get called. Please note that this occurs unpredictably very few times, it seems that operating system \r\nis throttling actions taken on remote push notifications. \r\n\r\n\r\nWork around:\r\nUnlock iphone and again lock it. After that if the app receives actionable push notification, it starts working again.   \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1(13B143) and 2.0 (13S344)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 and Apple Watch"
