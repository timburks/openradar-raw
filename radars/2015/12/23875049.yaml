    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter a call to \"po <# something #>\" in the debugger, subsequent calls to String.init<T>(_ instance: T) and related methods will deadlock.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen only on actual iOS devices (i.e. not the simulator). I've created a proof of concept and attached it to the bug report. The stack trace of the deadlock is also attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached application, tap on the \"Test deadlock\" button. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe call to \"po\" should not cause deadlocks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application hangs. Pausing the debugger now will reveal that the process is stuck on a __psynch_mutexwait call inside String.init<T>(_ instance: T).\r\n\r\nIf the breakpoint on nop() is disabled the program doesn't hang.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm filing a bug here instead of the opensource bug tracker because this bug only happens on iOS devices and I don't know of a way to reproduce it with opensource tools (unless there's a way to run the Swift REPL on device?)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens on iPhone 6 - iOS 9.0.2 (13A452)\r\nDoesn't happen on iPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StringInterpolationDeadlock.zip' (http://cl.ly/e4SI) and 'stacktrace.png' (http://cl.ly/e4TA) were successfully uploaded."
