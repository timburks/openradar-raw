    description: "[Want to discuss? Get in touch with me @jamesreggio.]\r\n\r\nWhen a SFSafariViewController instance is presented in landscape, it becomes impossible to scroll to the bottom of the webpage. Furthermore, the scroll indicators are inaccurately rendered below the bottom of the viewable area.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load the app referenced below.\r\n2. Tap the 'Bugs' tab bar item.\r\n3. Tap the 'Content Inset + Landscape Usability Bug' button.\r\n4. Turn the device to landscape.\r\n5. Scroll quickly (flick) to the bottom of the webpage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe footer of the page (containing text with 'Running on Google App Engine') should be visible, as well as some padding below.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe footer of the page is truncated, and can only be seen by 'pulling' the page up from the bottom of the viewable area. (It immediately snaps back to being truncated when you remove your finger from the screen.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B137)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample project is available on GitHub here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jamesreggio/SFSafariViewControllerPlayground\r\n\r\nJust as in Radar #23706138, I believe that this is the result of incorrect calculations in your code to cleverly show and hide the navigation bar based upon scrolling speed and direction. If you slowly scroll to the bottom of a webpage (in a manner that doesn't case the navigation bar to collapse), this bug does not reproduce.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 on iOS 9.1 (13B137)"
