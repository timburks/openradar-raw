    description: "Per https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204100 :\r\n\"Mission Control offers a bird's-eye view of all your open windows, desktop spaces, full-screen apps, and Split View spaces, making it easy to switch between them. \"\r\n\r\nBut after Apple switched to space names (wich are not user-customizable) instead of the space preview thumbnail, user have to move mouse to the top, wasting time and effort wich seems not to be the intent of Mission Control and Mac OS usability goals."
