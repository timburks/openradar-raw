    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCurrently if you attempt to paste into the password field for a encrypted DMG it doesn't work. There are other places that use this same alert that doesn't allow pasting, but this is the easiest example.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an encrypted DMG (or use the attached empty example, the password is 'a')\r\n2. Double click to open\r\n3. Attempt to paste in the password field (probably from somewhere like 1Password so you can keep your passwords complex)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe password is pasted and you can open the encrypted DMG\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe paste doesn't work, and you have to type in a long password by hand.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- The current workaround I use is to mount these from the command line with `hdiutil attach path/to/foo.dmg -stdinpass`"
