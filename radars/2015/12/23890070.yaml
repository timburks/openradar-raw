    description: When editing the attributed text in a UILabel in a storyboard the editor shakes.  The UI is also very unresponsive (e.g. characters take 1-2 seconds to appear onscreen while editing).  While the storyboard is open CPU usage hangs out around 100% and when I close the storyboard it goes down to about 12.
