    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://23853195\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen running the OS X 10.11.2 installer from the Mac App Store over an existing OS X partition, after a successful install has been completed, /var/db/receipts does not exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install OS X 10.11.1 or lower (including OS X 10.10.5).\r\n2. Download OS X El Capitan, 10.11.2 from the Mac App Store.\r\n3. Install OS X 10.11.2.\r\n4. Upon a successful installation, check the receipts database.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe receipts database should contain software that has previously been installed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe package database will be empty.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue does not occur when installing the OS X 10.11.2 delta update on top of OS X 10.11.1. It also did not occur in previous OS X releases.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease fix as soon as possible. Our intention is to release OS X 10.11.2 to campus before the spring semester, but this bug prevents us from doing so. We have nearly 800 Macs that are eligible for the upgrade, and our intent is to upgrade about 300 of them before mid-January. Thanks!"
