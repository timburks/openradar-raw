    description: For reminders that are linked to an app using Handoff / NSUserActivity, the Today widget nicely displays the linked app icon and the icon is even highlighted on touch but the tap does nothing. I would expect it to open the app and continue the user activity, same as when tapped in the main Reminders app.
