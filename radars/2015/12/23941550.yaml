    description: "Summary:\r\nIt returns an empty string in at least two cases that you would expect to return nil, and I havenâ€™t been able to come up with a case where it actually returns nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and run tests for attached sample project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither both tests pass, the API is rewritten to return String instead of String?, or the documentation is updated to reflect when a nil is returned\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tests fail, since the pathExtension method returns an empty string in both cases"
