    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the shift key is activated, and is then held down, then letters typed will be lowercase but uppercase is expected.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a regression in iOS 9. It certainly worked as expected in previous versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Show a text text field in an iOS app, such as Notes\r\n2. Make the shift key be activated (white with filled in arrow, with keys on the keyboard shown in uppercase), either by starting a new line or sentence or by tapping it.\r\n3. With on finger, hold down the shift key.\r\n4. With other fingers, type something with characters A-Z.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhile holding the shift key down, typed characters should be uppercase.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe typed characters are lowercase.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe behaviour I expect is consistent with desktop operating systems such as OS X. Typing lowercase characters is easy, as this is the default state. If the user is making a continuous explicit action, the result should not be the same as the default state. The state of the shift key before pressing it should not affect this.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when typing an acronym/initialism at the start of a sentence I have to\r\n\r\n1. Notice the shift key is engaged.\r\n2. Tap it once to disengage.\r\n3. Hold it down and type the word.\r\n\r\nI would expect to skip straight to step 3.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro, iPad Air, iPhone 5S\r\n\r\nAttachments"
