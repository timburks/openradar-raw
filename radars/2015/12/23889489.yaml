    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a SafariViewController is presented from an app using ViewController-based status bar control with a light (white) status bar, and you edge swipe to dismiss, this will put the presenting app in a bad state.  Subsequent view controller presentations silently fail.  Navigation controller pushes or pops silently fail.  Really any kind of view hierarchy modification fails to take effect.  Only recourse is to kill and re-launch the app.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to stem from the status bar needing to change color during the dismissal.  Using the SafariViewController done button, or edge swiping slowly enough so that the status bar transitions before dismissal avoids this behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you present a SafariViewController from an app with a dark status bar, then the status bar doesn't need to change during dismissal, and the problem doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected results are that the edge swipe dismisses the SafariViewController without putting the presenting app in a bad state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEdge swipe dismissing the SafariViewController puts the presenting app in a bad state requiring a restart of the app to correct.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 (7C68) iOS SDK 9.2, or iOS 9.2 (13C75) on phone"
