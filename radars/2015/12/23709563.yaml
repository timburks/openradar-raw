    description: "Summary:\nThe 4th generation of that device isn't able to get paired with a Bluetooth keyboard. For text input the remote as the only input device is really a big bag of hurt. Maybe you just *forgot* to re-enable the appropriate code parts after commenting out for debug reasons. I'll forgive you... \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Power on tv\n- navigate to settings, bluetooth section\n- try to pair an Apple BT keyboard\n\nExpected Results:\nThe tv will get paired with that keyboard, so I can use it in every installed app - when it's needed.\n\nActual Results:\nNothing happens. tv won't pair with the keyboard.\n\nNotes:\nMy old 3rd generation tv can do that! And I love it soo much to use a keyboard while searching movies, YouTube or what else. For me there is no reason to got rid of this expected functionality."
