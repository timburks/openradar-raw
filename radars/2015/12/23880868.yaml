    description: "Summary:\r\nReferencing UISearchContainerViewController in a tvOS app will cause TestFlight validation to fail. The build will upload successfully but iTunes Connect will report that \"There was an error importing this build.\" Removing the reference to that controller fixes the issue (but is unacceptable).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new, empy tvOS app with valid app identifier, certificate, and provisioning profile\r\n2. Add a reference to UISearchContainerViewController\r\n3. Upload build to TestFlight\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild uploads successfully with no error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild uploads but iTunes Connect reports that \"There was an error importing this build.\""
