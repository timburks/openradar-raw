    description: "A friend is in the hospital. Another friend gave me their hospital room's phone number, address of the hospital and room number. It would be really helpful if I could label those addresses and phone numbers as \"hospital\" so I don't try to call them there after they've left, but the labels are healthy-people places like \"home\", \"company main\" or \"car\" (!).\r\n\r\n===== I Added:\r\n\r\nAh. Seems there are *custom* labels at least, but that doesn't work for Exchange servers, which I'm using. Any way to add that?"
