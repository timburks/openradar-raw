    description: "Summary:\r\nBefore watchOS 2, this validation step didn't exist, which allowed WatchKit apps to be submitted and approved on the store despite not having its Bundle ID conform to the rule of being only a single dot-separated component greater than the parent iOS app's bundle ID.\r\n\r\nNow, this validation step does exist which prevents **an existing, already-approved-and-submitted app from being uploaded to iTunes Connect**!! Furthermore, since iTunes Connect disallows bundle IDs to be changed, it literally prevents the iOS/Apple Watch app from being updated on the App Store.\r\n\r\nThis validation step must either be removed, or another check must be set in place so that apps that already are in the store despite not passing this validation pass the validation.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\n\r\nA few versions ago, we've added a WatchKit app to our app Nozbe. I named the WatchKit app's bundle id \"com.nozbe.watch.app\". It was fine for a few versions.\r\n\r\nWith version 2.5 of our app, I've ported the Watch app to WatchKit 2. However, the app's bundle ID raised alarms and wouldn't pass validation when uploading from Xcode. The bundle ID didn't match the required format — which is the iOS app + one additional segment. If I made the Bundle ID \"com.nozbe.watch\", it would be fine. \"com.nozbe.watch.app\" doesn't pass.\r\n\r\nSo I changed the bundle ID to pass the validation while uploading to com.nozbe.watch. However, while the initial upload passes, I cannot submit the app for review — iTunes Connect now raises an error that says I **cannot** change the Watch app's bundle ID.\r\n\r\nSo now this app is stuck in a limbo. I can't leave it unchanged, because it doesn't pass validation under WatchKit 2 rules. And I can't change it, because iTC won't let me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an iOS app (com.foo) with a WatchKit 1 app with a poorly named bundle ID (com.foo.watch.wat)\r\n2. Update the app to WatchKit 2\r\n3. Attempt upload to App Store\r\n4. (Doesn't pass validation)\r\n5. Change the bundle ID to match required format (com.foo.watch)\r\n6. (Doesn't pass validation either)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can update an Apple Watch app that's already available on the store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy app is stuck — can't move forward, can't step back. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI originally submitted this to DTS believing it's a problem on my side (Case ID: 631312407), however I was told that this isn't a problem with my code.\r\n\r\nI then submitted a request to iTunes Connect Support (982345107), however they couldn't help me directly.\r\n\r\nI believe they also submitted a radar in my name (23523761), but I can't see it — so I'm also posting it here.\r\n\r\nI'm also attaching a screenshot I'm getting while exporting the archiving from Xcode, and the response log from Application Loader.\r\n\r\nPlease help! I literally can't do anything without your help!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
