    description: "In portrait orientation, UISearchController's searchBar overlaps iPhone's status bar when the user returns from viewing the detail view of a search result after rotating the device during that detail view.\r\n\r\nThis occurs even with Apple's own \"Table Search with UISearchController\" sample code, found at https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/TableSearch_UISearchController/Introduction/Intro.html (also included as an attached file, with a screenshot of the UI problem).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  On iPhone, perform a search using UISearchController on a tableView.\r\n2.  Select one of the cells of one of the returned search results.\r\n3.  When the detail for that cell is revealed, rotate the device.\r\n4.  Navigate back to the search results list.\r\n5.  Rotate iPhone to portrait orientation. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe searchBar does not overlap the status bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n The searchBar overlaps the status bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 or 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug is largely a duplicate of rdar://21765864."
