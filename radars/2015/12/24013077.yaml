    description: iWork for iOS only offers a very small list of color themes for charts as options, with no ability to customize colors per data series. It would be very, very useful to be able to apply custom colors to individual elements in a chart. Not to mention that the limited choices iWork currently offers are largely dull, depressing color schemes.
