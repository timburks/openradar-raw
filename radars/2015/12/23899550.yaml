    description: "I often want to drag images from Photos.app into an email program. (Not Mail.app)\n\nThat worked great in iPhoto. However drag/drop in Photos.app is weird and broken. It really only works when I first drag the file into finder, then drag the resulting file into a program accepting images via drag&drop.\n\nWhy so complicated? I understand that some image resources might be remote so you need some proxy handler, but at least for images already on disk this should be transparent. \n\nAttached how this looks in MailPlane. Chrome can’t deal with these “images” either.\n\nDeath by a thousand cuts."
