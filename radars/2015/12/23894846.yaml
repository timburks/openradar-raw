    description: "Summary:\r\ndispatch_async to a queue other than the main queue leaks memory. It only appears in iOS 9.2. It works perfect in other iOS versions. So I guess it is a regression of iOS 9.2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen and run the project here: https://github.com/onevcat/DispatchMemoryLeakDemo\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe demo runs without problem. Memory does not increase unbounded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe memory increases until the app crashes in iOS 9.2 devices. On other iOS versions or even iOS simulator with 9.2, memory keeps reasonable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2(13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can find a demo here https://github.com/onevcat/DispatchMemoryLeakDemo\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus/iPhone 6"
