    description: "Summary:\r\nBoth iTunes and the iOS Music App provide a way to indicate that a user doesn't like a \"For You\" suggestion in Apple Music. However, this feature is 1) hard to find, 2) does not provide any confirmation of interaction, and 3) does not actually remove the unwanted suggestion from \"For You.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subscribe to Apple Music\r\n2. Go to \"For You\" section in iTunes or Apple Music app\r\n3. In iTunes, select elipses (...) next to suggestion and pick \"Recommend less like this.\" In Apple Music, long press on suggestion and select \"I Don't Like This Suggestion.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn either app, the unwanted suggestion should be removed from the collection view, which should re-organize itself to fill the empty space. At the very least, a message should appear or an animation should occur that confirms the user's selection.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.2 Beta (15C48a) and iOS 9.1 (13B143)"
