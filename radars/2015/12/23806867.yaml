        Summary:
        Documentation download fails with MAS Version 7.2 (7C68)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open xcode
        open preferences
        click downloads
        click the download link next to any of the documentation sets (under the simulator download section)

        Expected Results:
        Download the docs

        Actual Results:

        Could not download and install iOS 9.2 Documentation. Don't know how to install package with extension  from file:///Users/mike/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode/Downloads/com.apple.adc.documentation.iOS-92.3.. Downloaded from {
            dependencies =     (
            );
            fileSize = 1071665369;
            identifier = "com.apple.adc.documentation.iOS";
            name = "iOS 9.2 Documentation";
            source = "https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Documentation/Xcode_7.2_beta_2_DocSets/03143046A.dmg";
            userInfo =     {
                ActivationPredicate = "7.2.0 >= '7.2'";
                Category = Documentation;
                IconType = IDEDownloadablesTypeDocSet;
                InstallPrefix = "/Users/mike/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets";
                InstalledIfAllReceiptsArePresentOrNewer =         {
                    "com.apple.pkg.7.0.iOSDocset" = "10.9.0.0.1.1446334486";
                };
                RequiresADCAuthentication = 1;
                Summary = "My description of content";
            };
            version = "92.3";
        }.

        Regression:
        Did not occur on 7.1 MAS version of Xcode

        Notes:

        The download link in the error message can be used to download the installer, but thatâ€™s wonky as it installs the docs into / and not where Xcode wants them
