    description: "Summary:\r\nUtilizing the standard functionality of the UITabBarController's \"more\" contains issues on the iPhone 6/6s Plus. When you have a tab bar controller that contains more than 4 items, it'll automatically generate a \"More\" area that houses all additional tabs. Tap the 6th or 7th item inside the more area while in portrait. The content view controller will push onto the stack as expected and be visible. Now rotate the device to landscape. The view controller completely disappears. Rotating back to portrait returns the view controller onto the view. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an application with a UITabBarController as the base that contains six or more view controllers, all of which should be embedded within their own respective UINavigationControllers. This will result in the tab bar creating the \"More\" tab that holds onto tabs 5+ while in portrait. In landscape the tab bar will pull tabs 5, 6, and 7 out of more and put them in the tab bar. \r\n\r\nYou should now have six+ view controllers connected to your tab bar controller, each of them is a UINavigationController with an embedded UIViewController. Make each of the embedded UIViewControllers distinguishable from the tab bar's background e.g. set the view's background color. \r\n\r\n1. Launch the application in portrait. \r\n2. Navigate to the more tab. \r\n3. Select either the 6th or 7th item in the list.\r\n4. Rotate to landscape. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping the 6th or 7th item of more and rotating to landscape should result in no loss of view for the selected view controller. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTapping the 6th or 7th item of more and rotating to landscape results in the selected view controller disappearing. It returns upon rotating back to portrait. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8+\r\n\r\nDevice:\r\niPhone 6/6s Plus\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis appears to only happen if you have your content View Controller embedded within a UINavigationController. If you just have the view controller itself this bug does not exist."
