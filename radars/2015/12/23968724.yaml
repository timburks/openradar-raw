    description: "Summary:\r\nevery time I insert an SD card into my Mac, it will open the Photos app (which can take up to 30 minutes) - even if all I want to do is erase the card and write a new image for my Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. insert SD card\r\n2. wait for Photos to launch\r\n3. go make coffee\r\n4. tell Photos to not ever open for this particular card (I have a bunch)\r\n5. quit Photos\r\n6. actually do something useful with the card\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter I insert an SD card into my Mac, I expect to be able to manipulate it directly, without having to fight with an application. Photos doesn't open when I attach a USB thumb drive...\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to wait for 30 minutes for Photos to open, or to finish updating a database.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.2 (and 10.11.1 before it)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIdeally, there'd be a central \"Do not open Photos whenever an SD card is attached to the system as it might not actually contain photos\" selection. Maybe rename \"CD & DVDs\" in System Preferences to \"Media\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nthere are no situations where this does not occur"
