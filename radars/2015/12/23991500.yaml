    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the view used to present SFSafariViewController and the SFSafariViewController have different `preferredStatusBarStyle`, the app will hang when you do a quick edge swipe dismissal gesture to a certain extent. In the attached project, when you present the Safari View, the previous view will add a colour indicator to show where to edge swipe to when dismissing for easier bug reproduction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup project to have a .LightContent preferredStatusBarStyle\r\n2. Present SFSafariViewController\r\n3. Do a quick edge swipe to about 1/5 of iPhone 6 screen width\r\n4. Release your finger to cancel the gesture\r\n5. Bug appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStatus Bar will remain the same. \r\nApp will not hang, Safari View should be useable.\r\nEdge Swiping back will return to original view\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStatus bar turns into .LightContent\r\nThe entire view is disabled. \r\nNavigationBar and TabBar buttons are disabled\r\nScrollView in the web content does not register the scrolling\r\nEdge swiping back to the original view will return to a blank view\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe example project can be found here: https://github.com/meteochu/SafariViewSwipeBug\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iPhone on iOS 9.2, including the simulator."
