    description: "Summary:\r\nNo matter which command line options you use to invoke the utility (I've tried -c, -d, and -u) it always works as if no command line parameters were used, i.e., it outputs the list of unique lines in the input.\r\nInvoking the utility with an input file and no output file (it should output the results to standard output) blocks the utility, just like any utility blocks when taking its input from a pipe and nothing is coming through it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run \"cat /etc/hosts | uniq -c\" (without the double quotes) in Terminal.app. Repeat replacing -c command line option in step 1 with -d or -u.\r\n2. Run \"uniq /etc/hosts\" in Terminal.app (without the double quotes)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. A list of repeat counts and text lines from the input file, separated by space, a list of duplicated, and a list of unique lines in the input file, respectively.\r\n2. A list of unique lines in the input file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The output is the same as running \"cat /etc/hosts | uniq\" (without the quotes).\r\n2. The utility blocks as if it was expecting data from an input file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI think this is pretty serious since it breaks all scripts using uniq.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt happens all the time and does not require a special software or hardware configuration.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
