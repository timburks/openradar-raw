        Summary:
        Sometimes the system freezes when running sysdiagnose. I need to powercycle the MacBook to get it working again.

        I’m attaching the latest spindump_sysdiagnose created in /var/tmp when I had the problem last time. I wanted to run sysdiagnose when I had networking problems with Mail.app: rdar://problem/23611829

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * press shift+ctrl+alt+cmd+. to run sysdiagnose

        Expected Results:
        * sysdiagnose created in /var/tmp

        Actual Results:
        * system freezes completely

        Regression:

        Notes:
        This is the continuation of rdar://problem/21817948 since I’m still having the issue sometimes with the latest OS X releases.
