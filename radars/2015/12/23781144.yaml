    description: "Summary:\r\nThe SFSafariViewController instance that is presented in our app is always blank. It has no content, no navigation bar (where Done button should be), not subviews, nothing at all.\r\n\r\nIn the Xcode simulator it will sit in that state forever. However on a device after about a minute the following debug message will appear.\r\n\r\nFailed to get remote view controller with error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4099 \"The connection to service named com.apple.uikit.viewservice.com.apple.SafariViewService was interrupted, but the message was sent over an additional proxy and therefore this proxy has become invalid.\" UserInfo={NSDebugDescription=The connection to service named com.apple.uikit.viewservice.com.apple.SafariViewService was interrupted, but the message was sent over an additional proxy and therefore this proxy has become invalid.}\r\n\r\nThis bug appears to be specific to one of our projects. I have created a test project and SFSafariViewController works as expected. We are also attempting to load the Google Search landing page, for the purposes of this bug report, in an attempt to eliminate possible resource overload caused by large websites.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn instance of SFSafariViewController should load the website on presentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA blank, empty white view is displayed."
