    description: "Summary:\r\nI realise this is unsupported behaviour, so perhaps file this under \"Enhancement Requests\" as well. \r\n\r\nBasically, I've configured my framework target to specify more than one value in `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS`, including cross platform SDKs. I use this to allow building individual OS X, iOS, tvOS and watchOS binaries from a single Xcode target — this reduces maintenance as my source files don't get out of sync.\r\n\r\nThis all works fine, but the destination list of any targets that depend on this framework also show all of the possible destinations (and shouldn't).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Xcode workspace\r\n2. Select the \"Handle\" scheme and check the available destinations — it should show both OS X and iOS destinations\r\n3. Select the \"HandleDemo-OSX\" scheme and note the available destinations.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause I've explicitly set a single value (macosx) for `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS`, I'd expect just OS X destinations here (and the inverse for my iOS scheme).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth iOS and OS X destinations are shown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.2 (7C68) / OS X Version 10.11.2 (15C50)"
