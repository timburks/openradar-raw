    description: "Summary:\r\nOur application (3DRobotics Solo) is extremely crashy deep inside of MapKit - specifically inside the private API VectorKit.\r\n\r\nAfter much review of the code we cannot identify any issues with our MapKit usage that is incorrect. We're not abusing the APIs or doing anything weird.\r\n\r\nWe have narrowed this down to a test app (attached) that can reproduce the issue by repeatedly adding and removing MKAttachements to a map.\r\n\r\nThe test app fails repeatedly on iOS 8.4. We've been stress testing this app on as many devices as possible and our findings are\r\n\r\niPhone 6, iOS 9 beta: Not crashing\r\niPad Mini 2, iOS 9 beta: Not crashing\r\niPhone C: iOS 8.4: Crashes after approx 15-30 minutes of running\r\niPad Air 1 (A1475): Crashes after approx 1 minute of running.\r\n\r\nThis _could_ indicate that the problem is fixed on iOS 9 - however we are receiving a variety of MapKit/VectorKit related crashes from the app in the field - and the test code provide only reproduces one of the many crashes we've seen.\r\n\r\nIt's also very interesting how the iPad Air 1 crashes very reliably while the other devices do not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1: Build and run MapCrasher on iOS 8.4 and run it on an iPad Air 1.\r\n2: Wait a few minutes\r\n3: Crash!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs far as we can tell we're not abusing MKMapView.\r\n\r\nThis _seems_ to be a common problem for MapKit users on iOS 8 and even older: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vectorkit+crashes&t=osx\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee attached crash\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 1 (A1475)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Mapcrasher  7-31-15, 14-22.crash' and 'Mapcrasher.zip' were successfully uploaded."
