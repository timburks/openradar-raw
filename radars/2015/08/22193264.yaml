    description: "Summary:\r\nThe use of the NSDateFormatterShortStyle in a date formatter with the locale set to @\"en-AU\", Australia English, results in a date format that for August 7th 2015 would be \"7/08/2015\".  Why is there a leading zero on the month?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a date that has a single digit day, and a single digit month.\r\n2. Setup a formatter to use the NSDateFormatterShortStyle.\r\n3. Set the locale for the formatter to @\"en-AU\".\r\n4. Convert the date to a string using stringFromDate:.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect at the least to see \"7/8/2015\", or possibly even \"7/8/15\". The US version (en-US) shows \"8/7/15\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe result is \"7/08/2015\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 [13A4305g]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis date format appears to be incorrect according to my Australian teammates.\r\nA project built specifically to showcase this issue is attached.  Built with Xcode 7 beta 4.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll simulator versions in iOS9, as well as an iPhone 5 using iOS9.  Other phones are affected.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DateLocaleTester.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nSee the test app at https://github.com/Thunor/DateLocaleTester"
