        Summary:
        I have a few views in a hierarchy within a UITableViewCell. If I select all these views, then drag them to the canvas, Interface Builder halts then crashes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Place some views in a table view cell, use CMD-Click to select them all, then drag them to the canvas.

        Expected Results:
        The cells are placed within a placeholder view on the canvas, the table view cell is empty.

        Actual Results:
        After a few seconds of beach ball, Xcode crashes.

        Regression:
        This seemed to never be a problem pre-XCode 7.

        Notes:
        A crash log is attached.
