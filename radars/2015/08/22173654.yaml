        Summary:

        Xcode hangs while compiling storyboards or indexing the project.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Install Xcode 7 beta 5 (7A165t ) on OS X 10.11 beta 6 (15A244d)
        2) Build a watchOS 2 project

        Expected Results:

        Project should compile and run.

        Actual Results:

        Project does not compile and run. Indexing of the project also hangs.

        Notes:

        I only tested this using a watchOS 2 project.
