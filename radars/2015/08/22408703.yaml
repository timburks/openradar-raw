    description: "Summary:\r\nDoing a local search for the regex “(.*)+; //(.*)+^” will hang Xcode, and continue to hang every time the search field is opened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a file in Xcode\r\n2. Open the in-pane search field with command+F\r\n3. Change the Find options to “Regular Expression”\r\n4. Paste the following regular expression in to the field: (.*)+; //(.*)+^\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing is found, or some error is shown to indicate the regex is invalid\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode hangs permanently, and hangs every time the search field is opened after relaunch.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happens in Xcode 7 beta as well as Xcode 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe regex is cached in some global OS X cache. The cache can be cleared by opening a search bar in another application, like Safari, and changing the search text."
