    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLSession seems to ignore the configuration parameter that you pass in the initializer, and what's worse: it looks like it returns a different configuration every time you query that property, making using  NSURLSessionConfiguration impossible.\r\n\r\nYou can find attached a playground showing what's happening. Open it with Xcode 6 and with Xcode 7 to see the difference\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.- Store in a property NSURLSessionConfiguration.defaultSessionConfiguration()\r\n\r\n2.- Pass that into the initializer of NSURLSession\r\n\r\n3.- Query the property 'configuration' of the created NSURLSession\r\n\r\n4.- Query it again, and again... Notice that it always changes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe returned NSURLSessionConfiguration is consistent with what was passed in the initalizer\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe returned NSURLSessionConfiguration is changing every time the property is queried.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 5 (build 13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is of vital importance to fix, since the use of NSURLSessionConfiguration is key to a lot of our core technologies.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator and iPod Touch"
