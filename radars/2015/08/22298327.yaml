        Summary:
        Xcode’s documentation browser’s search sometimes isn’t very helpful, as relevant content is not found.
        E.g when I search for CoreBluetooth, the module name, it almost only finds API diffs. See attached screenshot.

        One has to search for Core Bluetooth (with space), to find all the relevant contents, e.g the framework reference. The search really shouldn’t be that picky.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In Xcode’s documentation browser, search for CoreBluetooth

        Expected Results:
        Framework reference and Framework Overview in the Top Results

        Actual Results:
        Only API diffs and sample code in the results

        Regression:
        I didn’t test earlier Xcode versions
