        Summary:
        When an enum in Swift has some cases with associated values, and some cases without, the cases without associated values will all get the same value when converted to strings.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an enum with two cases that have an associated values, and two cases without
        2. Print the string value for each of the cases with no associated value

        Expected Results:
        Each case should produce a string value with the case name

        Actual Results:
        All cases produce the same string value: the case name of the first case defined without associated values.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        I have attached a playground demonstrating the issue.
