        Summary:
        When reporting an iMessage sender for sending spam/junk, it only deletes the conversation from the local device, instead of all locations that iMessage account is signed in to. This is not good because the message can be offensive or harmful in addition to being annoying, and now the user has to experience that message multiple times to delete it from their devices/Macs.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Receive an iMessage from an unknown sender (not in your contact list).
        2. On your iOS device, tap Report Junk
        3. Tap “Delete and Report Junk”

        Expected Results:
        The spam message and sender are removed from all devices signed into that iMessage account.

        Actual Results:
        The spam message and sender are removed only from the local iOS device for that iMessage account. It remains visible (and potentially offensive/harmful) on all other devices the user’s iCloud account is signed into.
