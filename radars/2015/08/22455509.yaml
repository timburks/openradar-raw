        Summary:
        When specifying allowsEditing on an UIImagePickerController, the selected image first appears small and centered in the cropper, but if you pinch it larger to fill the square, it then only returns the top left square of the image.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create and show a UIImagePickerController fullscreen on an iPad with allowsEditing set to YES. Select a photo and notice that it is centered and small. Move the image to where you want it cropped and hit done, only to have the top left corner returned.

        Expected Results:
        The cropper would allow users to select a square portion of the image they have selected, and display the portion that will actually be used.

        Actual Results:
        The user gets unexpected results.
