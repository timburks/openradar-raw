        Summary:

        In iOS 1-8, the Phone app shows the location of American phone numbers (for example, under a 917 number it might say New York). In iOS 9 this now appears to work for UK numbers.

        However, a number that showed as being from New York before the upgrade to iOS 9 now shows no location.

        I’m not sure if this means that the US lookup is broken or that it can currently only lookup numbers from the current country? Either way it feels like a regression.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Receive a call from the US while being in the UK.

        Expected Results:

        Number is described by the location of the incoming number.

        Actual Results:

        No location is displayed. In country numbers do now have the location.

        Regression:

        In the sense that this worked in iOS 8, yes, it’s a regression. This is the first iOS 9 beta I’ve run on my phone so I don’t know if this is new to this seed.

        Notes:
        Great to see the lookup of UK numbers. I’ve been wanting this feature since 2008!
