        Summary:
        Universal links are amazing! My company has been waiting for this feature for years. We were pretty excited to implement it as soon as possible. Unfortunately, our app connects to different subdomains based on the user’s login. We currently have about 1300 different subdomains, each representing a different client of ours, and each of those representing anywhere from a few dozen to thousands of users. Currently, our only solution is to include every single subdomain we own in our entitlements file. But this worries me still, because when a user installs our app their phone will try to download the authorization file for every single subdomain, even though in most cases, they only need to be connected to 1 domain, and it’s pretty rare for a single user to need to be connected to more than 2.

        It’s not hard to imagine an app that connects to self hosted sites either, like the WordPress app, where specifying every single possible domain simply isn’t an option.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have a site with user generated subdomains that you want to connect to an app for things like handoff and universal links.

        Expected Results:
        While the entitlements method is likely preferable for most sites that will only have their main domain and a www subdomain, it would be helpful, if there was a way to add domains at runtime. Sites would still be able to be vetted as authorizing the app.

        Actual Results:
        The only option is to either not support universal links and handoff, or to list every possible domain.
