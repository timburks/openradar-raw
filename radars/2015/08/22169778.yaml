        Summary:
        NSTableView cells default to the system font with proportional number variants. They should instead use the system font with fixed pitched numbers on El Capitan. The current state of affairs results in jarring inconsistencies for tables containing numbers aligned one under the other.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open “Displays” in System Preferences
        2. Switch “Resolution:” to “Scaled”

        Expected Results:
        The numbers in the resolution table align properly like on OS X Yosemite and before.

        Actual Results:
        The numbers in the resolution table don’t align properly.

        Regression:
        This wasn’t an issue on OS X Yosemite and before, due to the numbers in the system font always being fixed pitch.

        Notes:
        In general, I fully support proportional numbers in fonts. They just don’t look good in tables.
