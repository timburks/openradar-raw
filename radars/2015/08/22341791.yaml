    description: "Summary:\r\nI sometimes want to open a link from a website in private browsing mode. To do that, I first have to copy that URL into the pasteboard, open a New Private Window, and paste the URL.\r\n\r\nIt would be much nicer to ctrl click on a link in a non-private window and have an option to “Open Link in new Private Window”.\r\n\r\nThis would is useful for example when browsing news sites linking to 3rd party sites you don’t know and you want to visit those 3rd party sites privately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn a non-private window, ctrl click on a link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOption to open link in a new private window\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such option\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis option would be especially useful for urls using url shorteners: Even when you hover the link to see to which url it goes, you don't know where it will lead to, so opening it in a private window will be often be useful there."
