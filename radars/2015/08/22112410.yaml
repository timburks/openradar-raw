    description: "Summary:\r\nCompose an email with an image attachment.  \"Edit\" the image with the Markup feature.  Send email.  Wait a few minutes (the mail needs to send). Put attachment in trash.  Try and empty trash.  Just try.  I dare you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail.app\r\n2. Compose new message.\r\n3. Add image attachment.\r\n4. Edit the attachment with \"Markup\".\r\n5. Send message.\r\n6. Trash image file.\r\n7. Wait a few minutes.\r\n8. Attempt to empty trash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the trash is emptied.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can't empty Trash because the files I've attached to a mail message are still in use by Mail (open files).  See attached screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf you don't edit the file before sending, the file handle is not leaked."
