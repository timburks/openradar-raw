        Summary:

        There is no top layout guide (referencing bottom of the navigation bar) when editing a Xib in the interface builder.  Currently use of this guide for constraints is limited to programmatic use.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) create an empty UI
        2) add a view, and add an object E.g.: button or label to that view
        3) attempt to add a top constraint e.g.: Control click and drag the line upwards
        4) observe that no top layout guide is available to reference

        Expected Results:
        Expect to have a top layout guide or similar guide allowing a reference to the variable position of the navigation bar in a view

        Actual Results:
        No such guide exists: top of the view is the closest equivalent

        Regression:
        NA

        Notes:
        NA
