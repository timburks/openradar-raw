        Summary:
        Writing
            [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarStyle = UIStatusBarStyleLightContent;
        in an iOS 9-only project should warn that this API is deprecated in iOS 9, as it does when i write
            [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleLightContent];
        which is, in the end, the same code. I recognized that currently only for the statusbar but that probably applies to all setter-methods of any property that is deprecated in iOS 9.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Add the two lines above to an iOS 9 project, only the second one will get a warning

        Expected Results:
        Regardless of the usage of the dot-syntax or message-sending-syntax, it should reliably warn about the usage of a deprecated API

        Actual Results:
        There is no warning using the dot-syntax

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
