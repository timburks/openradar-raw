    description: "Summary:\nUsing the “…” and “..<“ operators to get a slice of an array raises EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION in Xcode 7 beta 6.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Put the following code in a new playground or iOS:\n\nvar shoppingList = [\"Eggs\",\"Milk\"]  \nshoppingList.append(\"Flour\")  \nshoppingList += [\"Baking Powder\"]  \nshoppingList += [\"Chocolate Spread\", \"Cheese\", \"Butter\"]  \nshoppingList.count  \nshoppingList[4...6] \n\nExpected Results:\nThe output of the last statement should be [\"Chocolate Spread\", \"Cheese\", \"Butter\"]\n\nActual Results:\nThe output is an error: “Execution was interrupted. Reason: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_i386_INVOP, subcode=0x0).”\n\nRegression:\nThis worked in Xcode 7 beta 5 and doesn’t work in Xcode 7 beta 6.\n\nNotes:\nPlease note that this fails the same way when using the “..<“ instead of “…”."
