    description: "Summary:\r\nAt present I am unable to update any prerelease version. When I click the Save button, the error returns a 400 Bad Request which messes up the HTML.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I went into prod.ly 1.3.0 (419) beta version, which is the first build of the 1.3.0 train\r\n2. I put some text into the \"what to test box\"\r\n3. I clicked on Save\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe changes should get saved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The HTML disintegrates (see screen shot) so that you are not able to proceed\r\n- the Console shows \"Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)\"\r\n- the URL that is trying to be opened contains platforms/[object%20Object] which is probably the reason\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0 (10601.1.43), OS X 10.10.5 (14F27)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI also tried clearing the history. I attached the plain text of the Safri console messages.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens on 10.10.5, 10.11 and on iPad, regardless of Safari version"
