        Summary:
        When deallocating an UIViewController that holds a strong reference to an UISearchController the following message is logged to the console: "Attempting to load the view of a view controller while it is deallocating is not allowed and may result in undefined behavior (<UISearchController: 0x7fddc2832e10>)". This happens because UISearchController removes some gesture recognizers from its view in -dealloc, which causes the view to be loaded. A sample project is attached: just run it in the simulator, tap the button to push a table view controller with an associated UISearchController and tap "Back" to deallocate the table view controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Deallocate an UIViewController that holds a strong reference to an UISearchController.

        Expected Results:
        The UISearchController does not attempt to load its view while it is being deallocated.

        Actual Results:
        The UISearchController attempts to load its view while it is being deallocated.

        Regression:
        Reproducible at least on iOS 9 beta 5. Did not happen with iOS 8.
