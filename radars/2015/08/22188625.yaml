    description: "Summary:\r\nMy builds stopped working in Xcode 7 beta 5 because clang is balking over a precompiled framework library from the Open Source \"Growl\" project:\r\n\r\nld: building for OSX, but linking in object file built for (unknown), file '/Volumes/Data/daniel/Sources-Modern/RSCommon/OpenSource/Growl-SDK/Growl.framework/Growl' for architecture x86_64\r\n\r\nPut aside for a moment the fact that I will probably be removing Growl from my app :) It still serves to illustrate a change in clang that may affect linking against other pre-existing libraries.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached \"Growl\" binary\r\n2. From the command line with Xcode 7 beta 5 tools, run:\r\n\r\nclang ./Growl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClang should process the library as an input and yield (in this case) an error about missing a _main symbol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClang doesn't get that far, it balks over the binary apparently because it is unable to determine its platform suitability:\r\n\r\nld: building for OSX, but linking in object file built for (unknown), file 'Growl' for architecture x86_64\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n\r\nNote that if you run the same command with clang from Xcode 7 beta 4 or earlier, the library is accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A244d)\r\n\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 5 (7A176x)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Growl' was successfully uploaded."
