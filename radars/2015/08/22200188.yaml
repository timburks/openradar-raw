        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        The What’s New in Safari 9.0 documentation has a minor error in the “Unprefixed CSS Properties” section. It incorrectly states:

        “The properties in Newly supported ECMAScript 6 properties are now fully supported by Safari, without the -webkit- prefix.”

        ECMAScript is the spec for javascript, it is not the spec for CSS.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.

        1. Open a browser
        2. Visit https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH9-SW28
        3. Note that the “Unprefixed CSS Properties” section incorrectly states “ECMAScript”, which is not the spec governing CSS. The W3C governs the CSS spec.

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        I expect the documentation to *not* say ECMAScript regarding new CSS properties. Perhaps it should reference W3C, or CSS3?

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        The page incorrectly states the new css properties are part of the ECMAScript 6 spec.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
