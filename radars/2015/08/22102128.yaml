    description: "Summary:\r\nCIDetector’s face detection is not accurate. In a picture containing 7 faces — 4 of which are quite vertical and facing front — it detects 0. It needs much improvement.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun sample app and read the console logs. It has nothing because none faces are detected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt least it should detect the 4th and 7th faces.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt detects none.\r\n\r\nSample Code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/2N2i2x3E3127"
