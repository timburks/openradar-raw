    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to build a watchOS 2 app for ad-hoc distribution, but it's failing with the following error:\r\n\r\nerror: Embedded binary is not signed with the same certificate as the parent app. Verify the embedded binary target's code sign settings match the parent app's.  \r\n  Embedded Binary Signing Certificate: Not Code Signed  \r\n  Parent App Signing Certificate: iPhone Distribution: [My signing certificate]  \r\n\r\nI can't distribute my iPhone app either, since it fails to build due to the watchOS 2 cert issue.\r\n\r\nI've verified that the certificate is the same, so the error Xcode is producing is not correct.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iPhone app with a watchOS 2 app.\r\n2. Choose Product > Archive\r\n3. Build fails due to the following code signing error:\r\n\r\nerror: Embedded binary is not signed with the same certificate as the parent app. Verify the embedded binary target's code sign settings match the parent app's.  \r\n  Embedded Binary Signing Certificate: Not Code Signed  \r\n  Parent App Signing Certificate: iPhone Distribution: [My signing certificate]  \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild should succeed and allow me to distribute my watchOS 2 app \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild fails with code signing error:\r\n\r\nerror: Embedded binary is not signed with the same certificate as the parent app. Verify the embedded binary target's code sign settings match the parent app's.  \r\n  Embedded Binary Signing Certificate: Not Code Signed  \r\n  Parent App Signing Certificate: iPhone Distribution: [My signing certificate]  \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 5 (7A176x)\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)"
