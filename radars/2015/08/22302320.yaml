    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Swift, generating Managed Object subclasses with to-many relationships fails to generate KVO-compliant to-many accessors.\L\r\n\r\nFrom Xcode 7 beta 5 release notes:\r\n\r\nThe NSManaged attribute can now be used with methods as well as properties, for access to Core Dataâ€™s automatically-generated Key-Value-Coding-compliant to-many accessors.\L\r\n\r\n@NSManaged var employees: NSSet\L \L\r\n\r\n@NSManaged func addEmployeesObject(employee: Employee)\L @NSManaged func removeEmployeesObject(employee: Employee)\L @NSManaged func addEmployees(employees: NSSet)\L\r\n@NSManaged func removeEmployees(employees: NSSet)\L\r\n\r\nThese can be declared in your NSManagedObject subclass. (17583057)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Use Swift\r\n1. Create a Core Data iOS app\r\n2. Add models with to-many relationships\r\n3. Generate the Managed Object subclasses\r\n4. Note that the to-many accessors are NOT generated for you by Xcode\r\n5. Cry yourself to sleep\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should generate the to-many accessors for you in Swift.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode does not generate the to-many accessors for you.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0 beta 5 (7A176x)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
