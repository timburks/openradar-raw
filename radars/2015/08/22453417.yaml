        Summary:
        My app needs to be notified when the user is physically moving from place to place so that I can do stuff in the background and determine if my user is walking or whatever. I intended on doing this using a HKObserverQuery and new step counts. After having some problems I noticed in the docs that some sample types (like the step count) has a minimum frequency of 1 hour. This is terrible for me because with that I'm not able to achieve what I was trying to do and I therefore have to use CoreMotions CMMotionActityManager. If I want to use CoreMotion instead my app asks the user for another permission. I do not want to ask for another permission. I really don't. I do not care the slightest about any raw gyro data or whatever. I only care about processed data out of HealthKit since it is easy to understand for my users. I want steps and if you give me the permission to only read the steps I can do useful things for you, but with CoreMotion I have to ask for everything and I just do not want to do that and there is no way for my user to determine if I'm doing something shady in the background or not. HealthKit is just so much more comprehensible for the average user than CoreMotion and the little toggle that show up 3 layers down in the settings app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create App.
        2. Try to make app useful without being marked as "evil"
        3. Write radar because that unfortunately doesn't work

        Expected Results:
        HealthKit should give me some way to notify me when new data I'm interested in is coming in.
        For me personally I would love to see all classes in CoreMotion providing access to processed data to be merged with HealthKit so that there is a easy distinction for the user between they are checking on motion data between they are checking if I physically move my phone to a different place.

        Actual Results:
        I have to ask for multiple permission which are very hard to comprehend by the average user.
