    description: "Summary:\r\nInter-App Audio node apps that are launched into the background from an IAA host app do not appear in the multitasking menu, until they are moved to the foreground. Consequently, they cannot be closed by the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Inter-App Audio Host app (like GarageBand)\r\n2. From this app, host an IAA node app (like Figure), without bringing it to the foreground\r\n3. Double-tap the home button to open the multitasking menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIAA node app is visible in multitasking menu\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIAA node app is not visible\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nReproduced on iOS 7 and 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue causes serious problems when host apps crash or are closed by the user via the multitasking menu, or when node apps do not completely shut down in the background. The consequence is that the device must be rebooted in order to purge the active process.\r\n\r\nWe consider this a very serious problem with Inter-App Audio.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nReproduced on all iOS devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
