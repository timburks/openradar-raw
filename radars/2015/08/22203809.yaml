        Summary:
        When playing music with the Music app, and a song comes up that you don’t like anymore, you should be able to remove it from your library more easily. At present, you can’t remove it using the “…” button in the Now Playing screen, or from within a playlist, so you have to navigate to your Library, search for the song, and delete it there. Please add a “Remove from My Music” item to the “..” menu on either the Now Playing screen and/or each playlist item.
