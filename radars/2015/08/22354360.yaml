    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22307592\r\n\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://22307567\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn order to test the latest version of El Capitan on a new machine, you have to download the first beta of OS X 10.11, the second beta of OS X 10.11, the third beta of OS X 10.11, the fourth beta of OS X 10.11, the fifth beta of OS X 10.11, the sixth beta of OS X 10.11, and the Nth beta of OS X 10.11.\r\n\r\nEach of these full installers weighs in at 2-3 GB and many of the people you want to test this release are on network connections that are well under 100 Mbit. It’s not hyperbolic to say this can take several days.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Get the latest beta release of 10.11.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should be able to get to the latest revision level with a single download.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou currently need to download all beta releases to get to the current revision level.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPrevious OS X beta releases have had incremental and full installers available.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe current situation acts as a disincentive for testing your releases. If it takes me three days to install the beta on a new Mac, I’m going to avoid it whenever possible.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have the widest possible adoption of your new software, this is not the way to do it."
