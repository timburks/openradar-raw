    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22439067\n\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://22436692\n\nTimothy Perfitt26-Aug-2015 08:22 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMany “bless” options no longer work and no replacement options are available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDue to SIP, bless can no longer be used (“setboot”, “nextonly”, etc), and  no replacement is available.  systemsetup provides the ability to select an OS X volume for boot, but does not support the options of the bless command (nextonly, unmounted volumes, etc).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple would provide a mechanism for the same or similar options, or provide a notice (via man page or elsewhere) that these feature are being deprecated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nbless options do not work and systemsetup (or other tools) do not provide the same or similar functionality.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDisabling SIP restores prior behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAffected install count: hundreds at Montefiore Medical Center, thousands at affiliated Albert Einstein School of Medicine"
