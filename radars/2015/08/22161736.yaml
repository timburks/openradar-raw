    description: "Summary:\nError when setting single app mode when device is locked. (iOS 9 Beta 4)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nHave supervised device, sleeping (locked)\nEnable single App mode under, Action, Advanced\nChoose Safari\nAfter operation completes, unlock device\n\nExpected Results:\nDevice should unlock to Safari \n\nActual Results:\nDevice sits at lock screen and doesn’t respond to taps\n“Guided Access” error will appear on screen\n\nRegression:\nThis does not occur with iOS 8.0\n\nNotes:\nThis seems to be because of the new behavior where the lock screen isn’t displayed when using single app mode. If the device is siting at the home screen and the above steps are performed it works as expected. See attached log for errors on device."
