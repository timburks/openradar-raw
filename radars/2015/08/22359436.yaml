    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are really happy to see that app analytics is getting better and better. it becomes a very useful tool! \r\nWhen displaying data based on days, we would love to see that weekends are labeled different. See the attached image: our users are weekday-users. But we have to double-check against a calendar if the \"low-value-days\" are really weekends. If the axis label would be displayed different than the other values, it would be even more useable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen App Analytics for your App.\r\nSelect some value to Display. \r\nDisplay data of \"days\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the axes of the diagram, weekends are marked different to tell if a day is a sunday/saturday or a workday.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nall days are displayed the same way. we have to look up a day in the calendar to see if it is a weekday or not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ndoesnt matter (safari, chrome)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApp Analytics at 20.08.2015\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'appanalytics.png' was successfully uploaded."
