    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using dictation in my Watch app, and it's now failing every time I try to use it. I've been on watchOS 2 beta 5 since it was released two weeks ago, and when I first started using dictation, everything worked well. But now it never works. I'm using the following method to present the text input controller:\r\n\r\n- presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions:allowedInputMode:completion:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use -presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions:allowedInputMode:completion: somewhere in the code.\r\n2. Run the app on the Watch device and launch the text input controller\r\n3. Dictate some text\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect dictation to work and for text to appear on the dictation interface.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. No text appears on the dictation interface (even after waiting several seconds)\r\n2. After tapping Done, Apple Watch spins for a while before producing an error message: \"Dictation Failed. Apple Watch was unable to take dictation.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2 beta 5 (13S5325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on an Apple Watch device"
