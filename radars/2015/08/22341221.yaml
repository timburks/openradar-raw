    description: "## Summary:\r\n\r\nLocal Internet service provider (via Glass Fiber) supports IPv6 and hand out IPv6 adresses via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.\r\n\r\nIf I connect any of my Mac's directly to the Fiber to Ethernet Converter, everything works fine and I get an IPv6 address.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I make the same connection to my AirPort Extreme's WAN port, the AirPort Extreme does not 'receive' an IPv6 address. The relevant settings are as follows:\r\n\r\nConfigure IPv6: Automatically\r\nIPv6 Mode: Native\r\nEnable IPv6 Connection Sharing: Active\r\n\r\nFor other customers of my ISP, IPv6 seems to work fine with other home routers. Since everything also works fine when directly connected to a Mac, this must be an issue with the AirPort base stations.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect an AirPort Base Station to an ISP that hand out IPv6 adresses via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.\r\n2. Enable IPv6.\r\n\r\n## Expected Results:\r\n\r\nThe AirPort base station should receive an IPv6 address.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results:\r\n\r\nThe AirPort base station does not receive an IPv6 address."
