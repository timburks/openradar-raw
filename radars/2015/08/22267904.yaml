        Currently UIDevice.model only differentiate among different kinds of devices, like “iPhone”, “iPad”, “iPod touch”. But sometimes we need more detailed information like “iPhone 6” and “iPhone 6 Plus”.

        I hope UIDevice offer such information so that we don’t need to resort to code like this: https://github.com/InderKumarRathore/DeviceUtil/blob/master/DeviceUtil.m.
