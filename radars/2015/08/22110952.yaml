    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Slide Over facility is a great innovation but I think it needs to be rethought, perhaps requiring a multiple touch to activate. At present, it is far too easy for the user to accidentally activate the slide over, when all the user was trying to do was to turn a page etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a readable app, such as a newspaper, book\r\n2. Swipe in from right as if to turn the page\r\n3. Slide Over is accidentally activated\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould have preferred to just turn the page in the current app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSlide Over activates\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nios 9 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nipad air 1 wifi\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'image.png' was successfully uploaded."
