    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen `xcodebuild test` has to build (parts of?) the project, that build time counts against the 120 seconds allocated for the simulator to boot.\r\n\r\nOur CI build suddenly started failing because our project got larger, and we started hitting this time limit.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample application demonstrating the problem: https://github.com/e28eta/simulator-launch-timeout-includes-build-time\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an iOS application whose build takes > 120 seconds\r\n2. Clean all previously-built build products\r\n3. Use xcodebuild to run the 'clean' action (and only 'clean')\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should completely build, and then run the test bundle(s)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application builds, but it skips running the test bundles and reports that the tests failed.\r\n\r\nDuring the build process, xcodebuild logs \"xcodebuild[54591:624937]  iPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4, 6E35b. OS X 10.10.5, 14F27\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
