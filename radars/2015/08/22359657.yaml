    description: "Summary:\r\nThe BTLEServer process seems to get into a crash loop when the accessory registers with AMS. We are not sure why, because it does not always seem to happen.\r\n\r\nWe are registering for:\r\n- Player entity:\r\n-- Playback Info\r\n-- Volume\r\n(note we don't register for played name, because this appeared to be causing a crash loop as well)\r\n\r\n- Queue\r\n-- Index\r\n-- Count\r\n-- Shuffle Mode\r\n-- Repeat Mode\r\n\r\n- Track\r\n-- Artist\r\n-- Album\r\n-- Title\r\n-- Duration\r\n\r\nRebooting the phone seems to help \"fix\" the issue.\r\n\r\nAttached are 30 crash reports.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair and connect Pebble Time with FW v3.3. to the iOS device.\r\n2. Observe that Pebble Time registers for updates with AMS.\r\n3. Occassionally, the BTLEServer process crashes. iOS will reconnect and we'll end up in a loop.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBTLEServer should not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBTLEServer crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone7,1 (N56AP)"
