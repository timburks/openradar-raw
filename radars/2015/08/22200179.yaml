        Summary:
        Passing UIView’s initializer an expression that cannot be itself be initialized gives a misleading error, and an amusingly wrong hint.

        Trivial test case:

        let dimension = 44
        let view = UIView(frame: CGRectMake(10, 10, 10, dimension))
          // Error: Cannot invoke initializer for type ‘UIView’ with an argument list of type ‘(frame: CGRect)’
          //   Expected an argument list of type ‘(frame: CGRect)’

        The error complains that you can’t use (frame: CGRect) and suggests you instead use (frame: CGRect).

        This is a particularly confusing version of the general problem when you refactor a CGFloat from a parameter list into a variable. When you do this, the type gets inferred to Int instead of CGFloat and will fail to compile.

        This, however, will get an understandable error message:

        let rect = CGRectMake(10, 10, 10, dimension)
          // Error: Cannot invoke ‘CGRectMake’ with an argument list of type (Int, Int, Int, Int)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Paste the two lines of code above into a playground or sample project, and build.

        Expected Results:
        The error message complains that dimension has been inferred to be an Int and therefore it can’t create the CGRect.
          Bonus awesomeness: the compiler realizes that you meant to create a CGFloat and the code compiles.

        Actual Results:
        The error message complains that you should instantiate UIView with a CGRect instead of a CGRect.
