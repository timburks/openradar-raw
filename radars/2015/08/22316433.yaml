        I’ve attached a screenshot from watchOS 2 Beta 5 in which Siri responds with: “It doesn’t look like you have an app named ‘where is my phone’ on your Apple Watch.”

        Summary:
        Asking Siri “Where is my phone?” should ping my phone for me, the same way that tapping the icon on the settings glance does.
