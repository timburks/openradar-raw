    description: "Summary:\n\nStarting with iOS 9 beta 5 (Xcode 7 beta 5) CGPDFDocumentCreateWithURL returns a NULL CGPDFDocumentRef for password protected PDFs. The same code works fine on iOS 8.4 and was also working fine on previous iOS 9 beta versions. The function works as expected for all non-password protected PDFs on all iOS versions. This is a serious problem - one we can not work around easily. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nOpen the provided example project. Run it on iOS 9 and observe the assertion that gets triggered. Inspect the code in ViewController.m. Run the same on iOS 8.4 and youâ€™ll get no assertion hits. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nCGPDFDocumentCreateWithURL  should returns a valid non-null CGPDFDocumentRef for password protected PDFs, just like for non-password protected PDFs. \n\nActual Results:\n\nCGPDFDocumentCreateWithURL returns a valid null CGPDFDocumentRef for password protected PDFs.\n\nRegression:\n\niOS 9 beta 5 only"
