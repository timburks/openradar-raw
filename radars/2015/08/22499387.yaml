        Summary:
        Apple Music on iOS 8.4.1 very often will not play music. It eventually prompts user to sign up for Apple Music, when user already has signed up for a family plan. A reboot of the phone fixes the problem until it resurfaces again, usually within 24 hours.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use Apple Music as normal. This bug usually occurs when trying to play music after the app has not been used for several hours.

        Expected Results:
        Music plays

        Actual Results:
        Music does not play, app reports it is playing but the position marker does not move and the current position remains at 0:00. If the app is left alone, the user is prompted to subscribe to Apple Music.

        Regression:
        This has not worked properly yet.

        Notes:
        When attempting to visit “Music” in Settings to verify that indeed the user does have an Apple Music account, the settings app hangs and eventually is killed by the watchdog.
