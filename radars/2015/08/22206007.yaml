    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen implementing SSL pinning, it is useful to not enforce pinning when a private trust anchor, which was manually added to the OS' trust store, is detected in the server's certificate chain. \r\nThis is needed for allowing SSL connections through corporate proxies or firewalls and it is how Chrome operates in that scenario; stopping attackers with the ability to modify the OS (by adding certificates to the OS trust store, hooking SSL APIs, etc.) is not part of SSL pinning's threat model.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to detect if the certificate chain returned by a server was signed by private trust anchor (which was manually added to the iOS trust store) or by a system trust anchor (shipped with iOS).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be nice to have an API to differentiate OS trust anchors from private trust anchors.\r\n\r\nOn OS X, the list of private trust anchors can be retrieved using `SecTrustSettingsCopyCertificates()` with the\r\n`kSecTrustSettingsDomainUser` and `kSecTrustSettingsDomainAdmin` domain settings.\r\n\r\nThis logic is implemented in a tool I worked on: https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit/blob/master/TrustKit/Pinning/ssl_pin_verifier.m#L146\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo way to differentiate private trust anchors from system trust anchors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
