    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 8, it was possible to layout a UITableView in code so that it would fill the screen, including under a UINavigatonBar. Unless you set the automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets property of the UIViewController otherwise, the insets on the tableview were changed so that content would not appear below the navigation bar until the tableview was scrolled up.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 9, that functionality still appears to work when using storyboards, but it no longer works when adding the table view as a subview and applying constraints to it in code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the enclosed project on an iOS 8 device. Hit the plus sign to add content to the table view. Note that the content appears immediately below the navigation bar.\r\n2. Run the same enclosed project on an iOS 9 beta 4 device. Hit the plus sign to add content to the table view. Note that the content is hidden by the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the behavior to be the same on both iOS 8 and iOS 9\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 9, the content in the tableview are not offset by the height of the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI left a second storyboard with the TableView laid out there so it is easy to see that it works on iOS 9.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch, 5th generation running iOS 9; verified correct behavior on an iPhone 5s running iOS 8.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableViewTest.zip', 'iOS 8.4 - visible content.png' and 'iOS 9.0 beta 4 - content hidden.png' were successfully uploaded."
