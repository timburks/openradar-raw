    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a cell that has a variable height label for the first line. I found that using automatic dimension some of the cells are sized incorrectly causing this label to be truncated. If I reloadData in viewDidAppear, the size becomes correct.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Look at the two screen shots provided\r\n2) Notice that in one the bold label shows the ...\r\n\r\nThe screen shot with the earlier time stamp is without the workaround, the one with the later time stamps has the reloadData as discussed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should always be all lines visible of the text on the bold label\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome cells (even off screen) get an incorrect size. Only if you reload the cells AFTER the view has appeared on screen the size becomes correct.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI believe that this Stack Overflow question describes the same issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27842764/uitableviewautomaticdimension-not-working-until-scroll\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Simulator with iOS 8.4"
