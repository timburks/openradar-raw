    description: "Status bar is hidden by default in landscape on iPhone. iPhone 6 Plus supports launching app in landscape. Thus launch screen storyboard should support hiding status bar while launching in landscape on iPhone. Currently it seems impossible and causes UI jerk when transitioning from launch screen to real UI.\r\n\r\nLaunch sample app in landscape on iPhone 6 Plus to see the issue.\r\n\r\nSample code: http://cl.ly/3c3z3y2R2z1k"
