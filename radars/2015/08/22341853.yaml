        Summary:
        In El Capitan I noticed that in my app built on Yosemite using Xcode 6.4 that certain CoreImage filters were appearing to behave as passthrough filters and did nothing, the CIBloom filter is an example. I haven’t had time to go through all the filters to find out which ones work and which don’t.

        I wrote a swift playground using Xcode 7 testing the CIBloom filter in El Capitan and the filter was applied as expected.

        I rewrote the swift playground using Xcode 6.4 testing the CIBloom filter in El Capitan and the filter did not work as expected.

        The attached zip file includes both playgrounds. The folder names should make it clear which playground is intended for Xcode 6.4 and which for Xcode 7.

        The Xcode 6.4 playground highlights a problem that OS X applications built on Yosemite using Xcode 6.4 have.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Run the Xcode 6.4 playground in Xcode 6.4 on El Capitan, notice that the bloom filter just behaves as a passthru filter.


        Expected Results:
        I expect any application built in Xcode 6.4 on Yosemite to have the core image filters work as intended on El Capitan.

        Actual Results:
        Numerous core image filters behave as passthru filters in applications built using Xcode 6.4 on Yosemite.

        Regression:
        Works in Yosemite.
