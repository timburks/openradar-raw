    description: "Here’s a path to reproduce this from Mobile Safari and using SwiftKey as the third-party keyboard, but I think the same process works with other details:\n\n1) Open a new tab.\n2) Tap in the URL area to bring up the keyboard. \n3) Switch to SwiftKey.\n4) Enter a search term and hit Go.\n5) Tap in the URL area again to bring up the keyboard.\n6) Press and hold on the smiley-face key (left of space bar) and pick “Switch to other keyboard”.\n7) You’re back at the Apple keyboard, but the Dictation key is disabled."
