    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS Settings > General > Multitasking > Allow Multiple Apps turned off, it is possible to go forwards in Safari by swiping from the trailing (right) edge of the screen. However this gesture is blocked by iOS 9’s Slide Over feature. I think the forward gesture is really convenient.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure iOS Settings > General > Multitasking > Allow Multiple Apps is turned on.\r\n2. Open a webpage in Safari\r\n3. Follow a link on the page\r\n4. Tap the back button or swipe from the leading edge\r\n5. Swipe from the trailing edge (the right edge)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo go forward to the other page, with a tab-thingy shown on the trailing side of the screen. Swiping quickly again if we want to open Slide Over.\r\n\r\nThe forward gesture should always work in Safari, because it is so convenient. Maybe it would be nice if the app had a way to prevent the system from stealing the first right edge swipe (so two in quick succession are needed for Slide Over) similar to how hiding the status bar requires two swipes for Notification and Control Centre. Safari could even disable its override when going forward is not possible (which is quite often the case) so Slide Over is available with one swipe.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSlide Over is shown. It sometimes requires two swipes, I think depending on how recently Slide Over was used. But the forwards gesture is never handled by Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air (Wi-Fi + Cellular)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nNew information:\r\nApologies! I found the forward gesture works if dragging from anywhere except the centre of the screen. Still kind of confusing though."
