    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you view an album from My Music it is really bland on iPad. Meanwhile, on iPhone, colors from the album artwork are used to beautify the page and make it more exciting. Please do that for the iPad as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music app\r\n2. Go to My Music tab\r\n3. Select an artist\r\n4. Select an album\r\n5. See the blandness on iPad, while on iPhone it looks great.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA view controller that surprises and delights me with its use of color.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iPad, just a bland white screen with tracks and album artwork.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 Beta (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air, iPhone 6 Plus"
