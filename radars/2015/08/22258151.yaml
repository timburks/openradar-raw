        Summary:
        There are many instances where I find myself creating structs that are simply configuration objects for an API (such as `attributes` for `NSAttributedString`). Since only a subset of the configurations provided by the object need to be customized or provided at any one time, I generally write an `init` that takes all of the properties, but provides default values. This allows the user to only configure what they care about, i.e.:

        ```
        struct Options {
        	let foo: String?
        	let bar: Bool
        	let baz: Int

        	init(foo: String? = nil, bar: Bool = true, baz: Int = 0) {
        		self.foo = foo
        		self.bar = bar
        		self.baz = baz
        	}
        }

        let options = Options(bar: false)
        ```

        While I find this to be an incredibly powerful tool, thereâ€™s a whole lot of boiler plate going on, and `Options` only has 3 properties. It would be amazing if Swift could generate this init for me by inferring the default values in the initializer from the default values of the properties itself.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Attempt to compile the following:

        ```
        struct Options {
        	let foo: String? = nil
        	let bar: Bool = true
        	let baz: Int = 0
        }

        let options = Options(bar: false)
        ```

        Expected Results:
        This compiles, because the generated initializer can take `bar` and `bad` as optional parameters with default values.

        Actual Results:
        This does not compile, because the generated initializer is simply `Foo()`

        Regression:
        N/A
