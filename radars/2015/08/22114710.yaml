    description: "Summary:\r\nThe password to my yahoo mail account in Mail.app seems to have been lost for some reason. I have not changed it and verified that I can log in via the web. There is an error messages that says \"Login Failed,\" and is clickable, but nothing happens when I click on it. Also, the only indication that the problem is with yahoo mail is the \"broken\" icon that is in my mailboxes view pane on the left, by the yahoo account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCannot reproduce why Mail.app lost my yahoo credentials, however, you can view the \"login failed\" message by changing one of you mail passwords via the web and then opening Mail.app to see the error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- My mail should \"just work\" and not lose credentials by itself.\r\n- a \"login failed\" button/message should actually do something - prompt me for the new password again, give me a message, something.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking on \"Login failed\" does nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEl Capitan Developer Beta 5, Mail 9.0 (3073)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'loginfailed.png' was successfully uploaded."
