    description: "Summary:\r\nOften times, when I start Mail.app, the app would load the message list with the senders and with the subjects, but without the message's content preview. The content window then stays plain gray, even when I select a different message. At this point, Mail.app becomes unresponsive and I can't even quit it using âŒ˜Q or the menu entry. It does not fetch new messages in this state (at least, it does not display them, if there are any.) It appears as 'not responding' in the Force Quit Application window. So I have to force quit it. This doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes, I need to do this dance a few times until the program loads properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have not yet figured out in which circumstances this occurs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect Mail.app to start normally, display my messages and let me open them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Mail.app main window opens, lists an older set of messages with their senders and subjects and freezes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happens to me both on my MacBook Pro and my iMac, both running 10.10.5. The MBP is a late 2013 15\" Retina device; the iMac is a mid 2010 27\" device. I have a few mail accounts configured, including Exchange, Google Mail and Fastmail.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
