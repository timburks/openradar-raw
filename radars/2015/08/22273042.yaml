    description: "Summary:\r\nWith any project I've tried this with, tests pass or fail as expected but there is always an error stating \"Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot\". Screenshot of integration report attached. I was not able to find the log described in the error message. See Actual Results for details.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new single-view project\r\n2. Put project under git source control\r\n3. Add remote and push\r\n4. Create new bot and immediately integrate\r\n5. Try manually integrating\r\n6. Schedule integrating\r\n\r\nNote: Did not change the original tests, so there is still one regular test which passes and one empty performance test.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRelatively quick test process and all tests pass\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a long time, tests pass for only iPhone 4s and all other devices have \"Unknown Status\". 9 errors given similar to this:\r\nBot Issue: error. Uncategorized.\r\nIssue: Test target Xcode Bot TestTests encountered an error (Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1. If you believe.\r\nIntegration Number: 1.\r\nIntegration URL: https://home.jaywhitsitt.com/xcode/bots/4ED20BD/integrations\r\nDescription: Test target Xcode Bot TestTests encountered an error (Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1. If you believe this error represents a bug, please attach the log file at /Library/Developer/XcodeServer/Integrations/Integration-984f42e9dae192fa39f4b2c0521c9806/Session-2015-08-13_13:29:13-dI7JEE.log).\r\n\r\nThe contents of the /Library/Developer/XcodeServer/Integrations folder is only a folder named Caches. Within that folder, there are folders with UUIDs similar to the one in the error message, but not matching. I believe these are from other attempted integrations and only contain a DerivedData and Source folder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4 on client and server, OSX 10.10.4 on client and server, Server 4.1.3 (Build 14S1127)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am accessing this on my home network where home.jaywhitsitt.com points to an IP on my local network.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-08-13 at 1.24.30 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
