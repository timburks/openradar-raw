        Summary:

        I’m having a tricky time implementing NSAppTransportSecurity in a couple of my apps (at least without applying a global exception which defeats the point). They need to have insecure (http) access to the web but, in programatic terms, they only need that access in very specific parts of the app.

        If it were possible to define exceptions to NSAppTransportSecurity for specific classes or (possibly) frameworks it would allow me to enforce https access to the sites that I know about in advance for the majority of the app, but still make the rest of the app work.

        Notes:

        For context, this is the only code that needs unfettered access in two of my apps: https://github.com/sdarlington/WSLHTMLEntities

        The URLs passed in come from the user, so the app has no way of knowing whether a https version of the site exists (or, if it does, whether it’s the same as the http version).
