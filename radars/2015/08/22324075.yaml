    description: "Currently, comment threads in Bug Reporter are sorted like this: All Apple comments, then all developer comments.\r\nIt would be much more intuitive if comments would be sorted strictly by timestamp. Then I could actually read a thread with comments and responses chronologically.\r\n\r\nExample: rdar://21958439"
