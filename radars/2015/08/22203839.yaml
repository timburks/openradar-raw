    description: Formatting phone numbers can be extremely tricky, especially since the formatting varies widely between countries, and can even have multiple formats for each country. Typically, developers (usually from the US) will just ignore this complexity and assume either a 7 digit (like 555-5555) or 10 digit format (555-555-5555) and ignore everyone else. iOS already has a high quality formatter built into the system for typing numbers into the phone app, and many apps could take advantage of this.
