        Summary:
        We have a large test suite using the new UI testing tools in Xcode 7. Up until beta 6, our tests work as expected. Now with beta 6, we have test falling that are asserting on the hittable property of XCUIElement that previously passed

        I have verified we have elements that have zero width or height that are returning hittable as true, and we also have hidden views that are showing hittable as true.

        This is a major issue for our testing suite.
