    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile writing a test case using the new UI Testing tools, I found myself in the following situation:\r\n\r\n- I want to use a form to add an object to a collection of a data backing a table view;\r\n\r\n- I want to make sure that the new row representing the object renders the data I just input in the form;\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I queried the table view for the recently added row, then I queried the row for the static text that rendered the data. It would be very useful if the \"value\" property gave me the contents of a static text element (or other textual elements such as a text field or a text view). If there was another property that could be explicitly used to retrieve the text, even better.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a UI test case\r\n2. Retrieve a static text XCUIElement\r\n3. Try to get the text content of the element\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to have a String storing the text content of the static text element I retrieved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI got an empty String when I accessed the \"value\" property of the static text element.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 beta 6"
