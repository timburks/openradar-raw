    description: "Accessing 'fetchObjects' property on an instance of  NSFetchedResultsController is causing a crash on iOS 9 beta 5. It seems that accessing the property is not causing the crash every time but only if new objects has been inserted to the FRC instance recently.\r\n\r\nThe app is build with the latest AppStore Xcode Version 6.4 (6E35b), iOS SDK 8.4"
