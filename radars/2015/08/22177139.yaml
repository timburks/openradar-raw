    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen entity has to-many relationship it have generated methods like \"add<Entity>sObject\" or \"add<Entity>Objects\" and so on. When generating entities with selected Objective-C language they are presented in the \"Entity+CoreDataProperties\" file. But when generating classes in Swift there is no such methods declared even in Xcode 7 beta 5 when we're able to do this and we have to do this manually.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open project\r\n2. Generate entities for Objective-C\r\n3. See there are auto-generated methods presented in one of the files\r\n4. Remove all generated files\r\n5. Generate files for Swift\r\n6. See there is no such methods declared.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAuto-generated methods for to-many relationships should be presented in Entity+CoreDataProperties.swift file automatically after generating subclasses\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo methods presented in Swift files\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 5, iOS 9 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n10.10.4, Xcode 7 beta 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NewNSManagedExample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
