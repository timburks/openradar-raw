    description: "Summary:\r\nNote: use device with TouchID and a complex passcode to reproduce!\r\nThe problem arises when the user fails TouchID and then taps on \"Enter Passcode\" to authenticate via device passcode instead. I noticed that the screen that gets presented is plain white, and the passcode text-box does not show a value for the last character entered until it is masked (after a bout a one or two second delay), creating a strange user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. use a device with TouchID and complex device passcode\r\n2. authenticate in an app that utilizes TouchID with Keychain\r\n3. fail TouchID to make the \"Enter Passcode\" button appear\r\n4. tap on \"Enter Passcode\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to see immediate feedback when characters are typed.  It should display the character typed last for a couple of seconds (whatever the standard delay is) and then mask that character when the next one is typed, or the delay times out.  I also think that the screen presented lacks refinement, but that is just my personal opinion when I compare it to the native passcode screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI don't see immediate feedback when a character is types.  For example, on the very first character, the text-box is blank until the delay times out and the masked character appears."
