    description: "Summary:\r\nI created a sample project that demonstrates an issue I'm running into when creating a background session configuration. In the example, I have two different targets that compile the code. The first is an iOS framework with a minimum deployment target of iOS 8.0. The second is an OS X framework with a deployment target of 10.9.\r\n\r\nThe issue that I'm running into is that the #available check is not working properly. It appears that the #available(OSX 10.10, *) is not picking up the iOS OS properly with the *. See the code for more details and workarounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sample project.\r\n2. Compile the iOS framework.\r\n3. You will see the compiler warning.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo compiler warning would be thrown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompiler warning is thrown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AvailablilityCheck.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n--------- EDIT ---------\r\n\r\nIssue was resolved in Xcode 7.1 beta 2 - 7B75"
