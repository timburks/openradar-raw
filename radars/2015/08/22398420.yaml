    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate method \r\n- presentationControllerForPresentedViewController:presentingViewController:sourceViewController: is called, the presenting view controller is unexpectedly nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project, which implements presentationControllerForPresentedViewController:presentingViewController:sourceViewController: and asserts all the arguments are non-nil\r\n2. Run it\r\n3. Tap to present a view controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor no assertion to fail. I.e. for presented, presenting, and source to to non-nil, as they are documented as nonnull.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npresenting is nil.\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: the source is often good enough so we are currently basing decisions about what presentation controller to return by querying `presenting ?: source`.
