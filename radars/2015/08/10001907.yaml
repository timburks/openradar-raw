    description: "If I report a bug that is duplicate of an early one reported by others, I still want to know the progress. But now the only way to learn about the progress is by polling the bug reporter system, which is untimely, suboptimal and unreliable â€” I have to keep track of which bugs are fixed by myself.\r\n\r\nPlease build a notification system so all bug reporters including duplicate reporters are notified of the status changes of the bugs they are concerned about.\r\n\r\nThanks."
