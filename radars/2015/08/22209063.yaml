        Summary:

        When I receive an SMS from someone in my address book I would normally expect to see their name on the lock screen along with the message. In iOS 9b5, however, I only see the number. When I open the SMS in the Messages app the message it is correctly named.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        receive a text message from someone in my address book.

        Expected Results:

        Lock screen notification shows the name of the contact.

        Actual Results:

        Only a number is shown.

        Regression:

        This is not a problem in iOS 8.x. This is the first iOS 9 beta I’ve tried on the phone so I can’t say if this is new to this seed.
