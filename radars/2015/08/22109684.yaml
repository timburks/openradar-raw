    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently (iOS 8.4), Reminders displays reminders in the order that they were created and there is no option available to toggle the sort order to show reminders in the order of next occurrence.  If you have a number of reminders (especially if some have similar text) and at some point you need to edit an upcoming reminder, it is difficult to find the reminder in question when reminders are shown in the order created, which may appear to be effectively random by the time you need to edit/change the reminder.  If reminders could be sorted by time of the reminder (next occurrence in the case of repeating reminders), it would be much easier to find a given reminder (and this would have the added benefit of not having my reminders for next March showing at the top of my list of reminders all of the time).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0.  Have a list of reminders, ideally more than two screens full, including some with similar text but different dates.\r\n1.  Look for an upcoming reminder that you need to edit\r\n2.  Observe that reminders appear in an order that at first glance appears \"random\" rather than in the order that reminders will occur\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3a. Find a UI element in the Reminders UI to toggle the sort order of reminders to \"date of reminder/next occurrence\", OR\r\n3b. Find a preference in the Reminders section of Settings that allows setting the sort order of reminders to \"date of reminder/next occurrence\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Find no way to change the sort order of displayed reminders\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's possible that the right default in the majority of cases is to sort by date of reminder/next occurrence and that no preference or toggle is needed.  On the other hand, if you need to check/edit a reminder you (Siri!) just created, knowing you will find it as the last reminder in the list (the current behavior) is currently a time-saver.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 16GB, Verizon, using both Wi-Fi and Cellular"
