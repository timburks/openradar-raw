    description: "Summary:\nUINavigationBar currently always tries to present all navigation items, regardless of the available space. This can lead to unpleasant and confusing overlap between the navigation items on each side and the title. The issue has become even more pressing due to iOS adaptivity and the new iPad multitasking behavior (see attached screenshots). \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nConfigure a bunch of navigation items on both sides of the navigation bar and set a title. Now engage iPad multitasking and resize the app. \n\nExpected Results:\nThe navigation bar would conditionally hide items, if there is not enough room to fully display the (shorted title, remove title, remove bar items). \n\nActual Results:\nThe navigation bar items overlap. \n\nRegression:\nProblematic on iOS 9 with iPad multitasking.\n\nNotes:\nIn this case it is  had to manage the navigation bar items manually and respond to size classes, as we donâ€™t have access to the actual navigation item views so we could measure the needed and available space. This is something that needs to be solved on the system side."
