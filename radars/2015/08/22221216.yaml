        HKHealthStore allows for an app to subscribe to background delivery of any HKObjectType:

            func enableBackgroundDeliveryForType(_ type: HKObjectType,
                                       frequency frequency: HKUpdateFrequency,
                                  withCompletion completion: (Bool,
                                                          NSError?) -> Void)

            type - The type of data to observe. This object can be any concrete subclass of the HKObjectType class (any of the classes **HKCharacteristicType** , HKQuantityType, HKCategoryType, HKWorkoutType or HKCorrelationType).

        However, it is not currently possible to set up an HKObserverQuery for HKCharacteristicType as the type is restricted to the HKSampleType subclass of HKObjectType:

            init(sampleType sampleType: HKSampleType,
                               predicate predicate: NSPredicate?,
                           updateHandler updateHandler: (HKObserverQuery,
                                                  HKObserverQueryCompletionHandler,
                                                  NSError?) -> Void)

        I humbly ask that the HKObserverQuery API be revised to allow observer queries for HKCharacteristicType.

        I recognize that HKCharacteristicType values are not expected to change over time and the current API only allows for an app to ask for the “current” value (-dateOfBirthWithError:). However, it is very common for these values to be empty and if they are later filled in, apps that have access to these values should have a way of being informed. Observer queries seem like the perfect mechanism for the “date of birth was just entered” event.
