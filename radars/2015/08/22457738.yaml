    description: "If you search for \"[artist] [album]\" in iTunes, you get no results. An example would be the search query \"dr dre compton\"; while searching for \"dr dre\" OR \"compton\" will find this album, putting them both in one string makes the search fruitless.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nSearch your iTunes library for some combination of [artist] [album], for an artist and album you know to have.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\niTunes, obviously, finds the named album by the named artist.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\niTunes, against all odds, does not find the named album by the named artist."
