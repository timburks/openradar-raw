    description: "Summary:\nWe would like to embed a SFSafariViewController inside our app, with a custom navigation bar. \n\nCurrently if we embed the SFSafariViewController inside a UINavigationController, the toolbar of Safari VC is hidden, and we have no way to enable/disable Reader mode, nor can we refresh the browser.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a SFSafariViewController inside UINavigationController.\n2. The toolbar is hidden and we lost the ability to refresh and enter reader mode.\n\nExpected Results:\nWe should have programmatic access Reader mode and/or Reload/Navigation features.\n\nActual Results:\nNo programmatic access to Reader mode and/or Reload/Navigation features."
