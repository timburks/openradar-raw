    description: "I’m sure this is a dup, but I just wanted to make sure it was in the pipeline…\n\niBooks already uses the swipe-in-from-right gesture to advance from page to page. Currently (beta 5), both Slide Over and iBooks are responding to the gesture: the page turns as normal, but the sidebar tab also pops up briefly after every page turn, which is spurious and annoying. \n\nIn addition, if you DO want to activate the sidebar, it seems to be more difficult than normal to do so in iBooks."
