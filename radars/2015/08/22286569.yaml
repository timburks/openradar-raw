        Summary:
        Right now when using private browsing mode, each tab has it’s own session and no data (especially cookies) are shared between them. This is different than in Chrome, but I think I see the point for extra privacy. However, sometimes it would be really useful to open a new tab in a private browsing window and share the cookies from the tab I opened the link from via cmd+click.

        I always run into that with the developer forums: I’m logged in in one tab, browse the thread history, open all threads I’m interested in with cmd+click in a new tab. Only to see later, that in the opened tab, the forum doesn’t see me as a logged in user.
        There are many more uses cases though.

        I propose to use shift as an additional modifier: shift+cmd+click on a link in a private tab, and the newly opened tab shares browsing session.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * log into https://forums.developer.apple.com/welcome in a private browsing session
        * shift + cmd + click a link to a discussion

        Expected Results:
        * still logged in in the new tab showing the discussion

        Actual Results:
        * logged out in the new tab

        Regression:
