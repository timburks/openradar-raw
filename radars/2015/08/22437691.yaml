    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to use the GCD features introduced in iOS 8/Mac OS X 10.10 such as QoS overrides, dispatch_block_notify, and dispatch_block_create, you must create a wrapper block using dispatch_block_create. This creates extra side-table data in the normal block structure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use dispatch_block_create.\r\n2. Pass the created block to dispatch_block_notify.\r\n3. Run the code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpon calling dispatch_block_notify, the given function will be submitted to the given queue once the original block is called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUpon calling dispatch_block_notify, the application traps inside GCD with \"BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH: Invalid block object passed to dispatch_block_notify()\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o), swiftlang-700.0.57.3, clang-700.0.72\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe audit for dispatch_block_t appears to have removed @convention(block) in Beta 6. ARC, appears to copy the block such that the side-table is discarded.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs with any use a wrapped dispatch_block_t.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BlockProblems.playground.zip' was successfully uploaded."
