    description: "Summary:\r\nAs of Xcode 7 Beta 5, the Swift String class can no longer use built-in bridging to access the path related methods such as .pathComponents. In fact, all the methods/properties in the 'Working with Paths' section of NSString are NOT available to a Swift String class. The error given by the compiler is: 'stringByDeletingLastPathComponent' is unavailable: Use stringByDeletingLastPathComponent on NSString instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was not listed in the Release Notes and frankly just picking and choosing which NSString methods/properties are available from a Swift String class seems arbitrary. If the bridging can handle a Swift String in place of NSString, then why would some things not be available?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift String and attempt to use any of the path related methods/properties as listed under the 'Working with Paths' section of NSString documentation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMethods work exactly as they have up until Beta 5\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompiler returns an error that these methods/properties 'has been explicitly marked unavailable here'"
