    description: "Summary:\r\nA common, unfortunate realization upon removing my Watch from its charger is to put it on my wrist and jet out the door, only to realize that in fact the whole time it had been attached to the charger, it was not charging because I neglected to plug the USB end into a live electrical source.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great bit of UX finesse if the watch could, upon detecting magnetic attachment to a charger, make an aural alarm and present a notice to the user that it's not actually charging.\r\n\r\nThe battery cost of making the noise and displaying the visual alert seems justified as the user is likely in the process of trying to hook the watch up to a power source. In any case if the power source is live it should behave as it does today.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1.x or 2.0 beta.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
