    description: "SMLoginItemSetEnabled is documented to:\r\n\r\n> Enable a helper application located in the main application bundle's Contents/Library/LoginItems directory.\r\n\r\nBut it often doesn't work as expected.  It will often launch another copy of the agent elsewhere on the Mac, e.g. in the build or DerivedData folder, or in another copy of the app, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious issue, particularly for developers, but potentially also for users who like to keep multiple versions (in case the want to revert). Launching an agent from an older version of the app leads to incorrect behavior.\r\n\r\nI previously mentioned this issue on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27995970/smloginitemsetenabled-sometimes-silently-fails-to-launch-sandboxed-ui-helper\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have more than one copy of an app containing a login item.\r\n2. Call SMLoginItemSetEnabled for the login item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe login item contained within the app bundle (at Contents/Library/LoginItems) will be launched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes a login item from another copy of the app (or in the build folder) will be launched.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions of 10.10, and earlier I believe.  Untested on 10.11, but probably there too."
