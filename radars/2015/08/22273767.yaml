    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you instantiate many NSURLSessions with a background configuration while the app is running. Once backgrounded, when foregrounded again if another instance of NSURLSession with a background configuration is created, e.g.\r\n\r\nNSURLSessionConfiguration *backgroundSessionConfiguration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration backgroundSessionConfigurationWithIdentifier:backgroundSessionIdentifier];\r\n[NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:backgroundSessionConfiguration delegate:nil delegateQueue:nil]\r\n\r\nit will hang for several seconds. Use of the NSURLSession after instantiation is not required for the problem to occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch attached sample app on any device iOS 8 - 9. In -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:, 100 instances of NSURLSession with a background configuration are created.\r\n2. Lock the device.\r\n3. Unlock the device, and immediately start pressing the button repeatedly. Notice that the main thread is blocked because on -applicationDidBecomeActive, the app tries to instantiate an NSURLSession with a background configuration, which takes several seconds to complete.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe thread should not hang, and -sessionWithConfiguration: should return quickly. Its reasonable to expect that -sessionWithConfiguration: can be called on the main thread without hindering user experience.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-sessionWithConfiguration: blocks the thread for several seconds, depending on the number of NSURLSessions instantiated while the app was previously in the foreground.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 - iOS 9 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis does not occur with NSURLSessions that do not use a background session configuration.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46435935/URLSessionLocking.zip"
