        Summary:
        Lock screen QR code be separate from lock screen text.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        It would be nice if the QR code could be separate from the lock screen text. For example the lock screen text be the device name and the QR be the serial number. Currently the QR has to be the same data.

        Notes:
        This would be handy for when a serial number is used for lookup but the device name is more helpful to be displayed on the lock screen.
