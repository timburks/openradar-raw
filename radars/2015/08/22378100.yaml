    description: "Summary:\r\nI will often be listening to music and when I click on the ‘iTunes Store’ tab in iTunes, the music I’m listening to will stop. It’s pretty annoying. Then I have to go find what I was listening to again and play it again. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start playing music from Apple Music (often in the For you tab). \r\n2. Switch to the mini player. \r\n3. Use command-1 to open the main iTunes window again. \r\n4. Click on the iTunes Store tab (of Music)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect my currently playing music to continue playing. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the music will stop and I want to rage quit iTunes. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don’t think this would be as bad if the music just paused, but it stops and then I have no idea what I was listening to. Often I listen to music while I work and forget the playlist I’m listening to. \r\n\r\nI haven’t figured out the exact sequence of events that need to occur in order for this to happen, but it’s annoying."
