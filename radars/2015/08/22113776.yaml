        Summary:
        Given this line
            NSArray <UIView *> *array = @[@""];
        the compiler should warn that the array on the right hand side does not meet the generic-requirements of the array-variable. I know that this may be much harder to analyze when the assignment is not also the initialization of the array, but the compiler should be able to catch this simple case. Other cases, where the assignment may happen in different branches of the app should be catched by the analyzer.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Compile the attached program that contains the mentioned line of code - currently, it compiles without any issues. The project-settings are the default ones of a newly created Xcode 7-project.

        Expected Results:
        There should be a compiler-warning to catch the type-mismatch, and the analyzer should be capable of recognizing more complex mismatches.

        Actual Results:
        No compiler-warning, no analyzer-result.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
