    description: "##Description\r\nAs this support document (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202788) outlines, touching an Apple TV with an iOS device (using iOS 7 or later with Bluetooth enabled) should automatically set up the following: 1) Wi-Fi network and password; 2) iTunes Store account; and 3) Language and region format preferences.\r\n\r\nHowever, this set up process does not complete any of the steps listed above, even though the iOS device successfully cycles through the prompts in the order listed. Users still need to manually input that information after following these instructions. This bug makes for a frustrating experience, particularly for first-time users.\r\n\r\n##Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Plug in a new or restored Apple TV to initiate the set up process.\r\n2. Follow the on-screen instructions and tap Apple TV with an iOS device.\r\n3. Cycle through the following prompts on iOS device (listed in sequential order): a) Type Apple ID and Password; b) Enable Apple TV to remember Apple ID; and c) decide whether or not to Send Data to Apple.\r\n4. Apple TV displays an Automatic Setup screen (as seen in Step 7 of the support document above).\r\n5. Apple TV reverts to the initial on-screen instructions, as described in Step 2.\r\n\r\n##Expected Results\r\nTouching an Apple TV with an iOS device running iOS 7 or later with Bluetooth enabled should automatically set up the following: 1) Wi-Fi network and password; 2) iTunes Store account; and 3) Language and region format preferences.\r\n\r\n##Actual Results\r\nApple TV fails to automatically initiate this set up process, and instead reverts to its initial on-screen instructions. Users are only able to manually input all of their information to move forward with the set up process, even after repeated attempts to initiate Automatic Setup.\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\nApple TV (3rd generation) with Software v.7.2\r\niPhone 5 with iOS 8.4"
