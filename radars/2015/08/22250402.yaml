        Summary:
        I have a single Apple Music track that shows up as “Matched” instead of “Apple Music” for its iCloud status. I can’t download it, or delete it from my library

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Vaguely, as this happened for one track and I don’t want to try with others. I tried to think of all pertinent things I’ve done, and the order isn’t 100% accurate

        1. Pre-Apple-Music, subscribe to iTunes Match
        2. Sign up for Apple Music through iTunes
        3. Turn on iCloud Music Library
        4. Add an Apple Music track to your library and download it
        5. Sync with multiple iOS devices
        6. Update my iCloud Music Library
        7. Sign out of my account in iTunes
        8. Sign back in
        9. Delete local download of track
        10. Repeat steps 6-8
        11. Delete track from iCloud library to try to start over
        12. Download or play the track

        Expected Results:
        The track should be listed as “Apple Music” instead of “Matched”, and then 11 or 12 does what it should, deleting the track from my library or playing/downloading it

        Actual Results:
        11 has no effect, 12 produces an error message: “This item cannot be downloaded. The item you have requested is not available for download”
