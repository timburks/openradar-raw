        I’ve noticed that iTunes is no longer syncing books correctly to my iPad. The process is that I add a new book to iBooks on OS X, then select iPad -> Books in iTunes and check it off to be synced, then hit Apply or Sync. iTunes appears to do a normal sync, and sometimes I even catch a status message of the form “copying item X of Y: Book Title”. The sync completes without apparent issue.

        After the sync, the books remain checked within iTunes. However, if I then go to iBooks on the iPad, the newly-added books do not appear. Books that were already on the iPad remain there.

        If I restart iTunes and reconnect the iPad, the Sync Books pane reflects the situation accurately: books that are actually on the iPad are checked, and the new books that were supposed to have been synced are now unchecked again.
