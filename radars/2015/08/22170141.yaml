    description: "Summary:\r\nThe bless command is failing to update the EFI nvram setting to boot from the restored system disk when using the '--setBoot' option.\r\n\r\nThis has previously worked on 10.10.\r\n\r\nWithout this ability to change the boot drive via sudo and bless we will not be able to upgrade our 700 lab Macs to OS X El Capitan when it's publicly available, which means that we will not be purchasing any Macs. The reason we need this is that every summer we restore a based clean system disk image to all lab Macs and then they apply the appropriate software packages for the next academic year.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Restore a system disk image that was created and scanned for restore with Disk Utility.\r\n2. Run the bless command with sudo rights and the --setBoot argument, and it fails:\r\n\r\nCB108-82:~ justin$ sudo bless -folder '/Volumes/Mac HD/System/Library/CoreServices' --bootefi '/Volumes/Mac HD/usr/standalone/i386/boot.efi' -setBoot\r\nCould not set boot device property: 0xe00002bc\r\nCB108-82:~ justin$ echo $?\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bless command should be exit cleanly and the Mac should boot from the new blessed disk volume.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bless command fails with a terse error message of \"Could not set boot device property: 0xe00002bc\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A244d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has a huge impact on us and if we don't have another way to change the start up disk via a command line interface method (which must be automated) I fear that we won't be able to further support Macs  for our student computing labs.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MacBook Pro.spx' and 'Screen Shot 2015-08-06 at 10.17.56 AM.png' were successfully uploaded."
