        Summary:
        When you restore an iOS device from iCloud, it restores all apps from the top left icon across, with no prioritization. This is frustrating because it can be hours before an app in your dock is usable.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Restore an iOS device with hundreds of apps, some of which are buried in a folder, some of which are not, and some of which are in the dock.

        Expected Results:
        The phone restores the apps in my dock first, then my home screen, then folders.

        Actual Results:
        Apps in folders restore first if they’re in the top left. This is particularly bad if you have “junk” folders near the top of your screen, like CPG Grey does: http://relayfm.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Cortex/Episode%20001/Grey's%20Homescreen.PNG
