This application, or a library it uses, is using an invalid context  and is thereby contributing to an overall degradation of system stability and reliability. This notice is a courtesy: please fix this problem. It will become a fatal error in an upcoming update.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.5 (14F27)\r\nDarwin 14.5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUnsure if additional, 3rd party preference panes could be the blame or not, but if it matters the ones I have installed are:\r\n1.
