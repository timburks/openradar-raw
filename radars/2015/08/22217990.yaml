    description: "Summary:\r\nFor organizations that have multiple Developer Program accounts (University, Standard Company, & Enterprise), they all appear in Xcode's team field with the same name. This makes it difficult to select the correct team for any given project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enroll your University (\"Apple University\" for example) in the University, Standard Company, and Enterprise Developer Programs.\r\n2. Invite an arbitrary user to all three programs.\r\n3. Install Xcode.\r\n4. Launch Xcode and in the accounts preference pane, login with the Apple ID you used in step 2.\r\n5. Create a new iOS project.\r\n6. In the application target, select the team that represents your Enterprise account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to identify which teams represent which programs. Something like what is presented when I login to the Member Center:\r\nApple University (University Program)\r\nApple University (Enterprise Program)\r\nApple University (Standard Program)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSince all the selections have the same name, I can't tell which one to choose.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4 (6E35b) & OS X 10.10.4 (14E46)"
