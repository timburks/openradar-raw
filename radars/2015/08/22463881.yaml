    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile using Xcode 7 beta 6 7A192o, a seemingly invalid jpg image crashes\r\nactool with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'IBPlatformToolFailureException', reason: 'The agent crashed\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Switch to the Xcode 7 beta 6 command line tools\r\n2. In the example project run the crash.sh script\r\n3. Wait for actool to crash\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe xcassets file should be compiled correctly each time.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nactool occasionally crashes (nearly 100% on CI)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- See the included crash.log for the crash\r\n- If the crash doesn't happen after a reasonable amount of time, it\r\n  typically happens very soon after ibtool is started. Kill ibtoold\r\n  with: `pgrep ibtool | xargs kill -9` and run the script again\r\n- This jpg has been included in our project with no issue for a long\r\n  time\r\n- We still don't see anything wrong with this file, but re-exporting it\r\n  solved the problem"
