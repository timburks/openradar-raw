    description: "Summary:\r\nA popover presented from a navigation item appears normal, until the user rotates the device from landscape, to portrait back to landscape when in a multitasking environment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Display a popover from a navigation item in an landscape iPad application that is currently the Primary app in a multitasking environment.\r\n2. Rotate the iPad to Portrait\r\n3. Rotate the iPad back to landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe popover arrow is drawn normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe popover arrow appears away from the navigation item that invoked the popover. Also, some extraneous drawing occurs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 13A4325c (beta 5)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a screenshot of the issue, and a quick project that shows this. Launch the project in landscape, slide in a secondary app, rotate to portrait and back to landscape.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PopoverIssue.zip' and 'Simulator Screen Shot Aug 10, 2015, 1.07.07 AM.png' were successfully uploaded."
