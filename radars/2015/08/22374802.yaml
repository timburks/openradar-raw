    description: "Summary:\r\nPrior to iOS 8.4, when selecting multiple items using MPMediaPickerController the selected items remained highlighted to indicate selection. Additionally, it was not possible to select an item multiple times. \r\n\r\nAs of iOS 8.4, selecting an item simply highlights it for a brief period of time and the user can select the same item multiple times without being  aware that she has already selected the item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement an instance of MPMediaPickerController (init with MPMediaTypeMusic)\r\n2. Set \"allowsPickingMultipleItems\" to \"YES\"\r\n3. Present the controller modally and try selecting an item\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSelected item should remain highlighted to indicate selection and it should not be possible to select an item multiple times\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSelected items are not reflected (aside from a brief highlight - dehighlight) and it's possible to select an item multiple times mistakenly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s"
