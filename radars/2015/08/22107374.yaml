    description: "For quick cave man's debugging sessions with NSLog() it would be nice if messages in the debugger output of Xcode would somehow (e.g. by a different color) be marked when they were emitted from the main thread. Thread number \"303\" used to be a strong indicator for being the main thread, but that stopped working some time ago:\r\n2014-02-06 16:18:26.309 MyApp[1286:303] Message from NSLog called on main thread"
