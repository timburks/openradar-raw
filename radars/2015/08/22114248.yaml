    description: "I’m not sure when iOS playgrounds stopped working for me, but opening one is now consistently producing a back-end crash. The “running…” spinner shows for about 5 seconds, and then the playground reports \"Playground execution terminated because the process stopped unexpectedly.\" \n\nThis happens even for newly-created playgrounds. OS X playgrounds seem to be OK. 100% reproducible.\n \nI've tried deleting Xcode's derived data folder, but that didn't seem to help. I also reinstalled Xcode 7 beta 4 from the dmg file, same behavior.\n\nPlease let me know if there’s any additional info I can provide."
