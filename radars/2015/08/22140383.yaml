    description: "Summary:\r\nThe current FV2 enabling process for AD users requires that admins either interactively enter additional user credentials directly, via pre-populated plist or directly by coordinating setup w/ new user.  Valid AD accounts should be automatically allowed to unlock FV2 boot drives after initial login.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Prepare an OS X 10.9+ Mac\r\n2. Bind to Active Directory with mobileaccounts enabled\r\n3. Encrypt Mac w/ FV2 using Institutional and Individual recovery keys\r\n4. Enable FV2 for current or next user\r\n5. AD user A logs into Mac and can unlock FV2 boot disk\r\n6. Ask AD user B to log into Mac\r\n7. Reboot Mac\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAD user A is able to unlock FV2 boot drive.  After first successful login, AD user B is subsequently able to unlock FV2 boot drive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAD user A is able to unlock FV2 boot drive--as are any local accounts created after encrption--but AD user B (or any AD users) must be manually added to allow FV2 list, which requires credential sharing or manual effort.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.10.5 (14F19a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nImpacted Mac portable count: 1064  Desktops are largely excluded from our FV2 policy, but Mac Minis may require FV2 soon (Mac Mini count: 200)."
