    description: "Summary:\r\nPassword entries in Terminal now has a keychain icon to indicate that the password field will not display any password. However, since not displaying the password is common knowledge, the icon can be used instead to select a keychain autofill. This would actually be a very useful feature if implemented (for SSH, FTP, etc) but will need to be heavily regulated in case unwanted access to terminal was obtained.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A235d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
