        Summary:
        When developing multiple applications that collaborate in a split-screen multitasking environment on iOS 9, it can be helpful to know the actual application frame of the current application, to know if the app is on the left side or the right side of the screen. I would have expected [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame] or [… bounds] to be returned with a non-zero origin if it was running on the right-side of the screen.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Acquire an iPad Air 2 with iOS 9
        2. Open any application
        3. Open my own application from the right of the screen, and tap the divider to make it a real split-screen app
        4. Query [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds] or [… applicationFrame]

        Expected Results:
        5. Receive the result {{704,0},{320,768}}

        Actual Results:
        5. Receive the result {{0,0},{320,768}}
