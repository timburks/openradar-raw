    description: "Summary:\r\nWith OS X El Capitan, you can no longer bless boot to a netboot server, without first adding the netboot servers ip address at an allowed list via recovery mode.\r\n\r\nCurrently we use the Casper suite to manage our lab fleet of ~1500 iMacs and Mac Pros and staff fleet of ~2000 machines.\r\n\r\nThe lab fleet is reimaged every year and is spread across many network subnets and campuses. We remotely send the bless boot command to netboot the machines across subnets to different ip’s depending on the building and/or campus they are located.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. sudo bless --netboot --booter \"tftp://$IP_ADDRESS/$NBI/i386/booter\" --kernelcache \"tftp://$IP_ADDRESS/$NBI/i386/x86_64/kernelcache\" --options \"rp=http://$IP_ADDRESS//$NBI/NetBoot.dmg\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEFI set successfully, followed by successfully netbooting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCould not set boot device property: 0xe00002bc\r\nCan't set EFI\r\n\r\nWhich now happens unless the Netboot server ip is set using csrutil via recovery mode.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is huge problem because it impacts our ability to automate imaging of our lab fleet, as we do that while they are booted into OS X, and have no way of automating the process of adding the allowed netboot ip addresses when booted into recovery mode.\r\n\r\nPlease consider either removing the requirement of white listing ip’s or allow ip’s to be added via csrutil while booted into OS X."
