    description: "Summary:\r\nTwo of our team's builds are stuck in the Processing state in iTunes Connect. The older has been there for at least 20 hours now. I'd expect processing to take 30 minutes like it did for our previous builds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Archive the project in Xcode as Version 0.3 build 2\r\n2. Upload to iTunes Connect\r\n3. Login to iTunes Connect and observe \"Processing\" state\r\n4. Wait 20 hours\r\n5. Login to iTunes Connect and observe \"Processing\" state\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect the build to be processed and show up in the Version 0.3 section like our previous 0.3 build.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build is stuck in Processing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite (10.10.5)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe've done two builds this way now, and both are stuck in Processing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7 beta 6"
