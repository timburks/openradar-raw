    description: "Summary:\r\nMany families have historically had a single shared photo library. When I take pictures with the family DSLR, my photos get added to the library. When my wife takes pictures with her point-and-shoot, the photos get added to the library. When either of us take pictures with our iPhones, the photos get added to the library.\r\n\r\nWhen we \"work\" on our library, adding Faces, organizing events, correcting incorrect information, tagging photos with keywords, etc., we do that in one central shared library.\r\n\r\nNow, that library exists on iCloud with iCloud Photo Library, which is great. Except that my wife and I cannot both access the library. If we both use the same AppleID, we can access the library on multiple devices, but likes and comments are tied to a single AppleID, as well as lots of other things if one of the devices is an iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe Family Album seems to (kind of) be intended for this use case, but it only makes sense if we're each keeping our own separate libraries (which does not make sense).\r\n\r\nI can create an account on my wife's Mac that is connected to my AppleID, and let her log in as that user (to deal with the photo album there), but that's a hacky workaround.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a library with Photos, connected to iCloud Photo Library.\r\n2. Get married.\r\n3. Merge your wife photos into your library, so you don't have to maintain separate libraries.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy wife can access our shared library with her AppleID.\r\nI can access our shared library with my AppleID.\r\nIn the future, our children can access our shared library with their AppleIDs.\r\nWe can each make additions, deletions, edits, etc., as shared owners of the library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can access our library with my AppleID.\r\nMy wife (and everybody else) cannot access the library with their AppleIDs."
