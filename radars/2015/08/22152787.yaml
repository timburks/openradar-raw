        Summary:
        - The “this app has been updated” dot has a visually displeasing effect on the home screens of users with lots of apps installed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Download several apps that you use infrequently.
        2) Use your device for awhile and let the apps that you’re not using often get updated.
        3) Observe your home screen.

        Expected Results:
        - God’s In His Heaven, All’s Right With The World (tm)

        Actual Results:
        - My home screen has lots of dots on it, and truncated app names for apps that I’m not interested in using any time soon, but want to keep installed. The only way to clear the dots is to launch the apps. See attached real-usage screenshot.

        Notes:
        Yes, this is one of my back pages of apps and as such is fugly and unorganized.
