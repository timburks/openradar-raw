        Our apps at JoyTunes listen to an acoustic piano using the iPad’s/iPhone’s microphone while playing background music through the device’s speakers.

        If the user wants to play the background music to bluetooth speakers, the audio routing of the session automatically wants to use bluetooth for input as well. This means our MusicSense recognition engine won’t work well (optimized for use with the device’s internal mic).
        Therefore we had to disable bluetooth speakers for our apps.

        It would be awesome if there would be a way in AVAudioSession to set the preferred input to the device’s microphone and allowing the preferred output to go to bluetooth speakers, which currently seems impossible.
