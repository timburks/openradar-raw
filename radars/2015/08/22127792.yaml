    description: "The feature in iOS 9 that provides possible Caller ID Information from phone numbers found in emails would work great with Core Spotlight indexes as well.\r\n\r\nWith iOS 9 and Core Spotlight it is possible for a developer to index an item with the kUTTypeContact content type, provide a name and a list of phone numbers. \r\n\r\nlet attributeSet = CSSearchableItemAttributeSet(itemContentType: kUTTypeContact as String)\r\n    attributeSet.title = name\r\nattributeSet.phoneNumbers = [phone]\r\n\r\nIt would be an amazing user experience if the caller ID screen would show the matching Spotlight result for this phone number. This would allow CRM applications to index their contact database and provide users with the information they need when one of their contacts calls them. Further more, when the call is ended the Spotlight search results could be presented so that a user can quickly jump to the record to to leave notes or some other type of follow up. \r\n\r\nThis could be further extended to indexed web results from the Maps database for business phone numbers."
