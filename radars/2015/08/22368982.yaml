    description: "Summary:\r\nI recently moved around some swift files in my project for better organization. This changed the .xcproj file. On building, my Xcode integration bots shows the following kind of swift errors:\r\n\r\nBot Issue: error. Swift Compiler Error.\r\nIssue: Use of unresolved identifier 'MySwiftClass'.\r\nFile: MtSwiftClassUser.swift.\r\nIntegration Number: 224.\r\nIntegration URL: https://xcodebotserver/xcode/bots/D6BF719/integrations\r\nDescription: Use of unresolved identifier 'MySwiftClass'.\r\nCommitters: Introduced 10 integrations ago.\r\n\r\nHowever the bot did create an archive.\r\n\r\nWe've tried cleaning the project, deleting derived data etc. but it does not seem to help.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with swift files. Add to source control.\r\n2. Create new Groups and move files physically to new folders on file system. \r\n3. Verify that a diff on the project shows that file locations have changed. Commit updates to source control.\r\n4. Close Xcode and open project again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMoving files around should not really matter. If a swift file uses a swift class in a moved file, it should be able to locate it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSymbol table gets corrupted. Swift code with references to the moved code shows errors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.4.1 & 10.10.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated issue: http://swift-error.com/ios/swift-xcode-autocomplete-stopped-working-symbol-not-found/\r\n\r\nused following steps to mitigate:\r\n1) rm -r ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode\r\n2) restart Xcode\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
