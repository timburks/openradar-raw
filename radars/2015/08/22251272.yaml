        Summary:
        It would be useful if the new NSDataAsset would expose a readonly `path` property.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        The path property would return a NSString to the path of that asset on disk.

        Actual Results:
        The property does not exist.

        Regression:
        This would allow developers to store things like sql databases (that are initialized by their path, not their data) in Asset Catalogs.
