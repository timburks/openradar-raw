        Summary:

        In the new NetworkExtension framework, NEHotspotHelper's `supportedNetworkInterfaces` returns `[AnyObject]` in Swift. Beside this return there is also this comment:

        ```
        public class func supportedNetworkInterfaces() -> [AnyObject] /* of NEHotspotNetwork */
        ```

        Making me thing that this return type should be annotated to correctly return `[NEHotspotNetwork]`. Also the documentation comment for this function has this:

        ```
        * @return
        *   nil if no network interfaces are being managed,
        *   non-nil NSArray of NEHotspotNetwork objects otherwise.
        ```

        Which seems to conflict with the return type as well. This comment implies that this return value could be nil, although it seems like that is impossible. I assume it would return `[]` in this case.

        Expected Results:

        - The return type should be correctly annotated to not return `[AnyObject]`
        - The documentation comment should be updated to reflect the actual possible return values of this function.
