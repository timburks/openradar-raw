    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a case when function that accepts UnsafeMutablePointer can change value of immutable variable declared with let. The following code will compile and run successfully. It will show 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nfunc bug(x: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>) {\r\n    x.memory += 1\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc test() {\r\n    let x: Int\r\n    x = 1\r\n    bug(&x)\r\n    print(x)\r\n    bug(&x)\r\n    print(x)\r\n}\r\n\r\nNothing must be able to change value of let, so I consider this behavior as bug.\r\n\r\nTo compare, if you'll try to assign 'x = 2' after 'x = 1' line, compilation will fail with \"Immutable value 'x' may only be initialized once\". But for some reason calling 'bug(&x)' is allowed to mutate immutable value.\r\n\r\nAlso, the strange thing is if I replace two lines 'let x: Int' and 'x = 1' by 'let x: Int = 1', compilation also fails with \"Cannot pass immutable value as inout argument: 'x' is a 'let' constant\" on lines where 'bug(&x)' is called. This is correct behavior, and the same error message should appear in the very first case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 7.0b6 (7A192o).\r\n2. Create a playground for iOS, paste my code snippet in playground. Code compiles successfully.\r\n3. Look at output: \"2\\n\" and \"3\\n\" are printed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompilation error should occur. It should be \"Cannot pass immutable value as inout argument: 'x' is a 'let' constant\" on lines where 'bug(&x)' is called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCode compiles fine, immutable value is changed after its initialization.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0b6 (7A192o), OS X 10.10.5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSwift 2.0, Xcode 7.0b6 (7A192o), OS X 10.10.5, building for iOS 9.0.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
