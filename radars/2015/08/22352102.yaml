        The current documentation is poor in many ways:

        - Core Spotlight classes (e.g. CSSearchableItemAttributeSet) don't shop up in Xcode's documentation browser (only on developer.apple.com and in the header files)
        - Setting relatedUniqueIdentifier for a NSUserActivity item prevents indexing (rdar://21958439). It's totally unclear why and how to deal with this.
        - It is unclear which CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.contentType should be used in order to have properties from the different CSSearchableItemAttributeSet categories such as CSPlaces or CSDocuments show up in search results.
        - It is unclear if properties from different CSSearchableItemAttributeSet categories may be mixed.
        - Generally, it's not documented which properties actually are displayed in search results at all.
