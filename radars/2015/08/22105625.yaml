        Summary:
        The battery status when having the MacBook Pro running on battery always shows "20:00 Remaining” and doesn’t update.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * unplug Mac
        * click the battery icon in the menu bar

        Expected Results:
        Accurate remaining time on battery shown

        Actual Results:
        20 hours remaining shown

        Regression:
        This was more accurate with 10.10

        Notes:
        Maybe you folks did magic and I really do have 20 hours on my battery? If so, Elon Musk would like to talk to you.
