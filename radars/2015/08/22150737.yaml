    description: "Summary:\r\nUse of metadata (e.g https://schema.org/GeoShape) to enable indexing of, e.g.: Points of interest and curated walking routes from mapping applications. Looking at the pre-release docs for search indexing, GeoShape is not currently a supported schema as of yet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create web content with GeoShape meta tags\r\n2. Wait for Applebot to crawl site.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBot should index content appropriately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBot will not index GeoShape content."
