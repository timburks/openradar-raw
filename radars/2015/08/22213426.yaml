    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple Music iOS app loses its state whenever it is terminated by the user or the system. When relaunching Music, you are treated to a screen cap that makes you think everything is as you left it, but then it fades away to wherever it thinks you should be. I've uploaded a video that demos this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Music\r\n2. Navigate to a playlist or other area of app\r\n3. (Optionally) Start music playing\r\n4. If any music is playing, stop it. The app shouldn't be kept alive in the background.\r\n5. Exit the app\r\n6. Launch other memory heavy apps and/or allow enough time to pass for the system to terminate the Music app\r\n7. Relaunch the music app\r\n8. You should see a screen cap of wherever you left off and the song that was playing.\r\n9. Then that screen cap will fade away to reveal a different location in the app and likely a different song in the queue.\r\n\r\nIf these steps don't work, then the app wasn't terminated in the background. Repeat and really dig into step 6. Heavy games and TheVerge.com website did it for me on an iPhone 6.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter completing the steps above I should always, and without fail, be returned to my last location in the app and I should be able to continue listening to what I was previously listening to exactly from where I left off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the Music app is terminated, I have to navigate back to where I was and guess at what I was listening to previously.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNo special configuration. I'm using a non-jailbroken iPhone 6, with iOS 8.4. I browsed Theverge.com and launched Kingdom Rush while the Music app was in the BG to use up memory."
