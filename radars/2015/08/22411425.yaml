        Summary:
        Arabic is a supported localization language for iOS apps, but is not available as a choice for iTunes Connect app metadata. Weâ€™re developing an app for Kuwait, where Arabic is the official language, and we currently have no way to correctly label the store metadata.

        The only workaround appears to be to use Arabic screenshots, and smash English and Arabic text into single fields. Considering the languages use opposite directionality, this could be called inelegant.
