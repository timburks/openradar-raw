    description: "Application Loader gets stuck on \"Sent API Usage. Waiting for response...\" step. It waits for more than 10 minutes, and fails. This bug does not occur on a different computer on the same network(home network) or my computer with cellular network shared from my phone.\r\n\r\nMy modem or computer does not have any kind of firewall enabled and all ports are available. I tried checking/unchecking options from settings and kept DAV as the only option."
