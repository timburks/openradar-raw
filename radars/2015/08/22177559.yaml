        Steps to Reproduce:
        (Check out sample project)
        Create generic class that inherits from UIVC:

        class GenericViewController<GenericType>: UIViewController {
        }

        And a subclass that specializes it:

        class SpecificViewController: GenericViewController<String> {

        }

        Reference SpecificViewController (which is not generic anymore) as the type of a controller in a storyboard.

        Expected Results:
        View Controller class is instantiated.

        Actual Results:
        I see “ Unknown class _TtC10ModuleName21ViewControllerClass in Interface Builder file.” in the console, and a plain UIViewController gets instantiated instead.
