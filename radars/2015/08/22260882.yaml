    description: "Apple Developer Relations\r\n21-Aug-2015 03:15 AM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. \r\n\r\nThe open or closed status of the original bug report your issue was duplicated to appears in the yellow \"Duplicate of XXXXXXXX\" section of the bug reporter user interface. This section appears near the top of the right column's bug detail view just under the bug number, title, state, product and rank.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please update your report directly here: http://bugreport.apple.com/.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I enter two alerts when creating an upcoming event in iOS Calendar app, the alert times are swapped such that the first alert would be closer to the event than the second alert.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new event in Calendar\r\n2. Change the alert time to anything, say, 1 day\r\n3. Enter a second alert using a closer time to the event, for example, 1 hour\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected result is that the first alert will be triggered 1 day away from the event and the second alert will be triggered 1 hour away from the event.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActual result is that upon entering the above the first alert will be set to 1 hour and the second alert will be set to 1 day.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThis has been happening since iOS 8.3 and possibly earlier.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCurrently no workaround and I have to enter/delete/re-enter until the alerts stick."
