    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring development of a new product we noticed that often, the didDiscoverServices callback is never called, after which point a device reboot is required to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWe have not found a way yet to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter calling -discoverServices: on a CBPeripheral, the -peripheral:didDiscoverServices: should always get called eventually either when successfully completing the discovery or when failing (possibly due to a timeout for the whole process).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe -peripheral:didDiscoverServices: delegate method did not get called at all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame issue: https://openradar.appspot.com/20499679\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
