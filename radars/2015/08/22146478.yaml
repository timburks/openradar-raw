    description: "Summary:\r\nOS X Calendar does not allow an Exchange user to set their default calendar sharing permission.  This functional gap in OS X Calendar is an important omission for a calendar application on Exchange.  If a user needs to change their default calendar share in the organization (whether more restrictive or permissive), the user must instead move to Outlook Web Access, Outlook for Windows, or MacOutlook.\r\n\r\nAt my organization of 300, a senior executive asked staff to change their default sharing permissions from “Free/Busy” to “Free/Busy, Title, Subject, and Location”.  As a multiplatform organization, a number of staff use Macs, with Mail and Calendar.  These folks are unable to accommodate the request with their preferred native tools.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, OS X Calendar has never offered this functionality on Exchange."
