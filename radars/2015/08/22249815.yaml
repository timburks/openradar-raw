        Summary:
        Occasionally, when playing a podcast, the podcast will stop playing for no reason at all. Usually when this happens, if you simply press Play again to resume the podcast (either the button on headphones, or via Control Centre), it will not resume the podcast, but instead it will start playing music.

        Related: sometimes, when you pause a podcast, and press Play to resume, it starts playing music instead of the podcast.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        It is intermittent, and I havenâ€™t been able to identify any exact circumstances that allow it to be repeated 100% of the time. Playing podcasts enough should allow this to be observed.

        Expected Results:
        When playing podcasts, they should not stop playing for no reason. When pausing a podcast, then pressing Play again, the same podcast should continue playing from where it was paused.

        Actual Results:
        Podcasts sometimes stop playing for no reason. Sometimes, podcasts are not resumed after pausing.
