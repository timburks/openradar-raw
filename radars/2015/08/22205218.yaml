    description: "Summary:\nSwift protocols support optional methods, but only on @objc protocols. @objc protocols can only be fulfilled by @objc classes, which limits their use in pure Swift code. It would be helpful to have optional methods in pure Swift protocols, especially when adding new features to protocols while trying to maintain backward compatibility. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\n\nExpected Results:\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\n\nActual Results:\nExplain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.\n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
