    description: "Summary:\r\nFor our app I implemented Web-To-Native Handoff. This works perfectly on iOS 8, but on  iOS 9 only Safari is suggested to accept the handoff.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Have correctly constructed and signed apple-app-site-association file on your server\r\n2) Implement the app delegate method for handling handoff\r\n3) Install the app on an iOS 8 and an iOS 9 device\r\n4) On a Mac open a web page belonging to your domain\r\n5) Wake the iOS 8 and the iOS 9 device by pushing the power button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- in the bottom left corner you should see your native app's icon\r\n- if you pull this icon upwards the handoff should occur and your app show the corresponding page, regardless off iOS version\r\n- if the app is not installed then - of course - Safari shows and you can browse the same page in Mobile Safari\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- on iOS 8 the expected behavior occurs\r\n- on iOS 9 only Safari shows for accepting handoff, even if you have the native app installed\r\n\r\non iOS 9 the following lines appear in the console log:\r\n\r\nAug  3 16:35:13 Olivers-iPhone-6 SpringBoard[4828] <Notice>: -[UABestAppSuggestionManager notifyBestAppChanged:type:options:bundleIdentifier:activityType:dynamicIdentifier:when:confidence:deviceName:deviceIdentifier:deviceType:] D07B3CCE-B179-4619-8336-FB5299457BB1 UserActivity com.apple.mobilesafari/NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb opts={\r\n    } when=2015-08-03 14:35:13 +0000 confidence=1 from=Oliver's iPad Air/3BF1804F-4200-4893-A739-A1BB043F6DBC (UABestAppSuggestionManager.m #319)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nJudging from the UABestAppSuggestionManager notice, the code to determine the suitable app for continuing the activity has been changed. iOS 9 determines the \"best app suggestion\" to always be Mobile Safari. And this is incorrect.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
