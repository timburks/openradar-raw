    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to build & run on my Watch device, Xcode get stuck on \"Installing to Josh's Apple Watch | Copying libswiftCore.dylib\" in Xcode's top bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select Watch app target and Josh's iPhone 6 + Josh's Apple Watch to run (actual devices, not simulator)\r\n2. Click the Run button\r\n3. Observe a few messages in Xcode's top bar until it says \"Installing to My Apple Watch | Copying libswiftCore.dylib\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should install and run the app on my Apple Watch device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode get stuck for several minutes with the message \"Installing to Josh's Apple Watch | Copying libswiftCore.dylib\" in the top bar, with the blue progress bar about 1/4 of the way to the end. After several minutes, it progresses to about halfway.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 5 (7A176x)\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've tried cleaning the project and deleting derived data, and neither seems to have any effect. When I've gotten tired of waiting and hit the Stop button, it doesn't stop - the message still appears in the top bar of Xcode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs with the following devices:\r\n- iPhone 6 (iOS 9 beta 5)\r\n- Apple Watch (watchOS 2 beta 5)\r\n\r\nIt does not occur when running in the simulator."
