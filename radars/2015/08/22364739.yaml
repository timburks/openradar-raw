    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder iOS 9, If an application creates a second UIWindow, makes it key and visible, and then later closes the second window by nulling its last reference to it, the application’s first window does not become key; and [application keyWindow] returns nil.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from iOS 8 and earlier, where the application’s first window would become key after the second window was closed.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: If the second window is hidden immediately prior to being closed, the application’s first window does become key as expected.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been observed (via side effects) on iOS 9 betas 2, 3, and 5, but we did not pin down this cause until beta 5.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In an iOS application, after launching, observe that [[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] is the application's first window.\r\n2. Alloc and init a second window. Keep a strong reference to this second window.\r\n3. Make the second window key and visible.\r\n4. Observe that [[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] returns the second window.\r\n5. Release the strong reference to the second window.\r\n6. Observe that the window disappears from the screen as it is closed.\r\n7. Observe [[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] now.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe key window should now be the first window again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe key window is nil.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 5."
