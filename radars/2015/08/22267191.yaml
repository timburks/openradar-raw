        Summary:
        Randomly during the day, when using Safari, nsurlstoraged and Safari Networking will start contending for 100% usage of my CPU, which makes my computer so slow that even the mouse cursor becomes stuttery or even unresponsive. Quitting Safari, force-quitting the two offending daemons, or rebooting the computer will temporarily stop the issue from happening (CPU goes down to ~10% and I can use mouse and computer again), confirming that this is a Safari/network stack issue.

        I have 3 sticky tabs and ~100 normal tabs across a few spaces and tons minimized.

        Will amend with samples of daemons if I manage to get that much control over my computer next time it happens.
