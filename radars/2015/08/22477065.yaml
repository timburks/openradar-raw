    description: "Summary:\r\nOur company provides its own EULA, and has translated it into each of the 11 languages we support. However, only one EULA can be pasted into the custom EULA field, and it's not associated with any of the languages we support. We would still apply it worldwide, but it would be good if each language could see its own version of the EULA instead of having to dump all of them into one field and force the user to scroll to find the one they can read.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a custom EULA.\r\n2. Change the locale for the app.\r\n---> Description and What's new changes for each language, but EULA field doesn't change.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEULA should be different for each supported language, with a default to the primary if not specified in other languages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to paste all languages into the EULA field.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny web browser (Safari or Chrome)"
