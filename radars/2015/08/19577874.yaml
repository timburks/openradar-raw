    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter I moved a file in Finder (list view) one folder got a white text color instead of the usual dark grey. I can't really reproduce the bug though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe bug isn't really reproducible. That's what i've done when I encountered it:\r\n1. Moved a file into the \"Stuff\" folder (see attached screenshot)\r\n2. Another folder suddenly got white text. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFile gets moved and everything else stays the same. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFile gets moved but a folder has now white text color (instead of dark grey). Switching back and forth between folder fixes the problem."
