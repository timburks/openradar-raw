    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8, if a notification (UILocalNotification or UIRemoteNotification) is received where one of the notification actions does not have a title set, swiping left on the notification from the lock screen or notification center to reveal the actions will crash the phone instead.\r\n\r\nA sample project showing the problem for local notifications is available at: https://github.com/UberJason/NotificationCrash\r\n\r\nIn this project, two actionable notifications have been set up, but one action does not have a title set. This causes the crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download my sample project\r\n2. Run app\r\n3. Tap button to fire UILocalNotification\r\n4. Lock phone\r\n5. When UILocalNotification appears in 1 minute, swipe left to reveal actions (which crashes the phone instead of revealing actions)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe action lacking the title should either be blank, or not be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe phone crashes to the black Apple logo screen and reboots.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVerified on iPhone 5S and iPhone 6"
