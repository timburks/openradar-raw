        Summary:
        When enabling Airplane Mode, in Settings.app the Mobile Data section is disabled entirely. This prevents a couple of useful actions:

        * I can not turn on/off data roaming. This is problematic, because when one is allowed to turn Airplane Mode off on a plane, and this setting has the wrong value, at the time I can turn data roaming off, it may already have used some potentially expensive data.
        * I can not turn on/off cellular data access for certain apps. When traveling abroad, I want to prevent some apps from using cellular data which at home are allowed to use cellular data. While on a plane, it would be the perfect time to go through the list of installed apps and enable/disable cellular data accordingly.
        * I want to see (and screenshot) the mobile data statistics to compare it to my carriers cell phone bill. This would be most accurate while in Airplane mode

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Turn on Airplane Mode, try to disable Data Roaming

        Expected Results:
        Possible to turn off data roaming

        Actual Results:
        Not possible

        Regression:
