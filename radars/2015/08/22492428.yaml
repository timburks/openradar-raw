        Summary:
        When re-installing views that were uninstalled by a size class rule, UIStackView does not respect the installed positions

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a vertical stack view centered with several items.
        2. Set the top item and bottom item (for instance) be uninstalled on compact height (iPhone landscape)
        3. Rotate from Portrait to Landscape
        4. Rotate from Landscape to Portrait

        Expected Results:
        Initial portrait view and last portrait view are identical

        Actual Results:
        Views that are reinstalled are stacked overlapping in the upper-left corner of the stack view (see screenshot).
