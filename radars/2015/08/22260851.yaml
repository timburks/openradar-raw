    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to archive an iOS 8, iOS 9 app with a WatchOS 2 extension, code signing fails with the error If bitcode is disabled for the iOS app and enabled for the WatchOS 2 app.\r\n\r\nerror: Embedded binary is not signed with the same certificate as the parent app. Verify the embedded binary target's code sign settings match the parent app's.  \r\n  Embedded Binary Signing Certificate: Not Code Signed  \r\n  Parent App Signing Certificate: iPhone Distribution: [My signing certificate]  \r\n\r\nThis is a serious issue that halts development for us as 3rd-Party libraries have not upgraded to supporting bitcode and may not for some time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a WatchKit App to existing iOS app.\r\n2. Disable bitcode for iOS app\r\n3. Choose Product > Archive\r\n4. Build fails with error:\r\n\r\nerror: Embedded binary is not signed with the same certificate as the parent app. Verify the embedded binary target's code sign settings match the parent app's.  \r\n  Embedded Binary Signing Certificate: Not Code Signed  \r\n  Parent App Signing Certificate: iPhone Distribution: [My signing certificate]  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuilding an iOS 8, iOS 9 app that does not use bitcode with a WatchOS 2 app that does use bitcode, should allow me to archive and distribute my iOS and watchOS2 app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild fails with a code signing error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 Beta (15A244d), Xcode 7 beta 5 (7A176x), iOS 9 beta 5, watchOS 2 beta 5, iPhone 6 Plus\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a well reported issue on the developer forums: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/10392?q=Code%20Si\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" (Late 2013) OS X 10.11 Beta (15A244d), Xcode 7 beta 5, iOS 9 beta 5, watchOS 2 beta 5, iPhone 6 Plus"
