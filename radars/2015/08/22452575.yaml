    description: "iTunes Connect account activation asks a small number of questions, including month and day of month of a new user's date of birth. There is no option to enter a year of birth, yet as of recently this form now fails to validate on submission, giving the reason \"Invalid Year\". \r\n\r\nAn essentially identical bug has also been reported on Stack Overflow in the iTunes Connect system to create a sandbox user:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/32243705/ios-itunesconnect-sandbox-test-account-invalid-year?noredirect=1#comment52368764_32243705\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create iTunes Connect user account.\r\n2. Click on the email link to activate the account.\r\n3. Complete all fields presented.\r\n4. Submit the form.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nForm validates without a year for dob, since one is not provided.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nForm rejects submission saying \"Invalid year\". New iTunes Connect user accounts are unable to be activated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.5, reproduced on both Safari 8.0.8 and Chrome 44.0.2403.89."
