        Summary:
        My app supports the iOS 8 document picker (UIDocumentMenuViewController) in open mode (UIDocumentPickerModeOpen). If the user opens a file using the document picker, the app saves a security-scoped bookmark in order to show it in a list of recently opened files.

        If the user then deletes the app that provided the file, the security-scoped bookmark cannot be resolved anymore. Instead, the method +[NSURL URLByResolvingBookmarkData:options:relativeToURL:bookmarkDataIsStale:error:]  never returns.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use the "Openâ€¦" command in the app Textastic for iPad to open the README.md file from the example repository in the app "Working Copy"
        2. Close the file in Textastic or open another local file
        3. Delete the file provider app "Working Copy" from the device
        4. Open the Recent Files list in Textastic

        Expected Results:
        The list of recent files in Textastic should open.

        Actual Results:
        Textastic hangs in a call to +[NSURL URLByResolvingBookmarkData:options:relativeToURL:bookmarkDataIsStale:error:]

        Regression:
        If you reinstall the file provider app (Working Copy), it does not hang anymore.
        A reboot of the device does not fix the problem.

        Notes:
        I have attached a screenshot of the call stack. The app hangs in dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow
