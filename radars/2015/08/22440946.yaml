        Summary:
        In the latest Swift beta, when calling `swap()` with the same value as both parameters, Swift throws a run-time error. This is a regression from previous versions of Swift, where such a call executed safely.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Create a new playground (attached), and add the following code:

        var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        swap(&a[0], &a[1])
        swap(&a[0], &a[0])
        print(a)

        Expected Results:
        The console should show [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]

        Actual Results:
        The playground shows a runtime error on the third line and the console reads “fatal error: swapping a location with itself is not supported”

        Regression:
        This has worked in all previous versions of Swift.
