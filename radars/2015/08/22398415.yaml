    description: "Summary:\r\n-[UIPresentationController adaptivePresentationStyle] is not called, and not deprecated.\r\n\r\nMy investigation suggests -[UIPresentationController adaptivePresentationStyle] is not called  if the app is linked on or after iOS 8.3. It is replaced by -[UIPresentationController adaptivePresentationStyleForTraitCollection:].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project with Xcode 7, which attempts to adapt to full screen for horizontally compact size classes, and logs when adaptivePresentationStyle is called.\r\n2. Run it\r\n3. Look for adaptivity, and look in the console\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor either this method to be called, or for it to be marked as deprecated, or at least documented as not being called. (My preference is deprecation.)\r\n\r\nThe presented view should be full screen on iPhone 6 Plus in portrait and a small box in the corner in landscape.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis method is not called (nothing logged in the console), and nothing in the documentation suggests this method would not be called.\r\n\r\nThe view is in the example never adaptive, always appearing in the top left corner of the container.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated bug: 22394065.
