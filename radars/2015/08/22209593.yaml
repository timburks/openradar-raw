    description: "Summary:\r\nOn both iOS and OS X, there is no API to extract the Subject Public Key Info bits from an SSL certificate. This is useful when implementing SSL pinning, which requires pinning the SPKI as a best practice (as opposed to pinning the certificate or the public key - https://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/05/04/pinning.html).\r\n\r\nOn OS X, the SecCertificateCopyValues() function seemed like a good candidate in combination with the kSecOIDX509V1SubjectPublicKeyAlgorithm and kSecOIDX509V1SubjectPublicKeyAlgorithmParameters OIDs. \r\n\r\nHowever the function only returns a parsed output (such as the OID corresponding to the key algorithm) instead of the actual bytes of the SPKI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to extract the Subject Public Key Info bytes from an SSL certificate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be nice to be able to retrieve the SPKI bytes from an SSL certificate, in order to implement SSL pinning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no function in the Security framework to extract the SPKI data from a certificate.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8"
