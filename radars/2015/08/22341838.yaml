        Summary:
        It would be useful to have Safari open all URLs from specific apps in Private Browsing Mode.

        This would be especially useful for example for Twitter clients: You open random links to 3rd party websites, often even behind an URL shortener. You donâ€™t even know what site this will go to. So for privacy concerned users, opening all URLs from an app in Private Browsing mode would makes a lot of sense.

        Notes:
        I appreciate the latest steps you folks are taking regarding privacy, especially on the web. Thank you!
