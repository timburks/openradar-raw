    description: "Summary:\r\n-[CLGeocoder geocodeAddressString:inRegion:] takes a CLRegion, but returns results that are not in the given region. I consider this a bug. If I give a specific region, the results should be in that region. If no results in the region are found, the placemarks array should be nil/empty or the error should be populated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- call -[CLGeocoder geocodeAddressString:inRegion:] with the address string “Main” and a CLCircularRegion with a radius of 20km around Berlin, Germany\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the returned results are within the given region\r\n- if there are no results in the region, the placemarks array should not contain results that are not in the given region\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- the single returned placemark is “Main, PA, USA” which is not within the given region around Berlin, Germany\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached sample project and run the unit test. it currently fails.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0x062I1D0Z05"
