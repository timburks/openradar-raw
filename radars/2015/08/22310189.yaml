    description: "Summary:\nThere is no way to report a iMessage sender as “junk” or as spam in Yosemite 10.10.5. This feature has existed in iOS since 8.3.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nReceive an iMessage from an sender that is not in your contact list.\n\nExpected Results:\nYou should see a “This sender is not in your contact list. [Report Junk]” below the message(s). Clicking Report Junk should remove the conversation from your list and mark report it to Apple as spam.\n\nActual Results:\nNo button to Report Junk.\n\nNotes:\nThis happened after I received the message on my iPhone (iOS 8.4.1) and reported it as junk. It was successfully removed from my iPhone (but strangely, that conversation did not get deleted on my iPad nor my Mac (radar incoming \U0001F60E))"
