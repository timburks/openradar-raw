    description: "When searching an Xsan volume using Spotlight, the client will unexpectedly receive an error, which seems to terminate the search. At that time, the client logs MDSChannel errors in Console, and either a limited set of results or no results will be returned to the client. This occurs when searching the SAN volume using the Spotlight menu, Finder windows, and `mdfind`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Setup Xsan v.4 volume using Yosemite MDCs and clients.\r\n2.) Mount SAN volume with > 32TB of data that was previously searchable using Spotlight in OS X v.10.7 (Xsan v.2.3.)\r\n3.) Attempt to search largely populated Xsan volume using Spotlight menu, Finder search field, mdfind\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll Spotlight search results should be returned to the client.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClient intermittently receives full, partial, or no results from search. Client shows the following errors in /var/log/system.log:\r\n\r\n7/28/15 4:50:36.988 PM mds[56]: XSANFS_FSCTL_SpotlightRPC fsctl failed (errno = 7)\r\n7/28/15 4:50:36.988 PM mds[56]: ERROR: _MDSChannelXsanRequest: _XsanMDSChannelRequest failed: 7\r\n7/28/15 4:50:36.988 PM mds[56]: (Message.Error:142) MDSChannel RPC failure (fetchQueryResultsForContext:)\r\n7/28/15 4:50:36.988 PM mds[56]: (Store.Error:273) <MDSDistantStore 0x7fae88f876f0 shutdown:NO got shutdown notification:NO>{channel:0x7fae9817caf0 localPath:'/Volumes/CreativeSAN'} MDSChannel failed -- initiating recovery\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite v.10.10.4/14E46\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttempted to rebuild Spotlight index on primary MDC as outlined in older Apple support articles (allowing full Spotlight index rebuild while clients do not have volume mounted.) Attempted to use mdfind, Spotlight menu, and Finder search box with similar results. Performing Spotlight searches on the primary MDC provides all search results without errors. Attempted to perform search over AFP re-share of Xsan volume - same issues occur. Checked another disparate Xsan installation (running on Yosemite v.10.10.3) and observed identical issues. Attempted to use 10.10.5 developer preview on SAN client - issues persist. Attempted to use 10.11 developer preview on SAN client - issues persist.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXsan volume hosted by two Xserve MDCs with Yosemite (v.10.10.4). SAN storage is a mix of Apple, Active Storage, and NEC components. Clients are all connected via QLogic 5802v FC switch. SAN configuration was upgraded from working Xsan v.2.3 (Lion) system."
