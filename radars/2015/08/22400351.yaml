    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode is supposed to display crash reports from TestFlight and App Store builds of apps via the Crashes tab in the Organizer utility within Xcode. Despite receiving reports from colleagues and my own anecdotal evidence, no crash reports are ever downloaded from iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write an app that crashes\r\n2. Upload to TestFlight\r\n3. Install and run the app. It will crash. \r\n4. Check the Crashes tab in Xcode for reports.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe crash report from the crashing app is viewable within Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no crash reports in Xcode. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can manually sync a device to your Mac to retrieve the crash reports, but this is less than optimal with remote testers. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
