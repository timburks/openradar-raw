        Summary:
        Opening an Objective-C source file that contains an @import statement sometimes fails with an error (“Could not build module ‘X’). This error does not show up when you try to build the currently selected target.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Search for a source file that contains @import in your codebase.
        2. Open a file in the search results.

        Expected Results:
        The file opens without any error.

        Actual Results:
        The file opens and there is an error at the line of the @import statement.

        Notes:
        This seems to happen only with 3rd-party modules. I have yet to seen it with Apple-provided modules.
        Also, this error is more frequent unit test source files.
