    description: "Summary:\r\nForce Touching and tapping \"Customise\" simultaneously on a watch face causes all sorts of UI glitches across the system that can only be resolved by restarting the watch. See video: https://youtu.be/j-cDr3_mZYM.\r\n\r\nExample Issues:\r\n- Non-functioning scrollbar appears everywhere, including places where there should never be a scrollbar such as the home screen and watch face.\r\n- Watch face customisation boxes appear on the home screen.\r\n- It's possible to swipe through customisation options for a particular watch face when in the watch face selection menu.\r\n- Tapping the \"Customise\" button never works again until a system restart.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a watch face that supports customisation, lightly press on the screen until the \"Customise\" button appears.\r\n2. With another finger, tap on the \"Customise\" button.\r\n3. Press the Digital Crown to go to the home screen.\r\n4. Use Apple Watch and see UI glitches across the system.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe customisation screen appearing is fine, but all those other glitches shouldn't happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI glitches mentioned above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 1.0.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUsing Apple Watch 38 mm on watchOS 1.0.1"
