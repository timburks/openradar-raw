        Summary:
        It would be nice if would be possible to group rules in the content blocker json. With this you could enable more specific whitelist rules. See the example I provide.

        Imagine a list where you have  at first some rule for blocking ads on specific pages. Then you have whitelist entries with ignore-previous rules so that the ads won’t be blocked on these pages. Then you have some rules for blocking privacy intruding stuff. After this you want to apply a whitelist for those rules as well. The problems is now that those whitelist pages also ignore the ad blocking rules.

        Here is a illustration:
        ==========
        Ad-Block Rules
        ==========
        Ad-Block Whitelist
        ==========
        Privacy-Block Rules
        ==========
        Privacy-Whitelist
        ==========

        Privacy-Whitelist also ignores Ad-Block Rules

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a list with the similar rule set as above and load it in Safari

        Expected Results:
        I would expect a syntax for the json that lets you create groups of rules.

        An example would be:
        {
        	group: 	„Ad-Block rules,
        	rules:
        			{
        				//rules here
        			}
        },
        {
        	group: 	„Privacy rules,
        	rules:
        			{
        				//rules here
        			}
        }

        ignore-previous rules would now only ignore all the previous rules only in its group. If you want to apply it global place it outside the rules.

        I think this would be possible to implement efficiently.

        Actual Results:
        There is no possibility to group rules.
