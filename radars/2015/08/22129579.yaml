    description: "Summary:\r\nSiri no longer supports a phrase structure that it used to have for reminders. The workaround is a much more clumsy phrase.\r\n\r\nInstead of \"Put X on my Y list\", I have to use \"Remind me to X on my Y list\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith a reminder list called \"Shopping\", try using the following phrase structures and observe the responses.\r\n\r\n1. \"Put foo on my Shopping list\" -> \"I can't update reminders. Sorry about that.\"\r\n2. \"Remind me to foo on my shopping list\" -> \"I've added it.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth phrases should add a reminder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly phrase 2 adds a reminder"
