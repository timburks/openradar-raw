    description: "Summary:\r\nThis has happened twice now. The first time, I was going to install the latest OS X point upgrade along with updates to iTunes and Server. After quitting out all of my apps, the menu bar disappeared (but the Dock didnâ€™t), and my system hung until I restarted it with an SSH command (shutdown -r now). The second time, I did a sysdiagnose while it was in this state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Begin a restart of OS X from the Apple menu or install an OS X update from with the Mac App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOS X restarts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOS X hangs with all apps quit and the Menu Bar gone\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI never noticed this before 10.10.4, upgrading to 10.10.5"
