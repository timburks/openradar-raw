    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter updating to iOS9 beta 3, the cellular data on my iPhone 5 does not work.  I have since updated to beta 4 and beta 5 without any improvement.  \r\nOther steps I have taken, which did not solve the problem:\r\nHard reset.\r\nPower off then back on.\r\nToggle Airplane mode off then on.\r\nTurn off BlueTooth.\r\nTurn cellular data off, power off, power on, enable cellular data.\r\nEnable LTE and data roaming.\r\nWiped the phone and installed iOS9 beta 5 as a new device.\r\nSpent about an hour on the phone with Straight Talk support attempting to fix this issue without luck.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn off Wifi.\r\n2. Ensure Cellular Data is enabled.\r\n3. Attempt to connect with any app that uses internet, such as Safari.\r\n4. The error: \"Could not activate cellular data network. Turn on cellular data or use Wi-Fi to access data.\" appears in a popup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect no error message, and the page to load.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe error: \"Could not activate cellular data network. Turn on cellular data or use Wi-Fi to access data.\" appears in a popup.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 [13A4325c]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niOS 9 beta has completely disabled the cellular data on my phone even though it shows as being enabled.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, 16GB, Straight Talk CDMA (model MD105LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
