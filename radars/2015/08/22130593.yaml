        Summary:
        MPMoviePlayerController had a simple repeatMode-property that can be set to MPMovieRepeatModeOne to replay a video endlessly. But MPMoviePlayerController is deprecated in iOS 9 and we have to switch over to AVPlayerViewController, which doesnâ€™t support repeating videos by itself. The workarounds described in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5361145/looping-a-video-with-avfoundation-avplayer have to use the notification-center and suffer from a lack before the replay starts again.
        So please add and implement a AVPlayerActionAtItemEndReplay-case to the AVPlayer.
