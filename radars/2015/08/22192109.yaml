        I’m requesting this as a user, not as a developer: I beg of you, please — please — allow some way for third-party keyboards to access the dictation feature found on the standard keyboard.

        Without this feature, third-party keyboards will forever be crippled. Dictation is important enough to me that third-party keyboards are essentially unusable.
