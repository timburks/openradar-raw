    description: "Summary:\r\nFor an NSUserActivity to be indexed, it needs to have a matching Core Spotlight entry already in the index. However, it seems that user activities are not indexed until both userInfo and requiredUserInfoKeys are set, even with arbitrary values. Without these set, a duplicated item will appear in the search results, with no userInfo provided in application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler, making it impossible for application to consume the result. (thus the data loss)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n - Attempt to create a user activity *after* successful indexing item matching the user activity.\r\n - Make the user activity's relatedUniqueIdenitifier point to a valid UID. (do not set either userInfo or requiredUserInfoKeys)\r\n - Make the activity current and leave the application.\r\n - Attempt to search for the activity.\r\n\r\n(attached AppDelegate.m, lines 74-75 show the example of such situation, prune your index and comment line 75 to observe the actual behavior.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Spotlight results shows one result\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Spotlight results show two results.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2, iOS Simulator"
