    description: "The document of constant c uses “first attribute” and “second attribute” to refer to the anchors:\r\nThe constant offset for this relationship.\r\nFor NSLayoutXAxisAnchor objects, this is the number of points the second attribute is after the first attribute. When using leading or trailing attributes, this will move the second attribute in the current language’s reading direction. For English, this moves the second attribute to the right. For left and right attributes, it always moves the second attribute to the right.\r\nFor NSLayoutYAxisAnchor objects, this is the number of points the second attribute is below the first attribute.\r\nFor NSLayoutDimension objects, this is the number of points that the second attribute is larger than the first attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not clear which is which. In fact, in the point view of a method, “first” usually means “self” and “second” means the other. In this paring, the document is totally wrong because the constant is added to the other anchor but should be added to the “self” anchor."
