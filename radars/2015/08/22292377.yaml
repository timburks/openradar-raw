        Summary:
        An enterprise-signed app, on a device that’s been upgraded to iOS 9 from iOS 8, crashes on launch until the profile is manually trusted, five levels deep in Settings.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install an enterprise-signed app on iOS 8.4.1.
        2. Run the app on 8.4.1
        3. Update the device to iOS 9 (currently beta 5, 13A4325c)
        4. Try to run the app on iOS 9.

        Expected Results:
        The app should run. Worst-case, it should present iOS 9’s new and unfriendly “Untrusted Enterprise Developer” dialog, which expects the user to dig into Settings -> General -> Profile -> [Enterprise dev account], to tap a Trust button.

        Actual Results:
        The app crashes. The console log is the only way we were able to figure out what was going on. Here’s what it reports, with the important stuff on the second line:

        Regression:
        I was able to reproduce this on an iPhone 5, upgraded from iOS 8.2 to 9b5, after a report from a user who upgraded an iPhone 6 from iOS 8.4 to 9b5.
