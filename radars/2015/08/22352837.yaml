        Summary:
        If you have set up a Cocoa application using the NSMainStoryboardFile key in your Info.plist, so that NSApplication will automatically load and display an initial window from a storyboard file, there is no way to later access the NSStoryboard instance or the NSWindowController instance that it created

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new project using the standard OS X “Cocoa Application” template, and check the “Use Storyboards” checkbox
        2. In the applicationDidFinishLaunching method of your app delegate, access the window controller that is instantiated by the storyboard and do something with it

        Expected Results:
        I would expect to be able to do at least one of the following:
        1. Access a ‘storyboard’ property on the NSApplication object that returns the NSStoryboard instance it created on startup
        2. Access an ‘initialViewController’ property on the NSApplication object that returns the initial view controller that was instantiated by the storyboard
        3. Create an outlet for your app delegate to connect to the window controller and connect the outlet in Interface Builder (cross-controller connections are not allowed, it seems)

        Actual Results:
        None of these things exist.

        Notes:
        The only workaround I could find for this is to use the NSMainNibFile key in the Info.plist instead to load the main menu, then load a separate storyboard file manually from my app delegate using NSStoryboard.
