    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I tap a link, I see touchstart > touchend fired. When I tap a link using VoiceOver, only touchstart is fired. Note that this happens only on the first VoiceOver tap; subsequent taps don't fire either event.\r\n\r\nI can't find any docs on the intended VoiceOver/touch event interaction, so I don't know if the bug is 1) that a touchend event isn't fired, or 2) that touchstart is fired when it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://people.mozilla.org/~bnicholson/test/touchend.html\r\n2. Tap without VoiceOver; see touchstart > touchend > mousedown > mouseup\r\n3. Tap with VoiceOver; see touchstart > mousedown > mouseup\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect either:\r\n\r\n1. touchend to be fired after the touchstart event. Also, touchstart and touchend to be fired after all taps, not just the first one.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n2. Neither touchstart nor touchend are fired at all.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ntouchstart is fired, but touchend is not. And it's fired only after the first tap."
