    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an OS X project, if I declare an IBOutlet collection in Swift, Interface Builder does not show the collection in the right click interface of the object.  Using the same declaration style in an iOS project, the outlet shows up in Interface Builder and behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nThese collection outlets are declared in a similar way on both platforms:\r\n    @IBOutlet var views3: [UIView]?\r\n    @IBOutlet var views3: [NSView]?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an OS X project in Xcode 7 beta 5.\r\n2. Declare an IBOutlet collection on a custom view like so:\r\n    @IBOutlet var views3: [NSView]?\r\n3. Instantiate an instance of the custom view.\r\n4. Right click on the custom view object.\r\n5. Observe that the collection outlet is missing.\r\n\r\nA sample project that shows how this is missing for OS X but works as expected for iOS is available from github at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jaylyerly/OutletCollectionTestOSX\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInterface Builder should correct recognize IBCollection Outlets declared in Swift on OS X just like it does for iOS projects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIBCollection outlets declared in Swift in an OS X project is ignored by Interface Builder.  iOS based projects work correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 5 (7A176x) \r\nOS X 10.10.4 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs in OS X based projects in Xcode 7 beta 5."
