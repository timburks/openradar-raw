    description: "Similar to rdar://12551140, Smart Banners do not appear to recognize installed version of pre-release apps installed via TestFlight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Uninstall any copies of the app to be tested\r\n2) Install and run your smart-banner-supporting app from TestFlight\r\n3) Go to your website with smart banner metadata\r\n4) Note the VIEW button, which takes you to the App Store, rather than OPEN\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\n\r\nSmart Banner shows an OPEN button, and consistently opens the TestFlight-installed version of an existing product, recognizing that an app installed via TestFlight matching the App ID associated with the referring affiliate URL is available to receive the request, and opens the app appropriately (passing any optional data to the app presented by the request).\r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\n\r\nThe displayed Smart Banner on the referring web site displays a VIEW button instead of an OPEN button, and tapping VIEW takes the user to the App Store instead of opening the TestFlight-installed app.\r\n\r\nAs with the ticket referred to above, this makes testing of in-development or beta features related to Smart Banners and optional data unusable without first releasing to the App Store."
