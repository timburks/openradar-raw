        Summary:
        If you have a lot of layout constraints, IB helpfully stacks them so you can see each of them (like the 4 width constraints at the bottom in the attached screen shot).

        However, since the constraints laid out that way are taller than the view containing them, the 4th constraint is placed outside the view.

        This makes it unclickable. No matter where I click on this line, left, middle, right, or up to 2 pixels above or below the line or exactly on the line, all that happens is what would happen if I clicked in the empty canvas around the view.

        It is thus impossible to select this constraint.

        Well, I can go dig through the hierarchy editor and try every constraint in or above the selected view, and just try each one and see if it's the right one, but why can't I just click it on the canvas if it is right there?
