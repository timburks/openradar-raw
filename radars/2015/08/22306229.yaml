        Summary:
        The example project has got an Apple WatchOS2 app with an additional Framework compiled and linked to the app.
        The app is working normally in the watch simulator.

        After installing it and running it on a Apple Watch device the app doesn't start and the debugger shows the following error:

        dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/FWaWTest.framework/FWaWTest
          Referenced from: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/856895F8-0697-4D1D-914B-799CED60ECAB/com.babbel.AW2.watchkitapp.app/PlugIns/AW2App Extension.appex/AW2App Extension
          Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create new project in Xcode for iOS.
        2. Create new target for watchOS 2.
        3. Create a new framework target for watchOS 2.
        4. Embedded the framework to the Watch Extension.

        Expected Results:
        The framework should be loaded during app launch.

        Actual Results:
        The framework is not loaded correctly. App crashes.

        Version:
        watchOS 2.0 (13S5305d)
        Xcode 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t)
