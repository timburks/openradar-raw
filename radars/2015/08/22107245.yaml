    description: "Summary:\r\nTable views instantiated from XIB files and Storyboards compiled using Interface Builder in Xcode 7 beta 4 (7A165t) have white (default) background at runtime, regardless of background color set for them in Interface Builder. This issue happens when running any iOS version on device/simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty app with a view controller that manages a view with a table view, using a XIB file or Storyboard to construct the interface.\r\n2. Set table view color to red in Interface Builder, without changing anything in code.\r\n3. Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTable view has a red background (apart from the area covered by cells).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTable view has a white (default) background color.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 4 (7A165t) running OS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression from previous Xcode versions. I have no information regarding whether it appeared in Xcode 7 beta 4 or in earlier seeds. A workaround for this issue is to set the background color manually in code, but that's kinda missing the point of Interface Builder.\r\nThe attached project demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device or simulator.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableBackgroundColorDemo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
