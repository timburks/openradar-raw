    description: "Using my iPhone 6+ with iOS 8.3 and later versions when I try to install an Apple-signed configuration profile, it shows as \"Not Verified\". Using my iPhone 5s with iOS 8.2 or iPod with iOS 7.1.1 when I try to install the same signed configuration profile, it shows as \"Verified\". I can reproduce this all of the time.\r\n\r\nI have seen at least one other report for the same issue here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7088347.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new configuration profile in iPhone Configuration Utility and export it unsigned.\r\n2. Sign the configuration profile with my iOS Distribution Certificate issued by Apple (embedding the respective trust chain that looks like this: Apple Inc. Root Certificate -> Worldwide Developer Relations Certificate -> My iOS Distribution Certificate.\r\n3. Try to install the configuration profile from a device with iOS 8.3 operating system.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConfiguration profile should show as \"Verified\" on installation screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConfiguration profile shows as \"Not Verified\" on installation screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can reproduce this on iOS 8.4 and iOS 9 Beta as well.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus 16GB, using WiFi"
