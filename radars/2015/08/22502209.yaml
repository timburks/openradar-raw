    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nScheme Pre-actions cannot cancel build\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Open an Xcode scheme\r\n2. Add a pre-action to the build action within the scheme which attempts to cancel the build (for example because some pre-condition has not been met) using exit 1 (or any non-zero error code)\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nXcode continues merrily along its way with the build.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nDoesn't work back to Xcode 4. Can't test farther back than that.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nIt *IS* possible to \"cancel\" the build using \"kill -HUP $PPID\" but that's not exactly a smooth user-experience."
