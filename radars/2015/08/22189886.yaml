    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTextEdit and any other application that uses the standard font panel can’t specify the new San Francisco system font. This means you can’t use an RTF file as source for attributed strings if you want to match the text to the user interface.\r\n\r\nAn example is Credits.rtf that is used in the standard about box.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse an RTF file as a source of text in a project. A test project is included that uses RTF for credits in the standard about box.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to specify the equivalent of -systemFontOfSize: with the standard font panel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no way to specify the system font.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIn earlier releases of OS X, the system font was exposed as “Helvetica Neue” or “Lucida Grande” and could be selected like any other font.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHacking at RTF source code to use a dotted name breaks the abstraction of the system font."
