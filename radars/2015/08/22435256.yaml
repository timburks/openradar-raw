    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://21387804\r\n\r\nThe new “universal links” system allows applications to specify “associated domains,” domains whose links the application can intercept. These domains look as follows; please note that a separate entry is required for each specific subdomain:\r\n\r\napplinks:workable.com\r\napplinks:www.workable.com\r\n\r\nWorkable uses a different subdomain for each company’s accounts, e.g. a sample account can be found at “http://bigelephants.workable.com/backend” (sign in is required)\r\n\r\nIn order to open blogs links in the native workable app (currently in the works), we would need to be able to specify a wildcarded associated domain as follows:\r\n\r\napplinks:*.workable.com\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry using an asterisk to specify a wildcarded associated domain (e.g. “*.workable.com”) for universal links.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLinks to any subdomain under the domain (e.g. “bigelephants.workable.com”) would be routed to the third-party application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLinks to subdomains open in Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:"
