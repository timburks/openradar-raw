        Summary:
        Apple Music is mostly great, but I tried to listen to one of my Kendrick Lamar albums and I find myself listening to censored music.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Own some albums by a rapper that uses “swear” words in their music.
        2. Sign up for Apple Music
        3. Go to listen to said foul-mouthed rapper.
        4. Hear a bunch of weird gaps in the audio where they removed the “swear” words.
        5. Be upset that your music is ruined.

        Expected Results:
        I expect to hear all the “swear” words that are part of the song the way the artist wrote it.

        Actual Results:
        My music is ruined even though I bought it outside of Apple Music.

        Regression:
        This was never an issue before Apple Music. iTunes Radio even gave the option to listen to the explicit version of songs and I enjoyed that.

        Notes:
        No workarounds except for unsubscribing from Apple Music. This isn’t the only complaint I’ve heard about the service.
