    description: "Summary:\nOften one only wants to test how an app behaves when connecting to its “own” server. In case of a game this might be the game server, in case of a messaging app the messaging server. \n\nI would like to be able to specify those host’s IPs or IP ranges in a Network Link Conditioner profile. This would make it easier to test with very bad connection settings, but don’t effect other network connection on the Mac: One would still be able to browse docs online, push git commits, see build results from Xcode bots or use messaging apps.\n\nRight now, if I test with 100% packet loss, everything else stops working as well."
