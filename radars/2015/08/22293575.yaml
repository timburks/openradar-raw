        Summary:
        When editing a contact and deleting a custom label, the custom is removed from all contacts that use it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create two contacts (Contact1, Contact2) that have phone numbers with a custom label (TestLabel)
        Start editing Contact1
        Tap on the phone number label to open the Label picker
        Choose a different label
        Delete the previous label
        Press Done to close the Label picker
        Press Done to finish editing
        Open Contact2

        Expected Results:
        The phone number for Contact2 should have the label TestLabel.

        Actual Results:
        The label is changed to phone which isnâ€™t even an option in the Label picker.

        Regression:
        Previous worked on iOS 8 but could crash if deleting the last custom label.
