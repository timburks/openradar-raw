    description: "Summary:\r\nUpdating watchOS on an Apple Watch is currently a time consuming and frustrating experience which falls below what user expect of Apple products.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate there are limitations on the connectivity available between the iPhone and Apple Watch, there seems to be some kind of fundamental reliability problem; the update process keeps inexplicably pausing, even though the listed conditions for updating are all true. The whole process takes far too long - often as long as 9 hours.\r\n\r\nIf this is what end-users will experience for the final watchOS 2 release, I think Apple Watch is going to get a hammering on social media and in the press.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start watchOS update\r\n2. Observe the process keeps pausing inexplicably\r\n3. Double check all update conditions are met\r\n4. Get frustrated\r\n5. Try killing and restarting the Apple Watch app on iOS\r\n6. Try rebooting the iPhone\r\n7. Try rebooting the Apple Watch\r\n8. Give up in frustration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect an Apple Watch to update in about the same time it takes for an iOS update to install.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVery slow, frustrating and unpredictable update experince.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2.x (all versions released to developers so far.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou guys can do better than this!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
