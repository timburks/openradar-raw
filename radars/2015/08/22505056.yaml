    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the iOS 9, when the keyboard changes to one of a different size (e.g., the predictive text bar shows/hides), the UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification and UIKeyboardDidChangeFrameNotification's are not fired.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create 2 text fields/views, and set correction = NO on one of them (see sample app).\r\n2. Observe UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification\r\n3. Select one text field, and then the other\r\n4. The height of the keyboard should change (the predictive text bar should show/hide)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification is fired whenever the keyboard frame changes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification is not fired when the keyboard frame changes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee example app. This is a bug in iOS 9, but works correctly in iOS 8.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that this is similar to, or maybe a dupe of, rdar://22437233\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 (including iPhone Simulator)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'KeyboardBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
