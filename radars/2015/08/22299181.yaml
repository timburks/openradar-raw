    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is often nice to print booleans as YES or NO.  There is a function called NSStringFromBOOL that does just this.  Unfortunately, it is not exported to client code, so clients have to (unsafely) declare the function extern in their own source files.  This method should be exported.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to use NSStringFromBOOL in your code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code compiles.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe code will not compile unless NSStringFromBOOL is declared extern.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLatest Xcode\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
