    description: "When tapping the Safari button in SFSafariViewController, Safari opens with the currently displayed web page.\r\nHowever, Safari does not display the \"Back to <originating app>\" link in the status bar. \r\n\r\nThis is surprising and inconsistent since other, similar app switches always display back links. Also, there's a high probability the user actually wants to go back to the originating app in this use case."
