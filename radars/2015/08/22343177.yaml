    description: "Xcode uses the .mobileprovision UUID as the file identifier from which to get the signing information. It should instead use the file path/name to get the signing information.\r\n\r\n1. Download a .mobileprovision file from the developer portal.\r\n2. Install it into ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles\r\n3. Set your Xcode target to use that profile by selecting it in the build settings.\r\n4. Update the .mobileprovision profile on the developer portal by adding a new entitlement.\r\n5. Download and install that new profile into ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles overwriting the first profile from step 1 & 2.\r\n6. Build the target in Xcode.\r\n\r\nI would expect the target to be built and signed with the new profile that was installed in step 5.\r\n\r\nXcode tries to sign the target with the .mobileprovision from step 1. This is because that profiles UUID is embedded in the Xcode project instead of the file path/name of the wanted profile."
