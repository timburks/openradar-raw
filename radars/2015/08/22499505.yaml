    description: "Summary:\r\nThe video file contains a logo which fades from black and the blends with the background. However using the Quicktime X 'export' functionality, the logo blends with white, resulting in an opaque white rectangle. This differs from what is played, and the alpha block should fade with black as it is the expected behaviour for alpha handling.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached video file with Quicktime X\r\n2. Play the file and notice how the logo fades with the background.\r\n3. Go to File -> Export and choose any format\r\n4. Wait for conversion to finish\r\n5. Check results, a white rectangle is shown instead of the logo, which differs from what was played."
