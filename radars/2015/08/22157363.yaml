Opening the photo will reveal that only the thumbnail is affected. A restart of Photos will not fix the issue. \r\n\r\n(See video attachment)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On your iPhone, use iCloud photo sync\r\n2. Open Photos on mac and notice recently synced photos\r\n3. Discover that some thumbnails are corrupted. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPhotos should not corrupt thumbnails.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhotos corrupts thumbnails, at random. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPhotos Version 1.1 (325.9.3)\r\nMac ElCapitan Beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'bug_report_corrupted_thumbnail.mov' was successfully uploaded."
