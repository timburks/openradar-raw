        Summary:

        UIViewControllerContextTransitioning's documentation for isInteractive
        reads:

        > Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the transition is
        > interactive.

        This implies that the specific context will always return true for this
        for an interactive transition. In our tests we've found that this method
        only returns true during the interactive transition. As the transition
        context is being completed, it returns false.

        The header for this method has a comment which reflects this. It reads:

        > This indicates whether the transition is currently interactive.

        With "currently" being the important word here. This should be part of
        the official documentation.

        Expected Results:

        The isInteractive documentation should contain the same information as
        the header.
