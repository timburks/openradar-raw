    description: "Summary:\r\nThe calendar app needs way more contrast - the detail text on these events fails accessibility requirements for contrast.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Calendar app to view a calendar appointment on a green-tinted event.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect that Apple would have contrast settings that pass accessibility requirements.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe subtitle text on events isn't legible (see screenshot)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n13S5325c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Napkin 08-26-15, 4.29.18 PM.png' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nFor OpenRadar folks: Here's the attachment: http://clrk.it/19x1G"
