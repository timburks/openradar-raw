        Summary:
        After doing an OTA upgrade from iOS 9b4 to 9b5 on my iPad Air 2, all non-Apple apps were missing. My custom desktop image was still there, though, so it wasn’t a complete fresh install.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        I’m not absolutely sure, but I did a number of things differently from normal. I will try to recall them as best I can. This was all done while on battery, starting at ~92% if I recall correctly.

        1. I had started the OTA process at the office, then forgot about it.
        2. When I got home (and on a different wifi network), I was reminded about the update and if I wanted to install now.
        3. I pressed “Later” which told me it would install between 2-4am. (I don’t recall ever seeing this before.)
        4. I noticed that the Twitter app was a generic icon and said “Installing”. I don’t recall triggering an update for it.
        5. In the App Store updates tab, it showed Twitter update as stalled. I tapped the progress button to stop the install, then tapped the Update button to restart the app update.
        6. I noticed that the Twitter app was no longer in the folder it had been in—not an updating progress icon.
        7. Restarted the device since that normally cleanly resets glitched app updates.
        8. On restart, I was prompted to install the OTA update. “What the heck, I’ve already been interrupted” I thought and agreed.
        9. After what appeared to be a successful update, only Apple apps were left on the device. They were all on the pages they’d been placed on, and in folders they’d been placed in so it wasn’t a total reset.

        I am currently in the process of restoring from iCloud backup. Obviously I don’t expect to be able to attempt to reproduce this.
