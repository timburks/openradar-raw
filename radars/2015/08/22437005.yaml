    description: "Summary:\nThe iOS Simulator needs a new item in some menu to open its own folder in the Finder. \nHaving access to that folder is needed in order to perform some actions while developing like removing filers, cleaning caches or updating DB manually to perform tests. \nOne can open the folder manually but being in a different place in different Xcode versions makes this painfully. \nThe simulator already has useful options like taking screenshots or even Opening the system Log. So adding an option to Open the simulator folder I think it makes sense.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOpen any menu in the iOS simulator and you will not find any way to open the menu.\n\nExpected Results:\nFind a item menu that allows me to open the simulator folder in Finder.\n\nActual Results:\nThis menu item does not exist."
