    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you want to use CoreText in watchOS (for instance, to render small-caps text, as I do in the attached sample project), you can’t use it directly, as you can’t import CoreText.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In a watchOS 2 project, import CoreText using:\r\nSwift: import CoreText\r\nObjective-C: @import CoreText;\r\n\r\n2. Build\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app builds and you can use constants defined in CoreText headers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe compiler throws an error that it can't find CoreText.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAccording to this URL, as of Beta 4, CoreText is in WatchKit:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/releasenotes/General/watchOS2SeedAPIDiffs/frameworks/CoreText.html\r\n\r\nSince there’s no <CoreText/CoreText.h> to be found, I tried this:\r\n\r\n#import <CoreText/SFNTLayoutTypes.h>\r\n\r\nsince that header was explicitly added in the diff, but it still wouldn’t work."
