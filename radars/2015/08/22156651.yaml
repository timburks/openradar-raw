    description: "Summary:\r\nUnable to bypass Hello, WiFi, TOS and Get Started Screens when using configurator. \r\n\r\nI can bypass every screen accept those.\r\nWhen using configurator or an MDM I should be able to get a device in a state where when the user unlocks it is ready to use.\r\n\r\nCurrently the follow screens can not be removed:\r\nHello\r\nWiFi (Even when a profile connects the device to a network)\r\nTOS (No point, useless tapping)\r\nGet Started (Just take me to the home screen)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing Apple Configurator 2 or an MDM set the device to bypass all setup screens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll screens should be bypassed including Hello, WiFi, TOS and Get Started Screens. The device should be ready to use and not require these extra taps\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently you can't bypass Hello, WiFi, TOS and Get Started Screens. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 13A4305g\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad"
