    description: "Summary:\r\nI cannot find a combination of model presentation or pushing to a UINavigationController that works for CNContactViewController and many common methods of presentation are not functional, leaving the user with an undismissable modal, or a view that allows edits but cannot be saved.\r\n\r\nThere are too many combinations to list them all here.  The attached projects demonstrates the following:\r\n\r\n- pushing to a UINavigationController that is the root controller\r\n- presenting the CNContactViewController directly with presentViewController\r\n- presenting a UINavigationController with CNContactViewController as it's root using presentViewController\r\n\r\nThese are demonstrated for both \"forNewContact\" and \"forUnknownContact\" modes for the CNContactViewController.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the resulting CNContactViewController is unusable, either because it cannot be dismissed, or cannot have changes saved, due to lack of appropriate buttons in the resulting navigation bars.\r\n\r\nThese bugs are present in iOS 9b5.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached project, tap buttons provided to demonstrate states.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe resulting presented CNContactViewControllers should, well, be useable.  If there are only specific contexts in which CNContactViewController should be presented and used, these state should be documented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVaries, but in all cases the user is stuck per descriptions above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BUG_CNContactViewController.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\nhttp://media.agiletortoise.com/bugs/BUG_CNContactViewController.zip"
