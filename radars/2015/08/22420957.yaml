    description: "The customizability of NSTextField is quite limited. One wants to be able to change border color, background color, corner rounding, and text and placeholder text colors without resorting to recreating a text field from scratch. \r\n\r\nSwitching NSTextField to use the borderless appearance affords more custom drawing but drastically changes the position of the text baseline, rendering it unsuitable as a general replacement."
