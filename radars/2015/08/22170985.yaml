        Summary:
        I have a short three-letter email alias (let’s say, xyz). If some random iCloud user sends a message to “xyz”, rather than “xyz@me.com”, iCloud’s mail servers append the me.com domain onto the end, resulting in an email to me from someone who never intended to email me.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the Mail app on an iPhone
        2. Enter “xyz” in the “To” field
        3. Choose an “@me.com” account in the “From” field
        4. Enter a subject
        5. Tap Send
        6. Tap “Send” in the Invalid Address dialog

        Expected Results:
        You get a dialog reading “Cannot Send Mail – A copy has been placed in your Outbox. The recipient “xyz” was rejected by the server.”, which is what happens when choosing a Google account (Google Apps) in step 3 and substituting “xyz” with a username I know is valid for that server

        Actual Results:
        I get an email in my inbox addressed to “xyz <xyz@me.com>”
    email: thedov@gmail.com
