        Summary:
        When using a Swift extension to conform to a protocol, the Xcode jump bar does not display the name of the protocol that is being conformed to. It only displays the name of the type that is being extended. A workaround for this is to use "// MARK: - PROTOCOL_NAME" for each extension to display the protocol name. Ideally, the jump bar would automatically display something like "ViewController: UITableViewDelegate" for extensions that conform to protocols.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use a Swift extension to conform to a protocol (ex. UITableViewDelegate).
        2. Select the jump bar in Xcode.
        3. Look for both the name of the type that is being extended and the protocol name in the jump bar.

        Expected Results:
        The jump bar should display the name of the type and protocol name that the type is conforming to.

        Actual Results:
        The jump bar is only displaying the name of the type.

        Notes:
        Workaround: use "// MARK: - PROTOCOL_NAME" to display the protocol name in the jump bar.
