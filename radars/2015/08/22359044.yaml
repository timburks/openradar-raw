    description: "A UIActionSheet that is presented using showInView:self.view.window is displayed under the keyboard if the keyboard is currently shown.\r\n\r\niOS 8.x (and iOS 9 for apps built against the iOS 8.x SDK) display the action sheet on top of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nNote: I haven't tested a UIAlertController with with a preferredStyle of UIAlertControllerStyleActionSheet. Since UIActionSheet is implemented using UIAlertController anyway, I assume the issue also occurs with UIAlertController."
