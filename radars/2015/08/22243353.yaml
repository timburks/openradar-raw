    description: "Summary:\r\nIncorrect behavior is observed on an iPad when a popover is presented, and the user transitions from regular to compact size class. Upon transition between these size classes, UIPresentationController’s delegate is given a chance via  presentationController(_: , viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle) to return a view controller wrapped in a UINavigtationController. When doing this, it is clear the child in the now modally presented view controller (which is now inside a UINavigationController) is given an incorrect size in viewWillTransitionToSize(_:withTransitionCoordinator:). This behavior is not present if not wrapping the view controller in a UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Universal App.\r\n2. Create a button that can present a view with a presentation style of .Popover\r\n3. Respond to the delegate of the popoverPresentationController’s method presentationController(_:viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle) with the presentationController’s presentedViewController wrapped in a UINavigationController\r\n4. Launch the app on an iPad in landscape.\r\n5. Tap the button to present a popover.\r\n6. Transition into 50/50 Split View\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe size reported to the presented view controller via viewWillTransitionToSize(_:withTransitionCoordinator) should be accurate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInaccurate sizes are given.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 13A4325c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a sample project that demonstrates this issue, and the issue of collection view cell sizing that allowed me to stumble onto it. It also contains a screenshot of running the broken and fixed schemes.\r\n\r\nIt contains two schemes. BrokenTransitionToSizeBroken and BrokenTransitionToSizeFixed. The only difference is that ...Broken defines a flag that responds to presentationController(_:viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle) with the view wrapped in a UINavigationController. The Fixed version simply does not wrap this controller and expected behavior is observed both visibly, and in the console where I'm logging out the expected size.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BrokenTransitionToSize.zip' was successfully uploaded."
