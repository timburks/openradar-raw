    description: "Summary:\n\npublic subscript (subRange: Range<Int>) -> ArraySlice<Element> is not working.\n\nThis is from Xcode 7 beta 6 release notes\n\n\"For consistency and better composition of generic code, ArraySlice indices are no longer always zero- based but map directly onto the indices of the collection they are slicing and maintain that mapping even after mutations.\r\rBefore:\r\rvar a = Array(0..<10)\rvar s = a[5..<10]\rs.indices\rs[0] = 111\rs\rs.removeFirst()\rs.indices\r\rTry to run this code, it doesn't work.\r\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\nMake a playground, run the code. \n\nExpected Results:\nIt should work\n\nActual Results:\nfatal error: ArraySlice index out of range\n\nNotes:\nPlaygrounds is attached"
