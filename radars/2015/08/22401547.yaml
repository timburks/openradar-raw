    description: "Summary:\r\nA and B are portrait-only VCs. C is all-orientation VC.\r\n\r\nCase 1: If C is presented with custom presentation(shouldRemovePresentersView = true) on A directly, C can rotate to landscape correctly. But after dismissing C, A is in landscape even though it only supports portrait.\r\n\r\nCase 2: If B is first presented with custom presentation(shouldRemovePresentersView = false) on A and C is then presented with custom presentation(shouldRemovePresentersView = true) on B, C can not rotate to landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Use button “Present C” to see Case 1.\r\n2. Use button “Present B” to see Case 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCase 1: after dismissing C in landscape, A should appear in portrait mode.\r\nCase 2: C should support landscape mode.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1h2O382H1p1J"
