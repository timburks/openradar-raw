        Summary:
        Many times on long car trips, I like to select a playlist from the For You section. CarPlay does not allow me to scroll this so I have to use my phone while driving which is unsafe.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Decide to find a For You Playlist
        2. Notice that CarPlay does not let you browse ForYou Playlists

        Expected Results:
        1. Decide to find a For You Playlist
        2. Click For You in CarPlay
        3. See a scrollable quick list of For You Stations

        Actual Results:
        1. Decide to find a For You Playlist
        2. Notice that CarPlay does not let you browse ForYou Playlists

        Regression:
        none

        Notes:
