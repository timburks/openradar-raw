        The inter-page navigation introduced in Xcode 7 Playgrounds is terrific. Unfortunately, pages that have spaces in their names cannot be linked to using the “navigation to a specific page” syntax. In a Playground with pages named “Contents” and “Page One”, only the first of these will be properly linked:

        //: - [Link to "Contents"](Contents)
        //: - [Link to "Page One"](Page One)


        Steps to Reproduce:

        (See attached Playground.)

        1) Create a new Playground and add a new Playground Page.
        2) Rename the pages “Contents” and “Page One”.
        3) Paste the code above into either page.
        4) Turn on the Render Documentation option in the File Inspector.

        Expected Results:
        Both items in the list should be linked, so it displays as:

            * Link to “Contents”
            * Link to “Page One”

        Actual Results:
        Only the first item is linked, with the second rendered as raw markup:

            * Link to “Contents”
            * [Link to “Page One”](Page One)
