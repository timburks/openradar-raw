    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen use NSURLSession to sending a HEAD request, with custom delegate to disable redirect, the session will not respect NSAppTransportSecurity. \r\n\r\ni.e. All request will timeout if they are not https, even we made an exception in NSAppTransportSecurity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Info.plist set NSAppTransportSecurity > NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = YES\r\n2. Made a custom NSURLSession with delegate to disable redirect\r\n3. Made a HEAD request.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe HEAD request should success.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe HEAD request failed with timeout.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf it is not a HEAD request but a GET request, the session will run properly. \r\nIf the URL is a HTTPS URL, the session will run properly.\r\n\r\nSample project to reproduce the issue: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4iezu0q36jp1ylj/HTTPHead.zip?dl=0 \r\n\r\nPlease check the HTTPHeadTests.swift (https://github.com/siuying/RadarSample/blob/master/HTTPHead/HTTPHeadTests/HTTPHeadTests.swift)"
