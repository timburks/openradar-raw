    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user is looking to play music, particularly if they are familiar with Apple Music or the \"Music\" app on iTunes, they might reasonably type \"music\" into Spotlight.\r\n\r\nObviously many people think that \"Music\" should be its own app on the Mac, but it's not.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, typing \"music\" into Spotlight should yield \"iTunes\" as a top result, because this is likely to be what a user is searching for.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Invoke Spotlight\r\n2. Type \"music\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should be a top result.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes flashes as a result but is immediately replaced by a variety of unhelpful matches including Contacts, Mail, and Folders matches.\r\n\r\nI know your policy is to request a mddiagnose for Spotlight bugs, but I find this policy egregious. If your screeners will do me the favor of testing on a typical mac to see if \"music\" yields \"iTunes\" as a result, I'll be satisified it's just a fluke of my system. If it doesn't yield iTunes, it's a bug and you should fix it :)\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A263e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
