    description: "Summary:\n\nWhen I open a mail message (a receipt for renewing my Developer Program in this case) with an attachment (see mail1.jpg) I see a couple of problems. \n\nFirstly there’s a visual glitch: it kind of appears on screen twice, though only one of them is selectable.\n\nSecondly: that glitch appear on other messages (mail2.jpg). In those other messages, the attachment is not selectable; it just gets in the way of viewing the messages.\n\nSimple image attachments don’t seem to trigger the problem. I have seen it with PDFs and RTFs.\n\nRestarting Mail clears the glitch until a message with an attachment is opened again.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nOpen mail message with attachment. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nOne copy of the attachment. The attachment is only visible on the message it arrived in.\n\nActual Results:\n\nVisual glitch on message. The attachment is visible in other messages until a restart if Mail.\n\nRegression:\n\nI’ve not run iOS 9 on my iPhone prior to b5. Certainly it’s not a problem in iOS 8.x.\n\nNotes:\n\nI only see this on my iPhone. My iPad — attached to the same mail accounts — does not exhibit the same problem."
