    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are two methods for creating instances of UIKeyCommand, one with a discoverabilityTitle parameter and one without. It seems reasonable for calling the latter with a nil discoverability title to be equivalent to calling the first. Indeed this runs fine, but there is a nullability conversion warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an iOS project in Xcode\r\n2. Add code similar to this:\r\n\r\n[UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:UIKeyInputLeftArrow modifierFlags:0 action:@selector(goToPreviousPage:) discoverabilityTitle:[object methodThatReturnsANullableString]]\r\n\r\nwhere methodThatReturnsANullableString is a method that returns `nullable NSString *`.\r\n\r\nOr just try passing nil as the discoverabilityTitle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warnings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWarning: Implicit conversion from nullable pointer 'NSString * _Nullable' to non-nullable pointer type 'NSString * _Nonnull'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI checked the iOS 9.0 Beta 5 API Diffs and there appear to be no changes since beta 4.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: cast the argument as (NSString *).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRan in iOS 9 Simulator, but the problem is with a compiler warning\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
