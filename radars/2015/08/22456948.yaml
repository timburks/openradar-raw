    description: "Summary:\r\nConsider enabling developers to choose a different font & color theme for each project. Open projects would use individual color themes rather than the application-wide default. \r\n\r\nThis would provide an extra visual cue as to the currently active project, especially useful when switching focus between versions of a project, or closely related codebases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nChange the theme under Xcode Preferences / Font & Colors\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach open project can be rendered using a different color theme. Color themes are saved as part of project preferences, falling back to the application default if unavailable/not specified.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nColor themes are currently application-wide and each open project uses the same theme from Xcode preferences. Changing the color theme affects all open projects. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
