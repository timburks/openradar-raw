    description: "Summary:\r\nSettings the properties of an UICollectionViewFlowLayout in viewDidLayoutSubviews() does nothing. Even after calling invalidateLayout() of layoutIfNeeded(), the old values are still being used when displaying the UICollectionView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample project \r\n2. Rotate the device\r\n3. Note how the minimum line spacing is not correct even though it's set correctly in viewDidLayoutSubview()\r\n4. Tap on a cell to manually trigger a layout invalidation\r\n5. The layout is now correct\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe minimum line spacing set in viewDidLayoutSubviews() should be respected after the rotation has completed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe minimum line spacing is completely ignored and is only respected if we call collectionViewFlowLayout.invalidateLayout() again at a later point (e.g. a button click).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 - ...\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI included a boolean flag useAutoLayout in viewDidLoad to indicate how the issue only pops up when using Auto Layout.\r\nThe example project uses the minimumLineSpacing to indicate the issue but other properties (e.g. itemSize) aren't working as well.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll Simulators and Devices.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
