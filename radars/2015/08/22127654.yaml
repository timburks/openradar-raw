    description: "Summary:\r\nThis issue occurs by simply adding a photo file with the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus camera to an <input type=form\">\r\n\r\nI've put together a simple sample code: http://output.jsbin.com/jawisu/8\r\n\r\nThis is 100% reproducible on and iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on iOS 8.4 when enough tabs are opened (brought into memory).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open many tabs with various websites (at least 8)\r\n2. Open the sample code website in Mobile Safari (http://output.jsbin.com/jawisu/8)\r\n3. Tap the \"Choose File\" button, and use the device's camera to attach a photo (the \"Take Photo\" option).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the file reference to be contained in the <input type=\"file\"> DOM node.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Safari tab reloads and a small pane appears at the top saying \"A problem occurred with this webpage so it was reloaded\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease contact me if there is a known workaround.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
