    description: "Summary:\nSourceKit says a file (which is added to the Xcode project as a symlink) isnt part of the input files, even though it totally is. Readlink might be helpful. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Create Xcode project where a group’s root is a symlink to a directory\n2) Add swift file to that directory and to group\n3) Open the generated swift interface for that file \n\nExpected Results:\nIt shows the generated interface.\n\nActual Results:\nBut it totally doesn’t.\n\n“Error (from SourceKit): REAL_FILE_PATH is not part of the input files”"
