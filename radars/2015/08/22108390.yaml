        Summary:
        In rdar://problem/22108354 I wrote a (pseudoSwift) example of rewriting a static function into a failable initializer:

        init?(_ weave: (A -> Location?) -> A -> Location?, _ up: A -> Location?, _ a: A) {
        	func into(t1: A) -> Location? {
        		return Location(it: t1, down: weave(into), up: up, left: const(nil), right: const(nil))
        	}
        	self = into(a)
        }

        Unfortunately this does not compile, because the assignment of an Optional type to self is illegal. Instead, one has to write:

        init?(_ weave: (A -> Location?) -> A -> Location?, _ up: A -> Location?, _ a: A) {
        	func into(t1: A) -> Location? {
        		return Location(it: t1, down: weave(into), up: up, left: const(nil), right: const(nil))
        	}
        	if let location = into(a) {
        		self = location
        	} else {
        		return nil
        	}
        	// note: one can use an equivalent guard clause:
        	// guard let location = into(a) else { return nil }
        	// self = location
        }

        While this has the virtue of actually compiling today, itâ€™s a lot of extra syntax to do essentially the same thing: return `nil` if the assigned value was `nil`, or else assign the (non-`nil`) value.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        N/A

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        This would presumably only apply to value types since if I recall correctly assignment to self is only legal in value type initializers.
