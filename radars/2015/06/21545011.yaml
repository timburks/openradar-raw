    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the last phases of our project, we were making 2 or 3 builds per day.\r\nWhenever a new build is uploaded to TestFlight and selected for testing, the old ones are no longer available for testing.\r\nInternal testers are able to download the new build immediately and can continue testing.\r\nExternal testers however need to wait until the build passes through the review process, which takes half a day.. sometimes more.\r\nUsually by the time the old build passes review, a new build has been made already. So as a developer i have an option to either stall the new build and wait for all my external testers to download the old one or upload a new build, test it internally again and wait for the review of the new one again.\r\nIf i choose the latter, the external testers will never have a chance to test the product.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it make sense to separate those two groups, so a new internal build does not stop testing on the old one for external testers?"
