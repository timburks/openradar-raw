    description: "Summary:\r\nI created an app that monitor an iBeacon region. It works perfectly until after the iPhone 5c is rebooted. Then it does not work anymore.\r\n\r\nIf I unregister the iBeacon region and then re-register it, then it works normally again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe following requires an iPhone 5s and an iPad:\r\n\r\n1. Write a custom app that monitor a CLBeaconRegion with specific proximity UUID from iPad AirLocate app.\r\n  - custom app requires permissions for location access (always), background access, and local notification.\r\n  - custom app monitor the specified CLBeaconRegion using CLLocationManager startMonitoringForRegion.\r\n  - custom app will present a local notification on CLLOcationManager didEnterRegion and didExitRegion.\r\n2. Install custom app on iPhone 5s.\r\n3. Run custom app, and start monitored the beacon region.\r\n4. Terminate the custom app by pressing the home button twice, and swiping up on the custom app.\r\n5. Lock the iPhone 5s by pressing the power button.\r\n6. Install AirLocate sample app on iPad.\r\n6. Start AirLocate on iPad to become an iBeacon using the spefiic UUID on the custom iPhone app.\r\n7. Custom app on iPhone 5s presents a local notification on the didEnterRegion.\r\n  - this happen almost immediately after the iBeacon is activated on iPad.\r\n8. Stop AirLocate on iPad as an iBeacon.\r\n9. Custom app on iPhone 5s presents a local notification on the didExitRegion.\r\n  - this happen about 35s after the iBeacon is deactivated on iPad.\r\n10. Power off iPhone 5s.\r\n  - hold the power button until the power off slider appear.\r\n  - slide the slider to power off the phone.\r\n11. Power on iPhone 5s.\r\n12. Unlock iPhone 5s using (require passcode if set)\r\n13. Lock the iPhone 5s by pressing the power button once.\r\n14. Start AirLocate on iPad to become an iBeacon using the spefiic UUID on the custom iPhone app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCustom app on iPhone 5s should present a local notification on the didEnterRegion.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification is presented.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have also tested this on iPhone 5c (16GB), iOS 8.3 (12F70). The issue does NOT present itself on iPhone 5c.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 32GB"
