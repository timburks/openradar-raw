    description: "If a user goes through the Photos.app 'buy more iCloud space to enable iCloud Photo Library' flow and does not have a valid card on file, the in-app page which the user is presented with to enter a valid card has a major, blocking bug: the aspect radio of the American Express® Card logo is wrong! \r\n\r\nThis offends my sensibilities! It must be fixed in short order. I am unsure if the issue is present on 10.10.3, but if it is that is even worse!\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (3,000 characters maximum)\r\n\r\n1. Make a new iCloud account, do not upgrade it beyond the 5gb free tier, do not attach a payment method.\r\n\r\n2. Launch Photos.app without having previously upgraded to iCloud Photo Library.\r\n\r\n3. Import enough photos so as to go over the 5gb free-tier Limit\r\n\r\n4. Try to enable iCloud Photo Library. Get directed to the 'how do you want to pay us' page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results (3,000 characters maximum)\r\n\r\nBe presented with glorious, HiDPI card logos in the correct aspect ratio so as to encourage me to give Apple money.\r\n\r\nActual Results (3,000 characters maximum)\r\n\r\nSEA OF NON RETINA ASSETS IN THE WRONG ASPECT RATIO OH GOD NO SAVE US\r\n\r\nOS X Version/Build*\r\n\r\n14E36b\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes (1,000 characters maximum)\r\n\r\nDrinking multiple alcoholic beverages functions as a workaround, but only temporarily."
