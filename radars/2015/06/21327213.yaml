    description: "I have read and heard about the changes being made to canOpenURL and openURL in iOS9. Instead of making any of those changes, I suggest a user permission question is implemented for each URL an app wants to open/check for. \r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\"Launcher\" would like to open \"Messages\" [Don't allow] [Ok].\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n\"Launcher\" would like to be able to open the following 12 apps:\r\n- A\r\n- B\r\n- C\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way, all the good ways these methods are being used today will remain unaffected. However, for apps scanning devices to gather information about what apps a user have installed, it would be harder to keep doing that."
