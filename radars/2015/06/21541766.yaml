    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen compiling an app for iOS 7 using XCode 7.0 Beta 2 I encountered two problems as soon as I extend the WKWebView: EXC_BAD_ACCESS on accessing static variables on an iOS 7.1.1 device and EXC_BAD_ACCESS on launch in debug mode on iOS 9 device.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nWhen running on iOS 7.1.1 I get a crash in my sample program when I access a static variable.\r\nDebugging revealed that this crash only happens when I write an extension for the WKWebView. It does not change a thing if there are methods in this extension or not. The declaration itself is enough.\r\nAs soon as I remove the protocol VCWebViewProvider from my WKWebView extension the program runs fine.\r\n\r\nI guess there is a problem because I add an extension with a protocol to a class which is not available in iOS 7. I marked the extension as available in iOS 8 but this is not changing the behavior.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I get a crash in the AppDelegate when I want to run the app on iOS 9. The error does not happen when I change the deployment target to iOS 8 and does not produce a crash when I run the app without attaching the debugger but run the app directly from the springboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open XCode project\r\n2. Run on iOS 7.1 device (not simulator)\r\n3. App crashes in line 43 with EXC_BAD_ACCESS in ViewController.swift\r\n4. Run on iOS 9 device\r\n5. App crashes in AppDelegate.swift in line 13\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp does not crash at all.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 beta 2 (7A121l)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Deployment target 8.0. Remove protocol from WKWebView extension\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 7 device: iPad 3 (A1416) running iOS 7.1.1 (11D201)\r\niOS 9 device: iPad Air 2 (A1567) running iOS 9.0 Beta 2 (13A4280e)"
