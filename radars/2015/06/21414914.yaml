        Summary:
        In situations when changing the location of a number of files/groups in a row using the file inspector, it would be convenient to be able to just drag the file/folder you want the selected item to point to onto the inspector area rather than having to go through the save panel

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select a group in the project navigator on the left
        2. Open the inspector pane on the right and click the File Inspector icon at the top
        3. Switch to the Finder and find a folder that you want to assign the group to correspond to
        4. Drag the folder from the Finder and drop it onto the Location/Full Path section of the file inspector

        Expected Results:
        The inspector should accept the drop and change the selected group to point to the dropped folder

        Actual Results:
        The drop is not accepted, and the only way to change the group's location is to click the little folder icon in the inspector
