        In WWDC 2014 Session 228 (A Look Inside Presentation Controllers) the "LookInside" sample app was demoed. Specifically, at the 41:19 timestamp it was shown how the sample app switches from a sidebar view controller to a full size view controller for a horizontally compact environment such as iPhone.

        I downloaded the sample code and tried with the Resizable iPad Simulator (iOS 8.3) set to Width=320 and "Compact". However the app still uses the sidebar view controller. The same holds true when launching in iPhone Simulator or on an actual iPhone running iOS 8.3 or 9.0 beta 2.

        However on an iPhone running iOS 8.0.2 the code works fine and AAPLOverlayViewController is displayed full screen.

        So somewhere between 8.0.2 and 8.3 there must have been introduced a bug.
