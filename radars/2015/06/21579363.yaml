        Summary:
        When sending a file to someone using Messages, if I hit spacebar to use QuickLook and then once again to dismiss the preview, the Messages window is no longer in focus and I cannot navigate the dialog using the keyboard until I click in it or otherwise activate the app (i.e. cmd-tab away and then back again, click the icon in the Dock).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a conversation in Messages
        2. press ⌥⌘F to send a file (or select the menu item Buddies → Send File…)
        3. Press the down arrow to select the first file (or select a file with the mouse)
        4. Press spacebar to use QuickLook
        5. Press spacebar to dismiss QuickLook
        6. Try to press the down or up arrow or otherwise navigate the open dialog with the keyboard

        Expected Results:
        I expect the open dialog to respond to my key presses.

        Actual Results:
        The open dialog does not respond to my key presses.
