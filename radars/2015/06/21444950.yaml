    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting UIImagePicker to select a movie from photo gallery, it shows albums that do not contain any movies and their description is misleading\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple app that presents an image picker for selecting a movie from photo gallery\r\nSample code:\r\n        let pickerVC = UIImagePickerController()\r\n        pickerVC.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.PhotoLibrary\r\n        pickerVC.mediaTypes = [kUTTypeMovie as String]\r\n        self.presentViewController(pickerVC, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n\r\n2. Run application on the device that has albums without movies\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlbums that do not contain only movies are not listed at all.\r\nEach list item displays\r\n- a preview of contained movie(s)\r\n- album name\r\n- amount of contained movies\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll albums are shown\r\nAlbum description shows the total (movies + images) number of items in the album\r\nAlbum preview displays previews of contained images (not movies)"
