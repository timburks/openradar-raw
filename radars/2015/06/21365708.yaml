    description: "Summary:\r\nSchools in Austria would like to roll out iPad Minis for pupils. The DEP would be key for doing that in a manageable fashion at scale.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Try to enroll into DEP with an Austrian Address\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- should be able to join the DEP\r\n- should be able to manage scale deployments of iPads at an Austrian school\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- you receive the message \"Deployment Programs are not available in your country\"\r\n- see attached screenshot\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTechnically we believe that DEP and volume purchasing for Austria should be simple to manifest, since there is factually no difference between next door Germany which has these programs.\r\n\r\nTax-wise the VAT has been unified in the EU (in Jan 2015)to be chargeable at the location of the purchaser. So iTunes has to have put the framework in place to do that for the app store anyway.\r\n\r\nWe believe that failure to introduce DEP to Austria in a timely fashion will cause schools to execute their plans to purchase iPad Minis and thus undermine Apple's worldwide leadership when it comes to providing hardware for education institutions."
