    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Apple Media Service (AMS) is connected while media was already playing for a while, the initial this is reported by AMS ElapsedTime is erroneous, sometimes even negative (see attached hex dump of negative time).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair an AMS enabled accessory with and iOS device\r\n2. Toggle Bluetooth OFF on the iOS device\r\n3. Start media playback, for example using the Apple Music app\r\n4. Let the media play for 30 secs or so (just let it continue playing after this step)\r\n5. Toggle Bluetooth back ON on the iOS device.\r\n6. Let the accessory connect to the iOS device again\r\n8. Let the accessory set up AMS (subscribe, register for entity updates, etc.)\r\n9. When AMS sends the first update for the Playback info attribute of the Player entity, observe that the ElapsedTime is completely off from the actual elapsed time as seen in the iOS Music app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ElapsedTime should always contain approx. the same time as the elapsed time that is reported by the iOS app that is playing back the media.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe ElapsedTime is erroneous when AMS is connected after the media playback has started.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ams-negative-elapsed-time.txt' was successfully uploaded."
