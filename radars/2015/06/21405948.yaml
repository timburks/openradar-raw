    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the German language there are two possible translations for the word *you*. The formal *Sie* and the informal *Du*. People who don't know each other personally usually use the formal version. This is also how customers are addressed in marketing materials most of the time. Young people prefer to be informal.\r\n\r\nAmong those companies who try to find a friendlier tone with their customers are Apple and IKEA. No matter the product or price range, Apple's marketing at http://www.apple.com/de/ipod-shuffle or http://www.apple.com/de/watch/apple-watch-edition treats every customer equal by using the informal *Du*.\r\n\r\nBut after the customer purchases an Apple product this tone changes. The friendly messages used by Apple marketing are replaced by cold and formal localizations.\r\n\r\nWhile it is always the same Apple the customer is dealing with, one day he is treated like a friend, and the next day like a stranger. This is schizophrenic. Please decide on being either formal or informal in Germany.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCheck for formal or informal language on these pages or in these apps:\r\n\r\n- http://www.apple.com/de/macbook-pro\r\n- http://www.apple.com/de/ipad\r\n- http://www.apple.com/de/iphone\r\n- http://www.apple.com/de/retail/business/\r\n- https://appleid.apple.com/de\r\n- http://www.apple.com/de/support\r\n- Welcome screen of iTunes for OS X\r\n- iTunes Store\r\n- Welcome screen of Wallet app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tone is consistently informal\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe marketing pages are informal, while the support and app contents are formal. Apple Store for Business mixes informal with formal on the same page. iTunes Store is formal."
