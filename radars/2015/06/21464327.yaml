    description: "Summary:\r\nThe manner in which iOS's Up Next queue is implemented is really confusing because it does not match iTunes's version of the same feature (the latter of which is much more usable, and makes more sense to use). They should behave identically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Music app on iOS (or open Music on Apple TV), browse for a few albums.\r\n2. Begin playing an album immediately (call it Album A) by hitting Play on it, or by choosing \"Play Next\".\r\n3. Find another album (Album B), and on its context menu, choose \"Add to Up Next.\"\r\n4. Open up the \"Up Next\" queue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe second album added (Album B) should be inserted into the \"Up Next\" list _after_ Album A's tracks, not before theirs (and immediately after the current playing song). Playing an album should add its tracks to the regular \"Up Next\" queue, not some separate \"Up Next: Album Name\" queue.\r\n\r\nThere should be _one_ queue, and adding to it using \"Add to Up Next\" should insert it after the playing album's tracks. If I _did_ want to insert it immediately after the currently-playing track, I would choose \"Play Next\" instead of \"Add to Up Next.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the album on which I chose to \"Add to Up Next\" (Album B) inserts right after the currently-playing track, and moves Album A's remaining tracks to a separate queue (which would resume playing after all of the Up Next tracks finish). There should be _one_ streamlined queue.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4, iOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis whole \"separate queue\" business is really confusing, and it's present on Apple TV as well. PLEASE streamline it into one queue and make it behave like how iTunes does. I hate to be the guy that's like \"do what this other company does,\" but the way Rdio handles queued albums/tracks is _really_ smart. iTunes is close _enough_ to it that I enjoy queueing up music, but iOS and Apple TV make it maddening!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPad 3rd-gen, iPad mini 2 (all the iOS devices I have!), Apple TV"
