    description: "Summary:\r\nIn certain nested MOCs configuration, NSFetchRequest fetchBatchSize is ignored. This seems to be the case when the main context does not have direct access to persistent store.\r\n\r\nCode example modified from \"iPhoneCoreDataRecipes\" is provided as example.\r\n\r\nWhen the problem happens, SQL log looks like what's found in \"limit clause missing\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse attached sample data in folder - 76BFE3FF-2C24-4AAF-B18C-E229F9BA4DE7\r\nRun the attached sample code for different MOCs setup starting at RecipesAppDelegate.m L128\r\nObserve the SQL debug log generated\r\n\r\nFor \"single context\" and \"main context as parent context\" cases, fetch request behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nFor the other cases where the main context doesn't have direct access to the persistent store, fetchBatchSize is ignored\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nfetchBatchSize should be honored. i.e we should see LIMIT clause added in the SQL.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLIMIT clause is not found.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Bug report sample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
