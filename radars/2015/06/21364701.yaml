        I was trying to test the new WatchConnectivity framework on actual devices running iOS 9 and watchOS 2, and I had a few issues getting it to work. While the watch and phone apps were installed and ran on the devices, the connectivity tunnel didn't seem to be active. It seemed that isReachable was returning no, and so therefore sendMessage wasn't available and no messages were being sent between the two apps, even though both were active and the devices were paired.

        The application context didn't seem to be transferring between the devices either.

        Interestingly, repeatedly uninstalling and reinstalling the apps did eventually load them correctly and the connection was established and everything worked as you would expect. From talking to a group of engineers in the labs, it sounded like the likely issue was that the extension wasn't correctly telling the framework that it was finished being installed, so that the conditions for reachability to be true would be met.

    title: Installation of the Watch App from Xcode Doesn't Completely Hook Up the Connection to tell WatchConnectivity that the app is Installed and Reachable
