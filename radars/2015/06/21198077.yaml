    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a UIAlertController with UIAlertControllerStyleActionSheet as it's preferred style, and adding a button with UIAlertActionStyleCancel results in display problems. The presented _UIPopoverView's frame isn't large enough to display the whole action sheet.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the last two screenshots, using Reveal it's shown the Cancel button is there but cut off by the bounds of the popover view.\r\n\r\nI've posted demo code on Github, so see the problem in action: https://github.com/RuudPuts/AlertControllerRadar\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a button to the view\r\n2. Create a touchUpInside handler which displays a UIAlertController with preferred style UIAlertControllerStyleActionSheet\r\n3. Add an action to the alertController, with type UIAlertActionStyleCancel\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen running the project, and tapping the button an ActionSheet is shown in an popover at location of the button. The ActionSheet is large enough to show the title, message and the cancel button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen running the project, and tapping the button an ActionSheet is shown in an popover at location of the button. The ActionSheet only shows the title and message, cutting off the Cancel button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFound on device running 8.1, also appears with iOS 8.3 on simulator. Using iOS SDK 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air (MGL12HC/A) - 16GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-06-02 at 09.09.36.png', 'Screen Shot 2015-06-02 at 09.09.34.png', 'Screen Shot 2015-06-02 at 09.18.50.png' and 'Screen Shot 2015-06-02 at 09.18.28.png' were successfully uploaded."
