        When using NSUserActivity with eligibleForSearch, certain userInfo keys, notably "category" and "categoryID" seem to be filtered.

        When the user selects such a search result from the system search UI, userActivity.userInfo is an empty dictionary. So the "category" or "categoryID" key was filtered.

        Other keys, even "categoryId" (with a lower case "d"), work just fine.


        This unpredictable behavior costed us hours and was a nightmare to debug!
