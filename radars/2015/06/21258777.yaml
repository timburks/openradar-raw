    description: "Summary:\r\nOften when I open a new tab, soon after the page loads Safari will spin for many minutes. During this time CPU usage is 100% and memory grows and grows.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Browse normally as you would throughout the day, periodically opening new tabs. (I typically keep about 5 tabs open persistently, and open more as needed.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOpening a new tab should not cause a multi-minute spin and consume 10s of gigabytes of memory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe spin that was ongoing when I started filing this eventually consumed over 58GB of memory, prompting the system \"Out of memory\" dialog to appear (which I had never seen before!). The spin lasted more than 5 minutes before the dialog appeared. Memory usage was climbing at about 100MB/sec. Sometimes the spin will recover before reaching this point, but usually I lose patience and force quit Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3\r\nSafari 8.0.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached an Instruments trace of Safari while the spin was occurring. It shows near-constant allocations of NSSet and CFURL objects.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Safari SharedLinksAddFeedController spin.trace.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2015-06-05 at 9.32.08 AM.png' were successfully uploaded."
