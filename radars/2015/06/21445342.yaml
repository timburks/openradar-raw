    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen copying text from a web view to the pasteboard, valuable metadata is included in the form of an \"Apple Web Archive pasteboard type.\" This data includes both source and styling information that would be valuable when sharing to a Share Extension.\r\n\r\nWhen sharing text from a web view, `SLComposeServiceViewController.extensionContext.inputItems` should provide both the selected text and a web archive representation of that text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select text within a web view (Safari or otherwise)\r\n2. Copy to pasteboard to inspect Web Archive\r\n3. Select same text\r\n4. Share to a custom Share Extension\r\n5. Observe an unfortunate lack of Web Archive attachment\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe inclusion of a Web Archive attachment in the Extension's context.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the plain text, which is a redundant copy of the included `contentText`."
