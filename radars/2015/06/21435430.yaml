        Summary:
        Converting an array of type `[String]` to a `[CVarArgType]` doesn't work as expected. Converting literal arrays works fine but converting existing array references crashes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See the attached playground.
        1. let array = ["a", "b"].map { $0 as CVarArgType } // Works fine
        2. let brokenArray = ["a", "b"]
        3. brokenArray as [CVarArgType] // Doesn't work
        4. brokenArray.map { $0 as CVarArgType } // Works fine

        Expected Results:
        You should be able to cast a `[String]` to `[CVarArgType]`

        Actual Results:
        You have to map the conversion over the array rather than casting with `as`
