    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a WKWebView fails to load due to a network error, its URL property is nilled out, so you can't call reload to try again. It's possible to track the URL in a separate state and pass it to loadRequest(), but that is messy as you must update that state variable as the user navigates in the web view.\r\n\r\nIt seems unnecessary to nil out the URL field in the event of a network failure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project in Xcode 6.3\r\n2. Disable the network interface\r\n3. Compile and run the project. An alert is displayed after the network request fails.\r\n4. Re-enable the network interface\r\n5. Tap the Reload button in the alert\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe web view should load the requested URL\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe web view is blank\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote the attached project is named WKWebViewCrash only because I'm using it to reproduce a similar bug when the web process crashes. The current bug is not a crashing bug.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac running Yosemite and iPhone Simulator 8+ or iPhone running iOS 8+\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WKWebViewCrash.zip' was successfully uploaded."
