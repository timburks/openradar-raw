        Summary:
        Currently, Spotlight always shows Emoji Type as one of my top apps, but it's just a dummy app that contains a keyboard extension. These types of apps should only show up in Spotlight if I actually regularly open the app. In the case of Emoji Type, I never open the containing app, but I do use the keyboard.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install an app with a keyboard extension.
        2. Never use the app, but use the keyboard regularly
        3. The app will appear in Spotlight

        Expected Results:
        I should never see apps in Spotlight that I don't actually use.

        Actual Results:
        I see an app in Spotlight all day as my top app that I never, ever open.
