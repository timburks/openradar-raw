    description: As a contractor I’ve been added as a team member to many developer portals over the years. Also, by virtue of being a contractor, I am generally *not* made an agent or admin of those portals. Consequentially I’m forever trapped with access to (and some control over) a large set of resources that I no longer want and generally shouldn’t have. Please allow me to remove myself from these portals without requiring agent/admin privileges.
