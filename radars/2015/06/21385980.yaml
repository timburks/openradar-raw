    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://21372721\r\n\r\nWhoever redesigned developer.apple.com doesn’t appear to understand how developers use it.\r\n\r\nThe marketing information presented on the page is useful only ONCE (to learn about the existence of new Apple technologies.)\r\n\r\nThe technical information on the page is a reference that gets used EVERY DAY by thousands of developers. And it’s terribly unusable.\r\n\r\nWe need to look up things like API diffs, release notes, sample code, downloads, certificates & provisioning: and all of these things are REALLY HARD to find in the new layout. There’s no consistency for where to find this information (some is in the body text, some is in the bottom navigation.)\r\n\r\nAnd I’m still trying to figure out how to download iOS 9 so I can start testing it on my devices. You know, making all that marketing copy I just read about into a reality.\r\n\r\nThe marketing information is important, but don’t let it hide the technical information. Put the things developers use frequently all in one place."
