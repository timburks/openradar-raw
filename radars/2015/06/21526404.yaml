        Summary:
        Xcode doesn't support for some Layout Constraint setup in Storyboard. In my case is label’s first baseline to image view’s bottom

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create iOS project
        2. Open Storyboard
        3. Add a label and a image view into view
        4. Try to add a constraint that base on label’s first baseline attribute to image view’s bottom attribute

        Expected Results:
        Can set that constraint

        Actual Results:
        Xcode won’t allow that

        Regression:


        Notes:
        This should work because it can create this constraint in code.
