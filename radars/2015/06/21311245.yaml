    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://20807572\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI maintain a simple app where I work that we distribute with an Enterprise Provisioning profile. Last week it started crashing on launch. No error message or any other information. Just wouldn't start. Today I plugged my phone into Xcode to look at the logs, where I found the problem: Our enterprise provisioning profile had expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be super helpful if a useful error message could be displayed in such a situation. A simple message to the effect that the provisioning profile has expired would be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I don't suppose there's a way to create a profile that lasts any longer than a year, is there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Archive an app with an expired enterprise provisioning profile.\r\n\r\n* Install it on your iOS device\r\n\r\n* Launch it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app refuses to launch, provides an error message explaining to the user why it won't launch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app start screen appears then disappears with no explanation. It looks like a serious startup crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\niOS 8.x\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone, iPad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
