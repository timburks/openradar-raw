    description: "Access control annotations are far too verbose and require too much effort to maintain, modify, promote, and demote through the lifecycle of coding.\n\npublic struct Token {\n    public let token: Character\n    public let content: String\n    \n    public let column: Int\n    public let line: Int\n}\n\nNumber of characters = 143 (or 343 if I include the required init() as the generated one is internal).\n\nstruct Token {\n   let token: Character\n   let content: String\n    \n   let column: Int\n   let line: Int\n}\n\nNumber of characters = 104\n\nThat’s nearly 30% of the code is just for “public”. \n\nThe “workaround” for this is online all of your decls:\n\n    public let token: Character,\n        content: String,\n        column: Int,\n        line: Int\n\nOr on a single line:\n\n    public let token: Character, content: String, column: Int, line: Int\n\nThat’s just terrible and does not scale past the most trivial of types. C++ does a much better job here when handling member access control:\n\npublic struct Token {\npublic:\n   let token: Character\n   let content: String\n    \n   let column: Int\n   let line: Int\n}\n\nWe need something better."
