        Summary:
        When restoring my phone in iOS 8, my iPhone automatically filled the verification code when the text arrived, since at this point I can't go check my texts to look at the code - the phone hasn't been set up yet. In iOS 9, the text is received, but the code never fills. To workaround this, I have to skip iCloud Keychain verification in setup and come back to it later.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set up iCloud Keychain when restoring your iPhone
        2. Say you want to verify via text
        3. Verification code is never filled by text

        Expected Results:
        When the text is received, the verification code in setup should automatically fill in.

        Actual Results:
        I sit there with a blank verification code until I decide to skip iCloud Keychain setup.
