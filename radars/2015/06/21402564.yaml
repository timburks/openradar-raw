    description: "Summary:\r\nIn \"WWDC2015 804 - Introducing the New System Fonts\" there was some lengthy explanation on how the new SF font defaults to proportional number rendering instead of monospaced rendering. Also there was mentioning of NSFont.monospacedDigitsSystemFontOfSize(mySize weight:) which seems to be missing it's UIKit counterpart on UIFont.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry setting a font with monospaced digit rendering UILabel is not possible, since UIFont doesn't have a method to create such an object. Also UILabel doesn't have a property to configure the desired numeral rendering mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUILabel is capable of displaying monospaced numerals.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUILabel only displays proportionally spaced numerals on apps linked against iOS 9 SDK.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nRunning an App with target iOS 9 on Xcode 7.0 beta (7A120f) on OS 10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo workaround found so far."
