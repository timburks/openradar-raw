    description: "The only thing that prevents me from using SFSafariViewController instead of my own UIWebView/WKWebView wrapper is the the lack of delegate callback for URL loading.\r\n\r\nI understand that for protecting user’s privacy general sniffing is forbidden. However, prescribed and limited URL detection is non-intrusive and very useful for users. For example, if a Twitter app knows that user taps a link to a tweet it can present a native tweet view with better user experience.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest that developers are allowed to specify in app’s info.plist several URL domains that the app wants to process and SFSafariViewController send delegate calls when navigating to matching URLs."
