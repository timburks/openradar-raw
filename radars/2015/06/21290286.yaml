        Summary:
        You can write a method named e.g. return (or catch, or defer, etc) but you have to put backticks around it. But in most places where you’re using the symbol it’s already disambiguated by where it’s occuring syntactically.

        For example, you should be able to do this:

        func func() {}

        The latter occurrence of “func” is unambiguous. It can’t be the start of another function; that is not how these things work. Unfortunately, nobody told the lexer that.

        If the parser were scannerless the lexer’s problems wouldn’t be my problem.
