    description: "UISlider is accessible by default. Its accessibility value can be specified along with its label and hint in order to provide good voice over information.\r\n\r\nHowever the amount by which the value is incremented/decremented when swiping up or down cannot be easily customized. \r\n\r\nSpecifying the amount of incrementation/decrementation can only be performed by overriding the `accessibilityIncrement()` or `accessibilityDecrement()` respectively.\r\n\r\nAs a user I would like to be able to specify the increment or decrement amount of a UISlider for accessibility directly. For instance:\r\n`slider.accessibilityIncrement = 5/100`\r\n\r\nDoing so would greatly simplify implementation of custom UISlider and contribute to the spread of accessibility in iOS applications"
