    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an inline link is long-pressed in Safari, an action sheet with only a few built-in options is displayed. It would be much better if a UIActivityViewController was presented or an Action Sheet with share button was presented instead; this would allow all of the share and action extensions that the user has enabled to act on the URL being interacted with.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLong-press an inline link in Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA UIActivityViewController or an action sheet with a share button should be displayed with system actions as well as any action and share extensions that the user has enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn action sheet with only a few select built-in options is displayed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also: rdar://21523690"
