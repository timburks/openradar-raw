    description: "Summary:\r\nI have code like this in a class that has been working great on in Xcode 6 and earlier:\r\n\r\n    id lm = NSClassFromString(@\"CLLocationManager\");\r\n    if (lm && [lm locationServicesEnabled]) { â€¦ }\r\n\r\nXcode 7 reports this as deprecated with this message:\r\n\r\n'locationServicesEnabled' is deprecated: first deprecated in iOS 4.0\r\n\r\nHowever, that deprecation is for the locationServicesEnabled instance property, but this code is calling the +locationServicesEnabled class method, which is *not* deprecated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Paste this code into an app:\r\n\r\n    id lm = NSClassFromString(@\"CLLocationManager\");\r\n    if (lm && [lm locationServicesEnabled]) NSLog(@\"YES\");\r\n\r\n2. Build the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGot warning:\r\n\r\n  'locationServicesEnabled' is deprecated: first deprecated in iOS 4.0\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in Xcode 7 beta 1 (7A120f), but not Xcode 6 or earlier.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
