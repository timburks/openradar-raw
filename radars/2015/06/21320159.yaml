        Summary:
        For applications that use a WKWebView to provide a rich text editor experience (i.e. displaying HTML and allowing it to be edited) there is currently no proper way to hook into the inputAccessoryView which displays navigation controls by default, which are often redundant when a single ‘page’ is being displayed. It can be removed or replaced via swizzling, but this is not ideal.

        It would be great if the new inputAccessoryItem functionality on UITextInput and its related classes were also available on WKContentView via WKWebView, so we could add our own buttons for custom functionality like image insertion and the like.
