    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://21373331\r\n\r\nLet’s face it: bugreport.apple.com is, in technical terms, needs improvement.\r\n\r\nIt’s slow, looks bad, and makes filing bugs dreadful for any iOS, Mac (and Watch!) developer. This is, of course, bad for developers, it’s bad for the users, and ultimately, bad for Apple.\r\n\r\nThe experience of reporting bugs (by people who aren’t paid to do so, yet ultimately help Apple) should be as simple and easy as possible.\r\n\r\nTime to get real.\r\n\r\nWe need new bugreport.apple.com.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re feeling generous, a Mac app for filing bugs, or an official JSON API so that the community can make one, would be wonderful.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\n\r\nSomething like http://quickradar.com."
