    description: I was sitting on the Max (Portland’s light rail system) when my watch alerted me that had had 7 calories left to meet my goal.  I remained sitting in my seat and about 10 minutes later it alerted me that I had met my goal.  While I may have burned 7 calories just existing I don’t think that is what it is supposed to be counting.
