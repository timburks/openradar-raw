    description: The new "Any" names like AnyGenerator, AnySequence, etc. conflate implementation hiding (which is often a benefit) with the weak typing of Any and AnyObject (which are types to be avoided). "Any" should be reserved for the latter types so that it can be treated as suspicious. The previous GeneratorOf/SequenceOf names were clearer.
