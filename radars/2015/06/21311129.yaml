    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://21310773\n\nSummary:\r\nEnterprise app installation on iOS 7 works fine.  Upgrading to iOS 8 prevents installing/updating the same application.  Even if the application is deleted a new install is no longer possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the Enterprise application on iOS 7\r\n2. Upgrade to iOS 8\r\n3. Try to install the same application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo be able to successfully install/upgrade the Enterprise application on both iOS 7 and iOS 8\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot being able to install on iOS 8 whereas the same app works fine on iOS 7.  Here are some of the errors and logs for when the upgrade/installation fails.\r\n\r\n1. No visual feedback of an installation try.  The log files produce the following error even after the application was deleted.\r\nIgnore manifest download, already have bundleID: â€¦\r\n\r\n2. Visual feedback of a failed installation (grayed icon).  All further attempts to upgrade/install fail as well.  The log files show the following error.\r\n<Error>: profile not valid: 0xe8008011\r\n<Error>: 0x385000 install_embedded_profile: Could not install embedded profile: 0xe8008011\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem is intermittent but is a definite bug in that the same app will work on some iPads with iOS 8 and not on others.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI filed a radar 21309570 that seems related to this problem.\r\n\r\nSeems related to these discussions:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/25733299/ios-8-cant-install-enterprise-app\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/23682083/xcodebuild-not-copying-file-from-app\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/28195564/enterprise-app-deployment-doesnt-install-on-ios-8-1-3\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204245"
