        Summary:
        Caching Server should have an option to Pre-Cache all/some iOS updates. Ideally it should include the following:
        	1. Admin created array of specific model identifiers to cache.
        	2. Admin invoked to download all iOS updates currently signed by Apple.
        	3. Ran as a service (similar to Apple updates) to ensure all future iOS updates are cached.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Setup Caching Server

        Expected Results:
        Option to pre-cache all iOS updates

        Actual Results:
        Nothing currently available.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        Please see https://glencode.net/cachewarmer/ for an example of what I would like to see. If someone else can do this, you guys can as well.
