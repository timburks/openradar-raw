        Summary:
        If a user connects to iCloud, they can then reset AD mobile accounts remotely.

        This can lead to these potential issues:
        1. User forgets AD password, resets account and is no longer in sync with the server.
        2. If a malicious user gains access to the Apple ID, they can use it to unlock all accounts on machine remotely.
        3. User can change password of other users on machine.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. User signs into iCloud on a AD bound machine
        2a. Reset password through icloud.com
        2b. Reset password of any account on machine through System Preferences

        Expected Results:
        iCloud should not be able to reset passwords for mobile accounts.

        Actual Results:
        iCloud can currently reset passwords for mobile accounts.

        Regression:
