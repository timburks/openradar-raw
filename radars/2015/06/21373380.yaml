        1. Be on iPad
        2. Open some sort of a form, for instance the “New Event” popover in Calendar

        Now, it would be nice to be able to quickly switch to the next input field in the form by tapping “V” / “^” buttons on the keyboard — just like you can in Safari/WebKit views.

        It’s especially useful when holding an iPad mini in two hands in portrait. One can easily use and type on the keyboard with two thumbs, but reaching for the next input field is kind of annoying.

        In other iPad contexts, albeit less critical, this would still be very useful.
