    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that all NSUserNotification in a single application have to be either banners or alerts, there is no way to specify that one NSUserNotification is a banner and one is an alert.\r\n\r\nI don't understand this at all - obviously some notifications are just that - notifications that something happened, no need to necessarily stay on the screen.  Other notifications (especially in modern versions) offer replies or multiple buttons or other actions, and these need to be displayed as an alert.\r\n\r\nBut to get the latter, all notifications in an application have to be alerts - this seems nuts to meâ€¦?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
