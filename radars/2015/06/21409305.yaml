    description: "Summary:\r\nPhotos.app does not provide any information which would indicate the image being shared via UIActivityViewController is from a burst sequence. There is a desire for an app extension to operate on the entire sequence of images from a burst.  We believe the best way to accomplish this with the current extension architecture is to add the burst identifier to the userInfo dictionary on the NSExtensionItem instance.  We would then use the burst identifier to query Photos.framework for related burst images.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Photos.app\r\n2. Find a burst sequence and select it\r\n3. Tap the Share button\r\n4. Select an app extension\r\n5. In app extension inspect the extensionContext property and its related properties.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome indication the shared image is from a burst. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no indication this is an image from a burst sequence.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 32GB"
