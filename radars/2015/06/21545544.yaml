    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using dictation, for example to write a message, one additional space is systematically added before certain punctuation marks like ‘.’ (dot) or ‘,’ (comma).\r\nDuring dictation, before tapping ‘OK’, when the text appears as it's spoken by the user, everything looks fine. It's only when the user taps on ‘OK’, and gets presented the choice to send the message as a sound bite or as text, that the extra spaces appear. Two of the screenshots show this (in French), [IMG_2539] and [IMG_2540].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Bring up the interface to send text (either by responding to a message, by sending a new message, or others) with the list of smart replies and the two buttons at the bottom to send an emoji or to use dictation.\r\n2. Tap the button to start dictation.\r\n3. Start dictating a message, saying the punctuation out loud, like “Hello comma this is a message dot”. [IMG_2539]\r\n4. Tap ‘OK’ on the top right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe next screen shows a choice between sending the message as a sound bite or as text (with the correct settings). The text reads “Hello, this is a message.”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe next screen shows a choice between sending the message as a sound bite or as text (with the correct settings). The text reads “Hello , this is a message .”. [IMG_2540]\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0 (13S5255d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n‘General’ > ‘Language & Region’ >\r\n• ‘Language’ set to French.\r\n• ‘Region’ set to France.\r\n• ‘Calendar’ set to Gregorian.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no problem if the user only uses Siri. Two of the screenshots show this (in French):\r\n1. Bring Siri by holding the Digital Crown, or say “Hey Siri”.\r\n2. Say something like “Sent a message to Leo saying hello comma this is a message dot”. [IMG_2541]\r\n3. Siri will then bring the sheet to send the message with the right recipient, but most importantly the text with the right ponctuation: “Hello, this is a message.”.
