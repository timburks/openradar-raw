        Summary:

        Quite often when you fix failing XCTestCases, re-run the test target and all tests succeeded, the build results are not updated and appear to still be broken, even though the build and test run completed successfully

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open a project with unit tests
        2. Break a test
        3. Observe errors are highlight in red in-line, in the toolbar, Navigator and Debug areas
        4. Fix the test again
        5. Re-run the test target
        6. Observe the “Test Succeeded” notification HUD is displayed and no failures are reported in the Debug area.
        7. Observe errors are still shown in red in-line, in the toolbar, Navigator.

        Expected Results:

        I would expect the Xcode UI to be consistently updated with actual tests results.

        Actual Results:

        The Xcode UI still presents as though there are failing tests, even though the test run succeeded.

        Regression:

        Has been a problem as long as I remember.
