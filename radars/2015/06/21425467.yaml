    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting the UIActivityViewController's More modal, there is no way to know when the modal has been presented or dismissed without resorting to private APIs. This is important in our case since the application uses the .Default status bar styling and the More modal has a white background resulting in the status bar to be hidden in the background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set application status bar style to .Default\r\n2. Launch a UIActivityViewController with a More option\r\n3. Launch More modal\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome sort of callback to trigger a UI update\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo callbacks of any kind\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1171516 for the issue as it relates to a feature we're trying to build in Firefox for iOS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone, iPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
