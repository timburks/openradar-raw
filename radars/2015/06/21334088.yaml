    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the 'NPR News' app, tapping a story, and then tapping the 'Share' button result in the UI for a typical UIActivityViewController.  On iOS 9, the icons for all apps except for 'Mail' are missing. \r\n\r\nI have not noticed this behavior in any other apps that use UIActivityViewController but my testing has been limited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the 'NPR News' app. \r\n2. Open the app.\r\n3. Select a story from the first tab 'News'.\r\n4. Tap the 'Share' button below the story title\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the icons for the sharing-enabled apps to be there\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the 'Mail' app icon appears.  Various other apps are available to share.  Tapping on the blank spot where an icon would be (Messages, for example), results in the correct behavior - I see the Message controller appear. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta"
