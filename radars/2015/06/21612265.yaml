    description: "Summary:\n\nI’d like to see a non-hacky way of detecting whether my app is multitasking. The use-case I have in mind is as follows: my app stores a list of bookmarks. If the app is multtasking I’d like the option of sending the bookmark to Safari (presumably in the other window) rather than to the internal web view. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nFind API for checking whether current app is multi-tasking.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nFind one and use it!\n\nActual Results:\n\nCan’t find one. \n\nRegression:\n\nNope.\n\nNotes:\n\nThis is possible by comparing UIScreen with UIWindow but that feels a bit hacky."
