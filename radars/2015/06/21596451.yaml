    description: "Summary:\r\nI inherited this xib from a client project. When I open it and try to disable the width constraint of the leftmost label, Xcode hangs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached file, This Will Hang Xcode.xib, in Xcode 6.3.2. I didn't construct this file to be malformed - I was just editing existing files in a project that someone gave me to update.\r\n2. Click on the first label, \"Store\".\r\n3. In the Size inspector, locate and double-click the \"Width Equals: 42\" label.\r\n4. Uncheck the \"Installed\" checkbox.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Store label, no longer being constrained to 42 pt wide, will show yellow lines to show that it is misplaced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode hangs. I have attached a sample from Activity Monitor that I recorded after the hang started.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.2 (6D2105)\r\nXcode 7.0 beta (7A121l)\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis does not to crash Xcode 7 beta 2, but I wanted to file it anyway in case it was only fixed by accident.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nxib: http://cl.ly/boEm\r\nActivity Monitor sample of Xcode: http://cl.ly/bnyv"
