    description: "Summary:\r\nThe workout app always reports active calories in kilojoules, even though my settings should have it report in calories. This worked fine in watchOS1.\r\n\r\nThe activities app on the watch reports calories as expected.\r\n\r\nMy system language is set to English, region format is Belgium. I've tried changing the system language but that has no effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the workout app\r\n2. Select an activity (e.g. outdoor cycling)\r\n3. select a calorie goal\r\n(4. start activity)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to set my goal in calories. Once the activity started, the app reports progress in calories.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to set my goal using kilojoules. Additionally, reporting is in kilojoules.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0 (13S5254w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
