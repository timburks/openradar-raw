    description: "Summary:\r\nI use Xcode to obtain crashreports of our iOS app. That's a very cool feature, by the way! Thanks forn this.\r\n\r\nBut, very often, i have the problem that Xcode cannot connect to apple-server to get new crashreports. But since my whole system is online, xcode refuses to talk to apple crash report server very often. other applications do have internet connection, so this should not be an issue. I can even use Xcode to load my developer identity in settings, so the problem may be somewhere in the \"getting-crashlogs\"-part.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Xcode\r\nNavigator to Organizer -> Crashes\r\nselect iOS app on the left\r\nselect \"app store\" and a current release\r\n\"Xcode is currently offline\" -> \"continue offline\" or \"try again\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll Current crashlogs are loaded when tapping \"Try again\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode is offline despite working internet connection and working developer-identity-loading in Xcode->settings\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nsee attached console.log\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nYosemite \r\nXcode 6.3.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'console.log' was successfully uploaded."
