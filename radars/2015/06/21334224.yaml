    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Messages app is being very slow showing newly received (or sent) messages.  I have noticed many times over the past day when I receive the message on my Mac or in a push notification but when I open Messages, the new message will not be there for several minutes. \r\n\r\nI'm using iMessage in this case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Engage in a dialog with someone else via Messages (iMessage)\r\n2. The Messages view will often not update with the most recent conversation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect Messages to update immediately when a message is received. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessages often did not update for several minutes after they had been received by other devices and by push notification on the same device. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta"
