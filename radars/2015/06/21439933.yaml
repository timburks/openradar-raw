    description: "The Crashes panel in the Xcode Organizer is great to view crash reports for each app distributed through the App Store or TestFlight. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is sometimes useful to share those crashlogs in other tools, like bugtracking tools. It is not currently possible, as thereâ€™s no URL to share to a single crash report, and Xcode is needed anyway to even view the crash.\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient to have a UI directly on iTunesConnect to browse and share the crash reports between developers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 beta (7A120f)"
