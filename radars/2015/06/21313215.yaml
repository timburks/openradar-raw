        Summary:
        For a long time, Mac OS has had the ability to add links to the dock. There are however 2 significant limitations to doing this:

        1. Links only get to live on the side with folders and the trash can.
        2. All links get the same generic globe (a huge improvement over the weird @ spring icon, but still generic).

        Many website act like an app would, and user’s don’t think “I want to go to a website in Safari“ but instead, “I want to open Mint.com.“ For this reasons, links should be able to be treated just like an app would be, appearing in the dock and in launch center similar to the way you can add a website to the home screen on iOS. Instead of the generic link icon, they should use the same full-size icons that Safari now uses for favorite sites.

        Even better, the web app api on iOS should be extended to the Mac so that adding a website that want’s to function as an app should cause the website to be open in it’s own website specific browser, with optimized UI for a single website.
