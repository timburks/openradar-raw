        Summary:
        While working in interface builder if you have a Pin menu open and, without dismissing it, you click on “Resolve Auto Layout” menu, both menus will be visible and Resolve… menu won’t be clickable.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Select and view in Interface Builder storyboard
        Click Pin menu (bottom right)
        Without dismissing Pin menu, click Resolve Auto Layout icon (bottom right)

        Expected Results:
        Pin menu should be dismissed, Resolve… menu should be presented. Appropriate menu items of the Resolve… menu should be enabled.

        Actual Results:
        Both menus are visible, all items of Resolve… menu are disabled.

        Notes:
        The bug has been around for at least several major versions, I hope, despite minor nature of it, it can make it in the Xcode 7 GM :)
        Have a great day!
