        Summary:

        It's very hard to create smooth chained animations when many methods that animate views do not have a completion handler.


        Steps to Reproduce:

        Try to write code that calls -[UIScrollView scrollRectToVisible:rect animated:YES] and does something exactly when the scroll view finishes scrolling. You can either handle -[scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation:] (ugly, the code is completely disconnected from the original animation) or figure out how long the standard animation takes and do dispatch_after (even uglier, how long it takes is not documented and it _will_ change eventually, etc).


        Expected Results:

        [self.scrollView scrollRectToVisible:rect animated:YES completion:^() {
        	// do something when the animation finishes
        }];
