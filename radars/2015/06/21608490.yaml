    description: "Summary:\r\nFour-char code constants (typeBoolean, keyAETarget, etc) declared as enums in and CoreServices/AE and Carbon/OpenScripting framework headers are not explicitly typed so Swift assumes them to be Ints. This prevents their use NSAppleEventDescriptor and other APIs that require OSType/DescType/AEKeyword, i.e. UInt32. Annotating these enums with the correct type should fix this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta (7A121l)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is unclear whether Apple encourage or discourage the use of these constants. While defined in legacy Carbon APIs, they are still necessary when developing new code with Cocoa APIs such as NSAppleEventDescriptor and OSAKit. It would be very helpful if some kind of clarification could be added to headers and documentation on recommended practice for 3rd-party developers."
