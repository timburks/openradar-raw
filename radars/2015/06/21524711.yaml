    description: "Duplicate of 21027933 (Open)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nEverytime I enter several tasks into my to-do list, the keyboard gets dismissed as soon as the network activity indicator (indicating a sync with iCloud, i guess) disappears. That is extremely annoying when you want to enter many items in a row because you always get disrupted in typing when the app finishes syncing. (and autocorrect doing its rest to change that what you just entered to the next suggestion)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a list in the reminders app.\r\n2. Enter a new item\r\n3. Hit \"Return\" on the keyboard to proceed o entering the next item\r\n4. Wait a few seconds until the network activity indicator appears in the status bar\r\n5. Start typing the next item\r\n6. Get disrupted by the disappearing keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSync should have no impact on your ability to proceed typing. (So it shouldn't hide your keyboard unexpectedly!)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs soon as network activity indicator disappears, the keyboard hides as well and you need to tap on the new item you where typing in to proceed)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 (13A4280e), but experienced since iOS 8.?\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHave not met anyone else with this problem yet. O.o\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 (Germany), 64 GB"
