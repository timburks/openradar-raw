    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m implementing Handoff in my iOS app, and even though I’m providing a NSUserActivityTypes array in my Info.plist, my app crashes when I attempt to create a new activity via [[NSUserActivity alloc] init].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add NSUserActivityTypes array to Info.plist, with one item in contents.\r\n2. Attempt to create an NSUserActivity object via [[NSUserActivity alloc] init].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAn NSUserActivity instance will be allocated and can be used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app crashes and I receive the following exception:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'Caller did not provide an activityType, and this process does not have a NSUserActivityTypes in its Info.plist.'\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 6.3.2 (6D2105)\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)"
