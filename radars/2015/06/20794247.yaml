    description: "Summary:\r\nData returned from the CMPedometer and CMPedometerData classes return a step count based only on steps from the M7 and M8 motion co-processors.  When an Apple Watch is connected these APIs should smartly pool step data contributed by the Apple Watch (as the Health app appears to).\r\n\r\nMany apps (Pedometer++, FitBit, Moves, etc) use the CMPedometer classes to track and report a user's step count, however CMPedometer is no longer providing a full and complete picture of all of the available data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair an Apple Watch to an iPhone.\r\n2. Record various steps by moving around with the Apple Watch but without the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe step count returned by CMPedometer is higher than before the new steps, as it smartly pools steps recorded by the Apple Watch into the returned total.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe step count returned by CMPedometer remains unchanged, as the iPhone was not on the user's person to record the steps.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 [12F70], Watch OS 1.0 [12S507]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, Apple Watch"
