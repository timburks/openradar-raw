        In larger organizations, manually updating provisioning profiles, adding new App IDs, etc. is very painful and unnecessarily time-consuming. Even in small shops, developers would benefit from better automation tools.

        Now, the community can make automation tools and scripts just fine, but what would greatly simplify the process and make those tools more reliable is an officially sanctioned API for Apple Developer Portal — for managing certificates, provisioning profiles, app ids, etc…

        I believe that such an API already exists, for Xcode, so all it really takes is make it official, and provide some basic functionality.
