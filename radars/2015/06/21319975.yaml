    description: "Summary:\r\nWe use LDAP user accounts and home folders mounted via NFSv3 in our classroom. It works mostly ok but cfprefsd is unable to save Finder sidebar Favorites so when user logs out system does not save his changes to Finder sidebar favorites items.\r\n\r\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist in not created at all.\r\nThis is probably connected to cfprefs daemon responsible for saving those settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. bind Mac to LDAP directory server\r\n2. setup network home folders accessible by NFSv3 protocol (can be automounted)\r\n3. log in with some network user from LDAP directory\r\n4. edit Finder sidebar Favorites (add new folders, remove some default)\r\n5. log out\r\n6. log in with same user\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFinder sidebar Favorites changes are saved and I can see them at next login.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder sidebar Favorites return to default set of icons\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5\r\nOS X 10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee post by Trent Anderson\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/macenterprise/QTRSA-VfvOQ\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments"
