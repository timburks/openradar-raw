    description: "Summary:\r\nFor the most part, if you try to open Notification Center or Control Center when the status bar is visible, it opens immediately. The little tabs only appear in full screen apps. This expectation is broken in the video player. Perhaps this is because the controls can be hidden with a tap, but whatever the reason, the behavior is confusing. It's a constant source of frustration for me.\r\n\r\nI find the behavior especially odd since the video player never has any gestures that involve swiping up or down. Even when the video controls are hidden the current behavior isn't really necessary.\r\n\r\n(This is related to rdar://21429035 but that's more of a broad complaint and feature request. This is about one specific, inconsistent behavior that could even be considered a bug.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe problem itself can be reproduced in fewer stepsâ€”these steps and results also illustrate why it's so frustrating to me.\r\n\r\n1. Turn rotation lock on. (I usually keep rotation lock on because otherwise it almost always rotates to portrait if I set it on a table.)\r\n2. Open Safari or some other app and play a video.\r\n3. Rotate the device sideways. Since I don't always know if rotation is locked, it's easier to just turn it and find out.\r\n4. Use your thumb to swipe open Control Center from the right edge (since it's locked in portrait, that's the \"bottom\" still)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the status bar is showing, Control Center should open immediately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe little tab or handle appears, even if the status bar is showing. Often I have to swipe at this two or three times to get it to open, I find it's a bit trickier to do from this direction. Eventually it appears and I can unlock rotation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 (13A4254v) and earlier\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
