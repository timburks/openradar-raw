    description: "Summary:\r\nThis issue is related to rdar://21336540.\r\nUsing the same scenario, you can end up without a statusbar in Tweetbot *and* an even more problematic compose view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Hold phone in portrait mode\r\n2. Open tweetbot so that is show you the main timeline.\r\n3. Rotate phone to landscape mode\r\n4. hit reply on any tweet in the timeline.\r\n5. The compose screen appears, in portrait, with a too wide keyboard (see rdar://21336540). Observe the missing statusbar from on the navigation bar.\r\n6. Hit close.\r\n7.  You return to the timeline, with a reduced height navigation bar and no status bar (see: http://c.inferis.org/image/0G1h0F2g453M/IMG_0043.jpg)\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n8. make sure the phone did not rotate back to portrait, still keep it in landscape \r\n9. hit reply on a tweet again\r\n10. compose view comes up, this time with the UI in landscape mode but the keyboard too wide and on the right of the screen: (see: http://c.inferis.org/image/080L0C0l260v/IMG_0042.jpg)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. There should be a statusbar visible (as in the original state) and the navigation bar should have a standard height.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe statusbar should not disappear, nor should the navigationbar be reduced in height.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem does not go away by going outside the app and back in.\r\nYou can revert to a correct visual state by hitting close (after step 10). The main timeline will still be portrait but the statusbar is back and the navigation bar is standard height again.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is UIKit's problem or Tweetbot's problem but since it's easy to reproduce it might be a rotation API issue. I've encountered similar issues before when developing apps, so I feel there's a problem in different rotation settings for view controllers and switching between them."
