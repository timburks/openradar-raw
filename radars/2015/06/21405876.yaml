        Summary:
        10.11 introduced a “wiggle cursor to have it balloon in size” feature, which is awesome, but it activates too aggressively for my taste.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Move cursor using mouse normally. Cursor balloons.

        Expected Results:
        I should be able to increase the delay of the cursor size increasing.

        Actual Results:
        That delay is way too short for my taste, and not customizable.
