        Summary:
        SFSafariViewController has no delegate method to return the URL of the last page a user was looking at. It’d be beneficial to know this.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        N/A

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:

        I probably understand why this isn’t possible (privacy!), but here’s my use case anyway.

        I have a piece of UI in my application that allows the user to insert a link in their post. If it’s not on the clipboard, I’d like to show them a Safari View, let them pick out the page they’re looking for, and then return the URL to me.
