    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 7 issues a compiler warning if a subclass with a custom designated initializer (specified using NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER) does not implement the superclass designated initializer, even if the superclass designated initializer is marked unavailable (NS_UNAVAILABLE). This behaviour has changed between Xcode 6.x and Xcode 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached sample project illustrates the issue. In summary;\r\n\r\n1) Subclass NSObject\r\n2) Create custom designated initializer on subclass, mark is NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER\r\n3) Mark inherited init method unavailable using NS_UNAVAILABLE\r\n4) Warning issued; \"Method override for the designated initializer of the superclass '-init' not found\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warning is issued if the subclass designated initializer is marked unavailable (NS_UNAVAILABLE)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWarning is issued"
