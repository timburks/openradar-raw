    description: "When opening a pass on the mac (via Mail, Safari, Finder…), the preview window looks very different from the actual look of the pass on iOS. There are also a number of blatant UI bugs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a passbook on a mac and synchronize it on an iPhone using passbook. \r\nSee attached file \"different-on-mac.pkpass\", but these issues can be seen with pretty much any pass.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pass on the mac and on the iPhone should look identical.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mac preview looks very different from the iOS look. Specifically, on the provided example pass:\r\n\r\n* Additional shadows, around the pass and around the logo,\r\n* Additional outlines, below the header and around the barcode,\r\n* The header logoText collides with the header fields, only on the mac,\r\n* Different order of the headerFields (“TGV 8979”, “DATE 23 juin”),\r\n* Different text alignment of the headerFields. The mac preview doesn’t respect PKTextAlignmentLeft here,\r\n* Truncated multi-line primaryField on the mac,\r\n* All the auxiliaryFields are absent from the mac preview,\r\n* The footer.png image is displayed on the mac, while it’s ignored on iOS for this pass type,\r\n* Everywhere, but especially on the backFields labels, the font is different.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A178w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis isn’t particularly new; I don’t thing the mac Passbook viewer has been redesigned after iOS 7 changed everything on iOS."
