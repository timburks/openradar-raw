    description: "Summary:\r\nI just ran into a situation where iOS' BTLEServer was repeatedly crashing (~13 times in a row).\r\nThe LE connection itself survived these crashes, so from our accessory's side, we're just seeing a lot of service changed indications repeatedly.\r\nAfter a while, BTLEServer stopped crashing and recovered by itself.\r\n\r\nI attached BT diagnostics logs, the BTLEServer crashes and our accessory's firmware logs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 model MD655LL/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS8.3-BTLEServer-crash-loop.zip' was successfully uploaded."
