        Summary:
        When the Swift 2 syntax converter updates a call to a method that used to return NSError, the resulting code contains “catch var error as NSError”, which then yields a warning if the value isn’t mutated (and it typically won’t be). The migrator should update the code to “catch let error as NSError”
