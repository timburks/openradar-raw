        Summary:
        iOS 9 Multitasking should be supported at least on all currently shipping iPad AND iPad Mini.

        Notes:
        As mentioned in the keynote only the iPad Air 2 will support Multitasking. From a developers perspective it is an artificial limitation, we see impressive results from games and productivity APPs on devices with A7 CPU as well. Only supporting the latest iPad Air 2 is a very narrow target audience. This is a pity especially considering the special notes about system optimization compared to iOS 8 last year.
