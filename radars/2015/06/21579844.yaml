        Summary:
        Right now, I have 3 Xcode versions installed. Xcode 6.3 for production stuff, 6.4 beta and 7 beta for testing.

        However, I have multiple projects, each requiring a different version of the command line tools. Switching between the projects means also switching the command line tools with xcode-select -s <path>. Which is very easy to forget and result in errors.

        It would be nice if we could specify a different version of the tools per project (= directory). Many other command line based toolchains have something similar, e.g rvm or rbenv for Ruby[1]

        This would make it much easier to keep the production projects at the stable tool chains while experimenting with betas of upcoming versions.
