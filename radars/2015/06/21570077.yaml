        Summary:
        Markdown is a popular format for documentation, and read me files. It would be incredibly useful to have a markdown preview assistant editor in Xcode so when you are editing Markdown, can preview the results in the assistant editor.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Edit a Markdown file in the primary editor
        Try to preview the markdown in the assistant editor

        Expected Results:
        Expect a preview of the rendered markdown in the assistant editor

        Actual Results:
        No support for markdown preview.

        Regression:
        N/A
