        Summary:
        We would like to be able to use a single view controller instance from a Storyboard to instantiate subclasses of that view controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        N/A

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:

        The example is we have TEDVideoPlayerViewController which is a UIViewController subclass for playing our video content. We also have a subclass called TEDLocalHLSVideoPlayerViewController which is a subclass of TEDVideoPlayerViewController and adds more app-specific things that we use in the main TED app. We keep the parent TEDVideoPlayerViewController as much of a cleanroom AVFoundation-based player as possible.

        We canâ€™t migrate to Storyboards without duplicating the same storyboard to instantiate TEDLocalHLSVideoPlayerViewController as presently designed.
