    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm seeing an assertion failure in the iPhone Captive Network WebSheet when a Wi-Fi network is set up with an automatic Proxy PAC URL.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the logs show (line #12 in attached iPhone console log):\r\niPhone WebSheet[426] <Error>: assertion failed: 12F70: libxpc.dylib + 71768 [B870B51D-AA85-3686-A7D9-ACD48C5FE153]: 0x7d\r\n\r\nThe result is that the web sheet doesn't even make a request to the identified captive network redirect page (we can see this from the server side) and shows a blank screen to the user, followed eventually by an alert saying \"Error Opening Page / Hotspot login could not open the page because the server stopped responding.\"\r\n\r\nWe also see no request to the Proxy PAC URL during this process (see attached apache web logs).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a captive network with a Proxy PAC URL accessible within the walled garden\r\n2. Find the SSID in the iPhone's Wi-Fi network list and press the (i) to get the Wi-Fi settings\r\n3. Select Auto from the HTTP Proxy section and input the Proxy PAC URL\r\n4. Attempt to Join the network\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Captive Network web sheet should appear and display the captive network's login page. Also the iPhone should call the Proxy PAC URL.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Captive Network web sheet appears but is blank and times out after 1 minute with the following alert: \"Error Opening Page / Hotspot login could not open the page because the server stopped responding.\"\r\n\r\nAlso the Proxy PAC URL is not called\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64Gb using WiFi"
