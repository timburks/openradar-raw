        Summary:
        Standard Objective-C assertions have nullability warnings. This is probably just an oversight of the first beta.

        This can be fixed by updating the macro:

        	    [[NSAssertionHandler currentHandler] handleFailureInFunction:__assert_fn__ \
        		file:[NSString stringWithUTF8String:__FILE__] \

        stringWithUTF8String is now annotated to return a nullable string; while NSAssertionHandler’s file: wants a nonnull object. In that case a cast is probably an acceptable fix.

        Can be easily reproduced by adding NSC[Parameter]Assert’s to a function.
