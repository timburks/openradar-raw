        Summary:
        The first beta appears to be missing a significant portion of documentation. WKWebView (and corresponding classes) as well as UIUserNotificationAction make no mention of the new API introduced in iOS 9.

        Missing documentation found so far:
        UIUserNotificationAction
        WKWebView (and corresponding classes)
