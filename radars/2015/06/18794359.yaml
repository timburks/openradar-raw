    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using Handoff between an iOSâ€¯8 device and Yosemite, an iOS app may hand off to a website on mac, instead of a mac app. In this case, the Handoff icon in the Dock should display a specific icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse an iOS app implementing Handoff with a website.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icon in the mac Dock should describe what is the current active app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe generic Safari Handoff icon is displayed in the dock, as if the user were browsing the web on their iOS device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS8.1 device, Mac with Yosemite.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
