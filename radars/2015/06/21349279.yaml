        Summary:

        Xcode 4.3.3 for Lion cannot be installed.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Download Xcode 4.3.3 from the developer site:

        http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_4.3.3_for_lion/xcode_4.3.3_for_lion.dmg

        2) Install Xcode in /Applications
        3) Launch Xcode

        Expected Results:

        Xcode should run.

        Actual Results:

        Xcode can’t install additional components (the Mobile Device Framework). The following is logged in the console:

        6/11/15 4:06:36.799 PM authorizationhost: SFBuiltinEntitled: Xcode.app is not entitled for system.install.apple-software
        6/11/15 4:06:40.405 PM authorizationhost: SFBuiltinEntitled: Xcode.app is not entitled for system.install.apple-software
        6/11/15 4:06:40.425 PM authorizationhost: SFBuiltinEntitled: Xcode.app is not entitled for system.install.app-store-software
        6/11/15 4:06:40.444 PM authorizationhost: SFBuiltinEntitled: Xcode.app is not entitled for system.install.app-store-software
        6/11/15 4:06:40.446 PM com.apple.SecurityServer: Failed to authorize right 'system.install.app-store-software' by client '/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/installd' [369] for authorization created by '/Applications/Xcode.app' [346]

        Regression:

        This is an external change. The same VM and disk image used to work fine.

        Notes:

        There is no other way to build older projects (for older versions of Mac OS X). The newer tools don’t have the older SDKs.
