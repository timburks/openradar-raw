    description: "Currently, whenever a user posts a review of an application, there is no easy way for the developer to contact him back, except by scouting the web for his contact info, which is cumbersome and could be seen as intrusive.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of legitimate reasons for a developer to respond to user reviews; this is even the basic job of the support team. For example, when a user posts a review to report a bug, the developer can provide a workaround. When the user asks for a feature, the developer can contact him to ask for details, and when the feature gets implemented. \r\n\r\nIdeally, this would be a feature of the App Store and iTunes Connect. There is of course no need for the developer to get the personal email of the user: from the user point of view, it should only happen in the App Store. Developer replies could be either private or public ; Iâ€™d rather have them private, because it allows for a more personal answer from the support team.\r\n\r\n(When it comes to fake / hateful / inappropriate user reviews, iTunes Connect already provides a way for developers to ask for deletion at this address: https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=contactUs&contactfaq=customerreviewremovalrequest .This could be a bit easier, too, but at least it exists.)"
