    description: "Summary:\r\nAmid hundreds of amazing changes and additions to the stdlib, this change felt rather gratuitous. Rather than having 'print' and 'println' functions, whose conventions are well established, we now have a 'print' function that does the job of the old 'println', and takes a verbose optional parameter in order to emulate the behavior of the old 'print'. And we now have bugs like 18309853, in which trying to print a line to the console in an NSView subclass does something completely unexpected.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider whether or not this change is a net positive or not for developer ergonomics.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.0, all betas"
