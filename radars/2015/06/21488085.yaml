        Summary:
        DEP OS X devices should have an option to bind to a Directory Service (AD) and skip local account creation.

        Ideally the workflow would be as follows:
        Option to VPN in during MDM Setup Assistant if device is not within authenticated network.
        Bind to Directory Services
        Create new HSA (hidden service account)
        Allow user to login with network credentials

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Setup DEP / Profile Manager
        Enroll OS X El Capitan device

        Expected Results:
        MDM Setup Assistant should bind to AD.

        Actual Results:
        No current option.
