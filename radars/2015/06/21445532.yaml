    description: "Summary:\r\nI have been seeing an issue where iOS 9 beta 1 was having trouble pairing with another Bluetooth LE device.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw on an air trace:\r\n1. LE Pairing procedure started (iPhone as master, accessory as slave)\r\n2. Pairing Random is exchanged in both directions\r\n3. LL_ENC_REQ does not get sent by the BT controller of the iPhone, so link does not get encrypted\r\n4. Pairing procedure fails due to timeout\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm not sure how to reproduce it.\r\nI've hit this a couple times in a row.\r\nAfter rebooting the iPhone, the problem went away.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe master (iPhone) should send LL_ENC_REQ to start encrypting the link, so that the Pairing procedure can continue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLL_ENC_REQ does not get sent by the BT controller of the iPhone, so link does not get encrypted and the Pairing procedure fails.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 1 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 (A1429)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
