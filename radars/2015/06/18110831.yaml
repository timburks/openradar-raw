    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the new WKWebView class, if it is presented in a modal fashion, any long pressed links will not show the action sheet for choosing options as to how to handle the link. Instead, a message like the following is generated, \"Warning: Attempt to present <WKActionSheet: 0x7fcd60572d10> on <ViewController: 0x7fcd60522c10> whose view is not in the window hierarchy!\"\r\n\r\nOn iPad, if this happens and then a user rotates, the modal view is abruptly dismissed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Run the attached application.\r\n1. Press the \"Show Web View\" button, and wait for the page to load\r\n2. Long press on any element\r\n(3.) if on iPad, rotate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe action sheet with options for link handling is correctly displayed. And if the device is an iPad, it rotates correctly without dismissing the content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo action sheet is presented on iPhone or iPad, however, the following message is generated, \"Warning: Attempt to present <WKActionSheet: 0x7fcd60572d10> on <ViewController: 0x7fcd60522c10> whose view is not in the window hierarchy!\". If the user is on an iPad and has rotated, the entire modal view controller is removed from the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 64GB AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'webkittest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
