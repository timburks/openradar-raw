    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you present an open panel as a standalone window instead of as a sheet, then switching between split views obscures the open panel partially or completely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached Bug Repro project.\r\n2. Put the Bug Repro app in a full screen split view alongside a second app.\r\n3. Click the \"Show Open Panel\" button. A stand-alone open panel appears.\r\n4. Click on the other app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the open panel to either A. not become obscured at all or B. become un-obscured if I click back on the Bug Repro app's main window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe open panel becomes partially or completely obscured. If partially obscured, you can click on it to bring it back to the foreground. If completely obscured, you cannot get it back, even if you click back on the Bug Repro app's main window.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A178w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Mac\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Bug Repro.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 1.30.37 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
