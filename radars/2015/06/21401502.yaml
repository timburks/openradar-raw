    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen UICollectionView is inserting several items at once, it sometimes does not invoke the UICollectionViewDataSource method to update the supplementary views (-collectionView:viewForSupplementaryElementOfKind:atIndexPath:) but instead continues to display them on-screen.\r\n\r\nThis is a complicated problem to explain, so I've attached a sample project as well to demonstrate. In the sample project, you'll find that I have a custom layout like:\r\n\r\n(Supplementary) (Cell) (Supplementary)\r\n\r\nAll 3 are updated to the same text/background color value, so you can quickly visually inspect for errors. You'll note an error in the sample project is that the cell will be updated to a correct value, but not its supplementary views (see attached: example_error.png; the \"ZZZZ\" row's supplementary views are not correct).\r\n\r\nThis happens in iOS 8.3 and iOS 9.0. In iOS 8, the sample project does *not* alert, because grabbing supplementary views is harder, but since iOS 9 added a method for it, this sample project is a lot easier to demonstrate there.\r\n\r\nNote: this alert might happen even if nothing is visually wrong because the views are coincidentally representing the right type. Hit start again and it'll happen quickly.\r\n\r\nPress the \"play\" bar button item in the sample project to begin.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a UICollectionViewLayout subclass which uses supplementary views per index path.\r\n2. Insert multiple items at once into the collection view.\r\n3. Note the supplementary views do not update properly sometimes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe supplementary views always have the UICollectionViewDataSource method invoked when they are being placed on-screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe supplementary views are reused without invoking the UICollectionViewDataSource method.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 beta (7A120f), Xcode 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a complicated sample project, so if you have any questions, please let me know. It was a bit difficult to distill my main project into this sample project, but I have been battling this issue since before iOS 8.3 came out. My workarounds (never inserting index paths less-than the current maximum item) don't let me use UICollectionView to its full potential.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS simulator, iPhone 6, iPod Touch\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CollectionViewSupplementaryViewReuse.zip' and 'example_error.png' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments available at https://bitbucket.org/zacwest/collectionviewsupplementaryviewreuse"
