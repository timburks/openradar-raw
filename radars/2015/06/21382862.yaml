    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an app hasn’t been updated since the iOS 6 SDK - the “Back to…” status bar button looks like …. a button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app linked against iOS 6, in iOS 9. (Purchase Sayonara if you don’t have one handy https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sayonara-for-twitter/id563997353?mt=8)\r\n2. Open Twitter, and say something terrible so that someone unfollows you\r\n3. Wait for the Sayonara push notification\r\n4. Tap the push notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe “Back to Twitter” status bar button should look at least _similar_ to iOS 9\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe “Back to Twitter” status bar looks like an iOS 6 button, which while quite nostalgic, looks rather out of place - and also overlaps the app’s status bar."
