    description: "Whenever I go to https://bugreport.apple.com and submit a bug report it usually takes at least 3 minutes between clicking submit and getting the Radar Number, that, without submitting any big file.\r\n\r\nI've had this problem for years on my account, on any of my various macs. I tried this from an iMac in Dev Tools Lab B at WWDC. It surely has to do with my account."
