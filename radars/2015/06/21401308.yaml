    description: "Summary:\r\nSince Mavericks, Mail.app has become incapable of managing IMAP subscriptions. Instead of allowing users to pick which shared mailboxes they’d like to see as was the case in Mountain Lion, all messages from all subscribable mailboxes are downloaded to the user’s device. \r\n\r\nThis new behavior, combined with the fact that it is no longer possible to disable message caching, makes it impossible for some organizations to use Apple Mail in newer versions of OS X as the amount of messages exceeds the storage capacity of most Macs. \r\n\r\nPlease restore the subscription functionality as it was found in Mail on Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Mail.app, setup access to an IMAP server that provides subscribable mailboxes\r\n\r\n2. In the sidebar, select one of the mailboxes that are stored on the IMAP server\r\n\r\n3. Click the gear button at the bottom of the sidebar and select the Get Account Info command\r\n\r\n4. Click the Subscription List tab\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs in Mail on OS X Mountain Lion, a list of subscribable mailboxes appears, allowing the user to pick which ones to see in the sidebar and load messages from.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe list is empty. It is impossible to manage subscriptions. All subscribable mailboxes, which should be invisible by default, are visible and the contents are cached on the Mac.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://forums.kerio.com/t/25890/mavericks-mail-app-and-public-email-folders"
