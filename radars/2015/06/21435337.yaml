        Summary:
        Sometimes, I write buggy code. I know, I know. It’s a shock to me too. But when I do, it would be amazing if I could debug _inside of my playground_. That way, for instance, I could figure out why my program doesn’t halt. Or why an orange isn’t a banana. A whole horizon of possibilities would open up!
