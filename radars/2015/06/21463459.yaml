    description: When using the NSLocalizedString macro in Swift or ObjC code, there is a required parameter which is a note to the translator to provide context for translating the string.  However, when exporting xliff files from Xcode, the strings that are in storyboards and xib files have no notes to the translator.  There needs to be a place in Xcode where we can add these notes and they need to be exported/imported to and from the xliff file.
