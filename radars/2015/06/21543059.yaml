        Summary:

        On iOS 9b2 go to Settings -> Safari -> Passwords

        The “Enter passcode” view controller appears, but it’s full-screen modal and the keyboard, while “displayed,” is shown white-on-white. (Tap bottom right to dismiss. Tapping the “keys” does result in letters being added to the password text field.)

        I’m running this on an iPad 3.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        On iOS 9b2 go to Settings -> Safari -> Passwords

        Expected Results:

        The keyboard should be visible. Probably not modal either.

        Actual Results:

        See attached screenshot and summary.

        Regression:

        I didn’t try this on beta 1. It’s certainly not present on iOS 8.x.

        Notes:

        On the plus side it’s very secure.
