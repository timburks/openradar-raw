    description: "Summary:\nReflection on enums should provide information about each case. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSee the attached playground.\n\nExpected Results:\nBe able to get a Mirror of the enum type and iterate over the cases to get information of the meta type. \n\nActual Results:\nmirror.count returns 0, so there is no way to get information about the cases. \n\nRegression:\n\n\nNotes:\nEnums are really powerful in Swift, but there are a couple of things missing. For example an .all method to get a Sequence with the cases or something similar. If the language itself doesnâ€™t want to support that at least would be nice to have enough reflection powers to do it ourselves."
