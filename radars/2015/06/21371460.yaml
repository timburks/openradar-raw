    description: "Summary:\r\nThe app switcher does not remain open long enough to use it, when opening it from inside select applications. This makes it impossible to use, and I've had to quit the app, and use the App switcher from the homescreen on numerous occasions. This has happened to me inside of Tweetbot and numerous other applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unlock iPhone\r\n2. Open an application\r\n3. Double-click home button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp Switcher would remain open until closed, or an application is selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp Switcher closes itself immediately after being opened.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDuplicate of rdar://21370878\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch 5th generation 64GB"
