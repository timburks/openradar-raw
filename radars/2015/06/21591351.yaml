    description: "Summary:\r\nSince calling invalidate on a NSTimer object in dealloc is almost always a mistake, the Objective-C compiler should output a warning anytime invalidate is called from dealloc.\r\n\r\nRationale: while the NSTimer is valid, the NSTimer object holds a strong reference to the target object. Since the ref count is not zero, dealloc will never be called and therefore, invalidate will never be called either.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an object that creates a NSTimer and assigns itself as the target.\r\n2. Call invalidate in the dealloc method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompiler outputs a warning that invalidate will never be called since a strong reference is held by the NSTimer object.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo compiler warning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
