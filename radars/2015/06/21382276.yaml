    description: "Lewis Dorigo15-Jun-2015 03:57 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMany websites behave more like apps in the way that users use them. iOS provides the functionality to save these websites to the home screen, using `apple-touch-icon` meta tag as the “app” icon. A saved web app can behave differently, including hiding the regular browser UI.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer on Windows provides a similar functionality, allowing apps to be pinned to the Task Bar and Start Screens, using a custom icon, and UI colors.\r\n\r\nThis feature is conspicuously missing from Safari on OS X. Users can save URLs to the dock, but this does not use the `apple-touch-icon`, nor does it make any difference to the browser’s UI.\r\n\r\nThere is commercial software to accomplish thins — Fluid, for example — but this seems like functionality that should be built into the browser an OS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a website.\r\n2. Drag the URL into the dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• You should be able to drag the URL into the apps section of the dock.\r\n• The app should use the same `apple-touch-icon` meta tag to generate an app icon as iOS, and should be clipped to the same shape as iOS icons.\r\n• If specified in the `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag, the site should open in it’s own window, and default browser UI should not be shown. Internal links should open in the app, but links to external sites should open in a new Safari window.\r\n• If `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` is not specified, it should open in Safari, with the regular browser UI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• You can only drag the URL into the folders section of the dock.\r\n• All websites use the same globe icon.\r\n• Clicking the icon always opens the site in Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0.6 (10600.6.3)\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.3 (14D136)"
