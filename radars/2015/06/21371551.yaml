    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new photos app on OS X is great, and using it with iCloud Photo Library to keep photos, and albums synced is just seamless. With one exception. That is, the baffling lack of sync of Faces between Macs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Spend time adding Faces data to photos on one Mac.\r\n2. Launch photos on another Mac, and wait for the library to sync.\r\n3. Go to Albums View.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee all the Faces that you just added on the other Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no faces, or there is a completely different set of Faces.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.30 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYes, dealing with conflicts on Faces would be kinda difficult — especially with those of us who now have two or more faces databases on our different Macs — but this seems like a basic feature that it should have.\r\n\r\nAlso: why do Faces show in Photos for iOS?"
