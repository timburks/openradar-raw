    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen typing very quickly with two fingers, it's common to inadvertently select and replace existing text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use two fingers to type into a note or message\r\n2. Type (very) quickly\r\n3. Ensure that you tap two keys in rapid succession, with separate fingers.\r\n4. If key 1 isn't released before key 2 is pressed, the word is selected\r\n5. Because I'm typing, I end up replacing whatever text was just selected\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be much harder to accidentally destroy previously typed text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy typed text is destroyed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 Beta1"
