        Summary:
        I was trying to select only photos I wanted to keep from a burst and couldn’t understand why it would keep my selection (on both iPhone and Mac) in the app, but not get rid of the burst from the bursts album.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Take a burst photo
        2. On the iPhone, select one image from the burst to keep/export but also choose “keep everything”
        3. On the Mac, select a few more images from the same burst in the bursts album
        4. Click done

        Expected Results:
        A prompt would appear asking if I wanted to keep everything or just the selected items. Then I would be able to click “just the selected ones” and it would remove the burst from my bursts albums.

        Actual Results:
        No prompt. No information or indication. It just navigates back into the meta-album, saving selection choices.

        Regression:
        None.

        Notes:
        It turns out the only way to work around this is to deselect everything from the burst, select “Done”, and begin the process from scratch. My guess is that once a burst is set to “keep everything”, it retains this invisible status until all selections are once again removed. My suggestion is that this process/flow/ux needs improvement to avoid confusion.
