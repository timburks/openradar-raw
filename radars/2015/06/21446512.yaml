    description: "Summary:\r\nAn Xcode Bot is used for continuous integration on a project. If that projectâ€™s repository has a git submodule pointing to a commit that isn't available on a remote repository that is available, the integration correctly fails. It even correctly indicates that it could not check out the expected code from a remote repository. However it does not provide enough details about the problem to easily solve it. The failed integration does not provide logs, and the Xcode server logs are not any more useful than the high-level idea that a source control checkout failed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an Xcode project in a git repository with a git submodule.\r\nConfigure a bot for the repository.\r\nSee that everything integrates correctly\r\nMake a commit in the git submodule, commit the change to submodules in the main repository but to not push the submodule commit.\r\nTry to integrate with Xcode Bot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally the Integration results should indicate that a git submodule is not available at the required commit. Short of that, the bot should show logs that may help show where the source control failure occurred. Short of that, the server logs could indicate which sub-operation within the checkout failed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe integration shows that it failed due to being unable to check out the project. There are no logs for the integration. The Xcode server logs provide no additionally useful information. Only that a failed check out was indeed the reason for failure."
