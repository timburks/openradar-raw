    description: "When a \"relevantDate\" is specified for a passbook pass, it’s made visible for some time before and after that date. (a few hours, as far as I know.) The exact amount of time should be specified in the documentation, especially if it’s different for each pass type.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook up the documentation for the \"relevantDate\" in passbook.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind how Passbook decides when to display the pass on the lock screen and how the relevantDate and the pass type are taken into account.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo info \U0001F615. Try with different types and infer the behavior from these experiments."
