    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift doc comments on methods have an inconsistent styling and they don't seem to support all the previous key terms such as `discussion` and `abstract`.\r\n\r\nFor example, for what was `:return:` it is `- returns: ` but for what was `:param:` it is now `- parameter ` without the `:`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode 6 and create a Swift 1.2 project/file\r\n2. write a method\r\n3. Document said method with key terms for parameters, warnings, return type, etc\r\n4. Open Xcode 7 and migrate the project to Swift 2.0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect formatting to be consistent between the key word types & that the migrator would migrate all previous key words correctly & all previous keywords would be supported\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`discussion`, `abstract` `warning`, `note` will not migrate. Formatting style between key words is not 100% the same for all & not all previous key words are supported\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7 & Swift 2.0 project"
