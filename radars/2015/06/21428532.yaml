    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen editing a single view XIB with autolayout enabled and the live autoresize feature turned on in Editor->Canvas->Live Autoresizing resizing the top-level view doesn’t cause its subviews to automatically resize/relayout. This makes it more difficult to understand how the constraints are behaving.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a single view XIB. Set the file’s owner to NSViewController (or a subclass thereof).\r\n2. Make sure Auto Layout is enabled in the File Inspector\r\n3. Add some subviews and constraints\r\n4. Make sure Live Autoresizing is turned on in Editor->Canvas->Live Autoresizing.\r\n5. Resize the top-level view by dragging the corner.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe subviews’ layout updates in realtime based on the constraints that have been set up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe subviews size and position remains the same exactly as if Live Autoresizing were disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.2 (6D2102)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA video of this behavior can be seen here: http://recordit.co/SGDTgZ71Md\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI seem to recall this working in older versions of Xcode but I didn’t use Auto Layout much until Xcode 6.x so my memory could be faulty."
