        Summary:
        Creating a new complete AppleID profile including credit card information for every client is cumbersome. Allowing an iTunes Connect user to belong to more than one team/organisation would be much simpler.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Log into iTunes Connect
        2. Add a new user
        3. Get the error message that her/his AppleID is already associated with an iTunes Connect account.

        Expected Results:
        The user is added to the account, no matter what.

        Actual Results:
        The user is not added to the account. The user has to create a new AppleID including credit card information.
