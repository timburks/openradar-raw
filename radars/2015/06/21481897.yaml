    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://20615507\n\nSummary:\r\nIf you attempt to show a UIAlertView on iOS 8.3, and already have the keyboard open (e.g., a UITextField is first responder), and the alertViewStyle = UIAlertViewStylePlainTextInput, then the app will crash with a NSInternalInconsistencyException\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create UITextField and becomeFirstResponder\r\n2. Create UIAlertView\r\n3. Set alertViewStyle = UIAlertViewStylePlainTextInput\r\n4. Show alert view (on iOS 8.3)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt displays\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt crashes:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'The layout constraints still need update after sending -updateConstraints to <_UIKeyboardLayoutAlignmentView: 0x10030ed40; frame = (0 0; 0 0); userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = <CALayer: 0x17402c3e0>>.\r\n_UIKeyboardLayoutAlignmentView or one of its superclasses may have overridden -updateConstraints without calling super. Or, something may have dirtied layout constraints in the middle of updating them.  Both are programming errors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm aware that UIAlertView has been deprecated in iOS 8, but for backwards compatibility with iOS 7 it's still convenient to use it. UIAlertController does not have this bug, and I can also workaround it by resigning the first responder before showing the UIAlertView.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
