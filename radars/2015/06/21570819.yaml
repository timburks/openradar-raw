    description: "Before iOS 9 I use:\r\nABCreateStringWithAddressDictionary(CLPlacemark.addressDictionary, NO)\r\n\r\nBut in iOS 9 ABCreateStringWithAddressDictionary is deprecated. The Xcode warning tells me to use CNPostalAddressFormatter instead. However, CNPostalAddressFormatter can only format CNPostalAddress but there is no way to properly convert CLPlacemark to CNPostalAddress: only these 3 properties are shared by CLPlacemark and CNPostalAddress: country, ISOcountryCode, postalCode.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0I0l1q1H3U2R"
