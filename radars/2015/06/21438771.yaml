    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting an ABUnknownPersionViewController on a UINavigationController there are two visual glitches. This is a regression. Running on iOS 8 or built with the iOS 8 SDK these glitches don't occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Run the provided sample app on iOS 9 simulator.\r\n2) Click on the center button\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the presented view controller should appear, correctly laid out\r\n- just like in iOS 8\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- before any content of the presented view controller appears, there is a black background visible\r\n- after a short pause the content appears\r\n- but it goes behind the navigation bar because it does not obey the topLayoutGuide\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApparently you changed the internal implementation of ABUnknownPersionViewController to use a controller from the new Contacts framework. Your implementation seem to not take the use case into account which is shown by the sample app.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
