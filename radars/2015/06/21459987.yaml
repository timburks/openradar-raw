    description: "Summary:\r\nJust now, the placement of Hot Corners in system preferences is really stupid.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System Preferences\r\n2. Try and find Hot Corners\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user clicks “General”, and Hot Corners is an option there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user clicks “General”. Hot Corners isn’t there.\r\nThey click “Mouse”. No Hot Corners here, either.\r\nThey type “Hot Corners” in the search field, and two options highlight.\r\nThey click the first — Desktop and Screen Saver.\r\nHot Corners isn’t immediately visible — it’s bafflingly hidden under the Screen Saver tab.\r\nThey click back and open Mission Control, where Hot Corners is an easily missable button in the bottom left corner.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSurely it should be under “General”? It’s not really related to Mission Control, and it really has no place being in the Screen Saver options…"
