        Summary:
        When an inline link is long-pressed in Safari, an action sheet with only a few built-in options is displayed. It would be much better if a UIActivityViewController was presented instead; this would allow all of the share and action extensions that the user has enabled to act on the URL being interacted with.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Long-press an inline link in Safari.

        Expected Results:
        A UIActivityViewController should be displayed with system actions as well as any action and share extensions that the user has enabled.

        Actual Results:
        An action sheet with only a few select built-in options is displayed.

        Regression:
        N/A
