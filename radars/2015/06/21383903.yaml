    description: |-
        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/
        2. Command-click a bunch of sessions to open them in separate tabs for later viewing
        3. Try to find one of the sessions you picked by name

        Expected Results:
        Each tab should be named with the title of the session picked.

        Actual Results:
        All tabs are named “WWDC 2015 - Videos - Apple Developer”, making it impossible to tell them apart without clicking (and starting to load the video for) each one.
