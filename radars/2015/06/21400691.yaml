    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working on say MPC projects one has to launch every connected device separately and toggle through debug consoles and what not in order to be run / test / debug / monitor running apps on multiple devices at the same time.  This is a pain and a huge time consuming task.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. launch Xcode\r\n2. attach multiple iPhones / iPads to your Mac\r\n3. run app on device A\r\n4. run app on device B\r\n5. run app on device C\r\n6. ...\r\n7. stop running app on each device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLaunch Xcode\r\nAttach multiple iOS devices\r\n\r\nTrigger a \"Run Schema Set\" action that builds and runs an app on multiple iOS devices at the same time.  Console logs are easy to follow at the same time, using an improved UI. Each entry in the \"Schema Set\" relates to a [schema:device] relationship.  3 devices use Schema A and 1 device uses Schema B.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. launch Xcode\r\n2. attach multiple iPhones / iPads to your Mac\r\n3. run app on device A\r\n4. run app on device B\r\n5. run app on device C\r\n6. ...\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have more input if you are open to feedback as I work with beacons and MPC a lot these days.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs whenever a developer needs to test an app on multiple real life devices concurrently. \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
