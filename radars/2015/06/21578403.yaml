    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using GKTurnBasedEventListener to handle game state changes. However, not all methods are called. The following method:\r\n\r\n- player: receivedTurnEventForMatch: didBecomeActive:\r\n\r\nis never called. I am testing it on devices. Even my current versions of live apps are affected by this(!).\r\n\r\nFor some reason the following method is working:\r\n- player: matchEnded:\r\n\r\nThis has been confirmed by Apple Developer Technical Support Team.\r\n\r\nI have created a sample Xcode project to make this easier to test for you.\r\nIt can be downloaded from dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mh91ecb37kwoawt/TurnBasedGame.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe listener is implemented in line 72 of ViewController.m. I have added a warning inside that method. The sample app is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sample app.\r\n2. Create a game.\r\n3. Open the app on another device.\r\n4. Join the game.\r\n5. Make a move on one device and wait for the notification on another one (it doesn't work!)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe following method is called:\r\n\r\n- player: receivedTurnEventForMatch: didBecomeActive:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe listener is never notified about game state changes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 [12F70], iOS 8.3 [12F69]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has been confirmed by Apple Developer Technical Support Team. Follow-up number was 624533121.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 MG4H2ZD/A - iOS 8.3 (12F70), iPad 2 MC983PL/A - iOS 8.3 (12F69)"
