        iOS 9 limits the ability to call canOpenURL by apps. This is good for privacy — most apps don’t need that and they shouldn’t care.

        However, there is a class of apps (power user, automation apps), where the ability to check if an app is installed and call them (without needing to specify a small subset of supported apps in compile time), drastically reduces their usefulness.

        Given that security/privacy implications of allowing canOpenURL are relatively benign, there should be a way for certain apps that really need this ability to ask for it.

        One way to do it is to use the “temporary exception” entitlements mechanism, just like on the Mac. An app that needs this feature would have to ask for it during review.
