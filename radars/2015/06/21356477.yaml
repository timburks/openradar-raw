    description: "Summary:\r\nThe drag-and-drop of books from the iBooks for Mac library, allowing backups of books to be taken to the filesystem, doesn't have a keyboard equivalent such as copy-paste, and the VO drag and drop commands built into VoiceOver all seem to be ineffective.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iBooks and ensure you have some content.\r\n\r\n2. Switch to list view and select some content (you could use Cmd+A to select all, or select just one row).\r\n\r\n3.  Now try to get those objects saved in their native formats from the keyboard alone.  Cmd+C to copy, for example.  VoiceOver drag-drop commands to mark and then drop when a Finder window for the target folder has focus. Mouse down / mouse up, in a similar way.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe same action as a physical drag-drop should occur, i.e. the files should appear in the target in their native formats.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu commands are all dimmed and don't help.  Apparently only the mouse works.  The VO commands always failed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround is to simply sudo rm -rf the iBooks app bundle, so iTunes goes back to doing book management in the media folder. The containerisation of iBooks and the loss of single files means that the backup function is critical for me, because otherwise non-Apple content would be destroyed if the boot drive failed. (There's a separate rant in here somewhere about WTF the app requires data be stored uncompressed in a container on the boot drive, instead of in the native format and in a user-supplied location, but that can probably wait.)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMBP Retina, 15-inch, mid 2014"
