    description: "When nothing is in my scene (GameScene.sks) file and change the color, the file isn't marked as \"has changed\" and clicking on another file (and coming back) discards the changes I made in this background. If I save, all goes well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n• Create a new standard SpriteKit Game for iOS with Swift 2.0 in Xcode 7 Beta 2\r\n• Open GameScene.sks\r\n• Change the background color\r\n• Go to another file (e.g. GameScene.swift)\r\n• Come back to GameScene.sks\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\n\r\nThe changed color should be still there. Also, the file should be marked as \"has changed/need to be saved\"\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\n\r\nThe changes are discarded and the file isn't marked as changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: As soon as I save the .sks file, all consequent changes will not be discarded. Changing the background color still doesn't mark the file as changed, however."
