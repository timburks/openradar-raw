    description: "Summary:\r\nSome websites use HTTP Basic Authentication as a way to protect the site content (as insecure as that is).\r\n\r\nKeychain on iOS, however, does not provide an interface to save HTTP Basic Auth credentials.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a site that uses HTTP Basic Authentication.\r\n2. Enter user name and password.\r\n3. Close the tab, and force-quit Safari.\r\n4. Navigate to the same site.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen entering the site for the first time, and entering credentials, the user should be asked if they want to save the password, meaning they do not have to enter the password when navigating the site the second time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user is not asked to save the password, meaning they must enter the password again on subsequent visits to the site.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI did not test whether a saved password, synced from a Mac using iCloud Keychain would work."
