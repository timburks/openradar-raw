    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS keyboard is not visually centered and aligned. The attached image shows the current keyboard in red and a mockup of a properly aligned keyboard on the right.\r\n\r\nThe reason being is probably because the letters weren't visually aligned but were simply labeled systematically like any other UILabel. This means that characters like \"1\" or \"j\" do not appear centered. 1 and j in particular are off to the right even though the majority of the weight is on the right.\r\n\r\nA solution is to use weight based positioning like the solution for iOS 7's calendar, where the centering of the letters were based on how many pixels there were and then evened out over the four quadrants so they would be visually centered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open phone\r\n2. Find any text field that shows the system keyboard\r\n3. Uncapitalize (release the shift button)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keys would be visually centered and pleasing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keys are centered based on bounds and are not visually centered.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 1\r\n\r\nLink to tweet:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/schemetrical/status/608459887232884736"
