    description: "Summary:\r\nThe only method to download additional iOS Simulators is from within Xcode.\r\nOn the Developer Portal Downloads page, no download package is provided. Graphics, IO, and command line tools do have separate packages. Simulators do not.\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to distribute a full developer environment in an enterprise, for example. As further downloads must be done from within a developer tool.\r\nThis is also hard on environments with bandwidth and download limits.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Login and go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee download packages for the iOS Simulators not included in the Xcode packages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee no download package for iOS Simulators."
