    description: "Summary:\r\nIf your estimated heights are incorrect and you call reloadData, the table view will jump around. If the estimated heights were too large, the table view will jump as you scroll up (each time a new cell comes on screen, the table view will jump). If the estimated heights were too small, the entire table view will jump when you call reloadData\r\n\r\nThe amounts that the table view jumps is related to the error between your estimated height and the actual height.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetup: iOS 8. Returning UITableViewAutomaticDimension for the cell height, and also using an estimated row height. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe table view won't jump around as you scroll.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt jump around as you scroll.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHappens in every iOS8 build I've seen\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone"
