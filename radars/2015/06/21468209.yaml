    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen editing a xib which uses autolayout, changing constraints doesn't update the views unless you do it manually. Xcode should support a mode where it automatically updates the view positions.\r\n\r\nI would like this change because as it is right now, I have to tweak a value, update the views, repeat, several times, when I could just modify the value until the constraint matches my intention.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a view using auto-layout.\r\n2. Attempt to apply constraints to suit needs.\r\n3. Find difficulty in understanding the impact of the constraints\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode shows me what the view would look like if I ran it in the simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode shows me views in whatever random place they were last in.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.2/6D2105\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/kbcathey/status/611665326623690752\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
