    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode supports type selection in the target device picker menu: if I pop it open, then press the number 6, only the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ Simulator entries remain. However, the list doesn't actually shorten, leaving lots of empty space around the filtered entry/entries.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an iOS project.\r\n2. Click on the device picker pop-up menu in the top left.\r\n3. Type the number 6.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe visible pop-up rect shortens to only include the two matching Simulator entries.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the two matching Simulator entries remain, but the pop-up rect remains as large as it was when first shown."
