    description: "Summary:\r\nNotifications from Reminders should also have the opportunity to be repeated; currently only notifications from Messages have this ability.  Text/iMessages are rarely important enough to me that I need the option to be alerted multiple times to their presence.  However, I use Reminders heavily to make sure I complete important tasks that I am not likely to remember on my own, and if I do not have my iPhone with me, or am prevented from using it, when a notification for a Reminder files, I am likely not to notice I have a missed/un-acted-upon Reminder until it's too late.  If there were an option in Notification Center to allow Reminder notifications to notify me repeatedly (like is currently available for Messages), though, I am much more likely to be able to act upon these missed notifications in time thanks to repeated alert sounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nScenario A (time-based Reminder):\r\nA1. Set a reminder to be notified at a certain time.\r\nA2. Leave your iPhone in another room when called away to help someone during the time at which a reminder is set to occur.\r\nA3. Do not remember that you had a reminder set (because you set the reminder to remind you!) and forget to check your iPhone when you return to it.\r\nA4. Fail to complete the task you wanted to be reminded about.\r\n\r\nScenario B (location-based Reminder):\r\nB1. Set a geo-fenced reminder to be notified when you arrive at home.\r\nB2. Reminder notification fires when turning onto your street, since geo-fenced reminders have a wide triggerable area.  Do not look at your iPhone while driving since it is illegal to do so.\r\nB3. Be greeted by someone upon arriving home and be distracted from looking at iPhone to see what the notification was.\r\nB4.  Fail to to complete the task you wanted to be reminded about.\r\nB5. A notification for the Reminder fires the next time I arrive turn onto my street; wonder what I was supposed to be reminded of.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScenario A: Notification Center's options for Reminders allows me to set Reminders notifications to repeat, so that I hear a subsequent notification alert sound upon returning to my iPhone.\r\n\r\nScenario B: Notification Center's options for Reminders allows me to set Reminders notifications to repeat, so that I hear a subsequent notification alert sound after I have entered my house and can immediately act upon the notification.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScenario A: Notification Center's options for Reminders does not contain an option for repeating alerts.  \r\n\r\nDo not remember that you had a reminder set (because you set the reminder to remind you!) and forget to check your iPhone when you return to it, thereby failing to complete the task you wanted to be reminded about.\r\n\r\nScenario B: Notification Center's options for Reminders does not contain an option for repeating alerts.\r\n\r\nBe greeted by someone upon arriving home and be distracted from looking at iPhone to see what the notification was, and fail to to complete the task you wanted to be reminded about. Also, a notification for the Reminder fires the next time I arrive turn onto my street, and I wonder what I was supposed to be reminded about.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBoth of the examples provided have happened to me within the past week.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 16GB, Verizon, using both Wi-Fi and Cellular"
