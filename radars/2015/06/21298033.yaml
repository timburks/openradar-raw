    description: "Xcode Version 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nTest Application Data bundles allow you to capture the persisted state of an application from a device.\r\nIn Xcode, schemes allow you to select Test Application Data to install with the app when you Run it. This is useful for testing, and most importantly - testing CoreData migrations.\r\n\r\nThis does not work in Xcode Version 7.0 beta (7A120f).\r\n\r\nThis feature has not worked correctly since Xcode Version 6.0.1 (6A317). Selecting a Test Application Data bundle to run in the simulator would always present an error message, despite the message saying it will work the \"next time you run your app\". A few versions later this message is not shown and the problem persists.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Version 7.0 beta (7A120f) (or greater than or equal to Version 6.0.1 (6A317)).\r\n2. Extract files and Xcode Project in attached 'ApplicationPackageTest' zip file.\r\n3. Run test.sh\r\n4. Open the xcode project and run tests on the various shared schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScheme 'With Container' passed tests. Simulator now contains data.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScheme 'With Container' fails tests. No data is copied to the simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ApplicationPackageTest.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nSample source code available here https://github.com/Ashton-W/rdar_ApplicationDataPackage"
