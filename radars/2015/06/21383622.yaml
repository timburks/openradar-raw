    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the iOS 9 SDK, the NSPersonNameComponents header file has a known cheater as it's example in the header file.  Specifically, Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees.\r\n\r\nThis is not a good example to use and should be instead be someone who leads a better example.  I suggest perhaps that he is replaced with Rob Gronkowski (nickname: Gronk) of the New England Patriots.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNavigate to the NSPersonNameComponents.h header file in the Foundation framework, search for \"A-Rod\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSomeone with a better character than Alex Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlex Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 Beta 1 SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
