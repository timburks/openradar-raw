        Summary:
        When presenting a view controller for the first time in my custom container view controller, the navigation bar has a visual bug before the beginning of the animation and jumps once the animation ends.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the attached project and click on the top-left button item.

        Expected Results:
        It should behave as it does once the view controller has already been presented once.

        Regression:
        This problem also seems to happen on iOS 8.0
