    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8, hitting reply in Mail.app would start your new message 2 lines above the previous. Now it's only 1 in iOS 9. This doesn't look nearly as clean.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReply to any message in Mail\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want to start my reply two lines above the previous message, i.e. there should be an empty line in between where I'm starting my message and the previous message I'm replying to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new message starts directly above the previous message"
