    description: "1. Be on iPad\n2. Open Mail\n3. Start a new message\n4. Tap on the camera icon on the keyboard shortcuts bar\n\nResult: the photo picker’s popover is awkwardly pointing to the top ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n\nExpected: the popover pointer should point at the camera icon on the keyboard. Probably."
