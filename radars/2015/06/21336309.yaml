    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading my watch to the watchOS2 beta, \"location services\" didn't appear to work correctly anymore. I noticed this by two things:\r\n* the weather app displayed  the weather for the South Atlantic Ocean (a place I'm obviously not present at): (screenshot: http://c.inferis.org/image/1s0R393K0m0E/IMG_0021.jpg)\r\n* while doing a cycling workout, I had no \"speed\" indication nor distance coverage (screenshot: http://c.inferis.org/image/14251E35303n/IMG_0032.jpg and http://c.inferis.org/image/1t1h1Q2N1Q0S/IMG_0033.jpg)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* weather show me local weather\r\n* I get distance and speed coverage while workout cycling\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* weather shows data for South Atlantic Ocean\r\n* no speed indication while cycling, and no  covered distance report when workout done\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSounds like a 0,0 problem to me.\r\n\r\nRestarting the iPhone and the watch did not remedy this problem.\r\nUnpairing and repairing the watch with my iPhone fixed this problem. I wasn't able to reproduce this afterward.\r\nSo while the problem is solved in my case, it is still an issue for the upgrade process: you don't want users to have to repair their watches, I guess. :)"
