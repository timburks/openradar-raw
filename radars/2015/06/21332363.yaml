        Summary:
        UIPopoverController now has a shadow since iOS 9. However, that shadow is not animated when the popover animates. See attached gif; because of the compression this is really well noticeable.

        This behaviour is in pretty much every app, so no example is needed.

        Looks like the shadow is laid out via auto layout, might be a reason why it doesnâ€™t animate.

        Dima from UIKit pushed me in the labs to file this bug :)
