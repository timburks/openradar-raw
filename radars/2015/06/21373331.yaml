        Let’s face it: bugreport.apple.com is, in technical terms, shit.

        It’s slow, looks bad, and makes filing bugs dreadful for any iOS, Mac (and Watch!) developer. This is, of course, bad for developers, it’s bad for the users, and ultimately, bad for Apple.

        The experience of reporting bugs (by people who aren’t paid to do so, yet ultimately help Apple) should be as simple and easy as possible.

        Time to get real.

        We need new bugreport.apple.com.

        And if you’re feeling generous, a Mac app for filing bugs, or an official JSON API so that the community can make one, would be wonderful.

        Thanks for your consideration.
