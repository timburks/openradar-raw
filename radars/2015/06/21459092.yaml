    description: "Summary:\r\nitunes.apple.com links shared on Twitter include a preview image of the artwork for the media being shared. The iTunes Link Maker (https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/en-us/?urlDesc=) recently began prefixing URLs with geo (i.e. geo.itunes.apple.com). Geo links solve localization issues for certain types of media, but they no longer support artwork previews in Twitter. Artwork previews are a great way to make tweets stand out and attract additional clicks for people who use the affiliate linking program so it would be great to see this feature added to geo.tunes.apple.com links.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select \"Copy Link\" from share button in any iTunes media offered on the iTunes Store.\r\n2. Share link on Twitter.\r\n3. The shared link is in the format of iTunes.apple.com and will include an artwork preview.\r\n4. Create a link using iTunes Link Maker -- https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com.\r\n5. Share link on Twitter.\r\n6. The share link is in the format of geo.itunes.apple.com and will NOT include an artwork preview.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy expectation was that geo.tunes.apple.com links would include the same media artwork previews available with iTunes.apple.com links when shared on Twitter.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo artwork preview is available for geo.tunes.apple.com links shared on Twitter."
