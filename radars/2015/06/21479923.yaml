    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the device is unlocked into an app such as Messages after viewing Wallet on the lock screen, the white status bar remains present and is rendered over the much more readable black status bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Messages on a device with passcode lock (or Touch ID) enabled.\r\n2. Lock the device without exiting \r\n3. Turn on the display, and from the lock screen, double-click the Home button to activate Wallet.\r\n4. Exit Wallet with the Home button.\r\n5. Unlock the device using either Touch ID or passcode.\r\n6. Look at the status bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStatus bar would have black text and outlines\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlack status bar is hidden by white status bar, creating readability and stylistic issues\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue is resolved by exiting the app after unlocking and reopening it."
