    description: "Passbook passes only allow a “relevantDate”. Some use cases require a specific range to be specified, with a start and an end date, in particular for train tickets in Europe.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nProvide train tickets using pkpass files to passengers. Set the relevantDate to the train departure date.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpon inspection, the pass is directly available of the passenger’s phone lock screen. The passenger can simply show it to the manager.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSince inspection happens at a random time during travel, the pass is no longer considered relevant by Passbook and it’s no longer available on the lock screen. The passenger has to find Passbook (now Wallet), or search through their emails to find the pass again. They are disappointed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis isn’t new to iOS 9: this has been a limitation since (at least) iOS7.\r\n\r\nSee also issue 16646691, requesting a longer implicit range for train boarding passes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iPhone\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
