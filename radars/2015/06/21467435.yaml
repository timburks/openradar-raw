        1. Open Safari
        2. Long press on a link
        3. A context menu popover shows up with some actions related to the link

        Expected: One of those actions is a generic “Share” action which shows the standard iOS 8+ share sheet/popover, including all the 3rd party apps

        Actually: Nope. There’s open, copy, and save to Reading List. But no share.

        Notes: This doesn’t apply only to Safari, where you can easily open a link in new tab and then use the share button on the top bar. This applies to all apps using web views, including Mail, and many 3rd party apps.
