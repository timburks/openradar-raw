    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen swiping downwards to dismiss photos in Messages, Photos, or any default Apple application that added this feature in iOS 9, it disregards any sort of velocity when dismissing and feels extremely awkward. The image animates towards a predefined location without taking into account the velocity at which it was thrown to dismiss. In addition the sole direction the image can be dismissed is downards which is counter-intuitive to me, as I like throwing images upwards to dismiss them in applications such as Facebook Messenger, Tweetbot, and Twitter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Messages.\r\n2. Open an image in a conversation.\r\n3. Touch and drag the image downwards to dismiss it (throw it).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should dismiss as is, but it should also take into account the speed at which the image was throw based on touches. In it's current implementation it sorta just stops, loses all speed, and then moves to it's original location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage dismisses without any regard for the velocity which it was thrown, nor does it allow for dismissing upwards.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApps like Paper, Facebook, and Messenger implement this feature quite nicely, and might be useful to get a better idea of how it could work."
