    description: "Summary:\r\nCFPreferencesSynchronize() seems to always return true. If the file it would write is a directory rather than a file, it can't be written to, of course. But CFPreferencesSynchronize() will still return true.\r\n\r\nThe attached sample iOS app demonstrates the issue. It creates a directory where the preferences file is expected to be written, then call CFPreferencesSynchronize(), which of course can't overwrite the directory with a file, but still returns true.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a directory in the path that CFPreferencesSynchronize() should try to write to as a file.\r\n2. Call CFPreferencesSynchronize()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCFPreferencesSynchronize() should return false\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCFPreferencesSynchronize() returns true\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.4 (14E36b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on OS X and iOS.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UserPrefsSyncTester.zip' was successfully uploaded."
