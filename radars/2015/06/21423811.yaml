    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently we only have the option to set the deceleration rate of UIScrollViews to NORMAL or FAST. In the case of a WKWebView, changing the deceleration rate to NORMAL causes rendering issues when scrollling too fast down the page. Ideally we would like to be able to change the deceleration rate to NORMAL and avoid the tiling issues we're seeing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set deceleration rate of WKWebView's scrollView to NORMAL\r\n2. Load app onto iPad Air, displaying the WKWebView.\r\n3. Load a long content page\r\n4. Scroll really fast down the page.\r\n5. Notice grey/tiling rendering issues in the webview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWKWebView should display web content\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWKWebView displays grey where web content should be and doesn't render in a timely manner\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air (Wifi)"
