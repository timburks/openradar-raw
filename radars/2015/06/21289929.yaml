        Summary:
        A framework that linked fine with Xcode 6.3+ & Swift 1.2 can’t link when upgraded.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Download https://github.com/robrix/Prelude
        2. Open the xcodeproj in Xcode 7
        3. Do the conversion stuff
        4. Build


        Expected Results:
        Successful build


        Actual Results:
        Link failure:

        Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
          "_CFStringGetCStringPtr", referenced from:
              fixStringForCoreData(objc_object*) in libarclite_macosx.a(arclite.o)
          "_kCFCoreFoundationVersionNumber", referenced from:
              __ARCLite__load() in libarclite_macosx.a(arclite.o)
        ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
        clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)


        Regression:
        A workaround is to link the framework target against CoreFoundation. Note that this was not necessary before.

        If it’s actually expected to be necessary now, it’d be good to have it added to the converter. Oh and docs would be good.
