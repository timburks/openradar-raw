        extension UnsafeBufferPointer: Sliceable {
            public subscript (bounds: Range<Index>) -> UnsafeBufferPointer<T> {
                return(UnsafeBufferPointer(start: self.baseAddress + bounds.startIndex, count: bounds.count))
            }
        }

        Since UnsafeBufferPointer is intended to provide a Collection interface, and it is efficiently Sliceable, it makes sense to make it Sliceable.
