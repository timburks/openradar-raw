    description: "Summary:\r\nImporting a custom framework into a Playground causes it to cease executing. No errors are reported. The IDE claims the playground executed successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) In Xcode beta (7A120f) create an iOS framework project and add a Swift file with a simple public function.\r\n2) Create a workspace and add the above project.\r\n3) Create a playground and add it to the above workspace.\r\n4) Add a print statement to the playground, notice that it executes.\r\n5) Add an import statement for the framework created in step 1\r\n6) Notice the print statement no longer executes\r\n7) Notice it is also impossible to call the function defined in the framework.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to import the framework and execute functions in the framework.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAdding the import statement seems to cause the code in the playground to stop executing. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a regression from 6.3.1 (6D1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workspace demonstrating the issue has been attached to this radar."
