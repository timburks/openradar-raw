    description: "Summary:\r\nOur application allows the user to preview a document, and then send it to another app using UIDocumentInteractionController.  However, we need to do some transformation on the document before it is actually sent to the other app, so we implemented the delegate method willBeginSendingToApplication:, in which we apply the transform to a copy of the original document and change the URL property to point to the modified file.  This works correctly in prior versions of iOS up to and including 8.4.  However on iOS 9 the change to the URL property is not recognized, and the original un-modified document is sent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project\r\n2. Run the app on an iOS 8 device, and tap the \"Open\" button to send the document to any other app.\r\n3. The receiving app should get a different file than the original - this is good.\r\n4. Run the app on an iOS 9 device, and repeat the process.\r\n5. The receiving app gets the un-modified file - this is bad!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanges to the UIDocumentInteractionController's URL property are correctly honored.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanges to the UIDocumentInteractionController's URL property are not correctly propagated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 Beta 2, build 13A4280e\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2 running iOS 8.4, iPad Air 2 running iOS 9 beta 2 \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DocTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
