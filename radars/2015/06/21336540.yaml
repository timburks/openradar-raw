        Summary:
        In Tweetbot, when rotating your device landscape and then replying to a tweet open the compose tweet screen but with a too wide keyboard.

        See: http://c.inferis.org/image/282F0A3F1T1U/IMG_0038.jpg

        Steps to Reproduce:
        0. Hold your phone in portrait mode
        1. Open Tweetbot so that is shows your timeline
        2. Rotate your phone to landscape (make sure rotation lock is not on). The view will not rotate along.
        3. select a tweet and hit reply
        4. compose tweet screen comes up, keyboard -> fubar

        Expected Results:
        Keyboard should be portrait sized.
        -or-
        Compose view should be in landscape mode.

        Actual Results:
        Compose view stays in portrait, but keyboard is too wide.

        Notes:
        Rotating your phone back to portrait then to landscape correctly changes the compose view to landscape mode (see: http://c.inferis.org/image/1k1v152g0N1j/IMG_0040.jpg). Then rotating it back to portrait fixes the portrait keyboard as well (see: http://c.inferis.org/image/1Z0u0O3N0y3O/IMG_0041.jpg)

        There's also another issue with this scenario but I'll file a separate radar.
