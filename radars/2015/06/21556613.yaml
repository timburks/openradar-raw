        Xcode, including the Xcode 7 beta, only supports GCC 4.2, which among other things does not include a functional C++11 regex standard library implementation. This was added in the libstdc++ that shipped with 4.9.

        GCC 4.9 has been out over a year, and 4.9.2 has been stable since Oct 2014. I propose that its implementation of libstdc++ be shipped with Xcode 7.
