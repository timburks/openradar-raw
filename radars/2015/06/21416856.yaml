Release a new version\r\n2. Have problems\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStaged rollout to 10% of users - see if all fine and then release to 100% - if not make a bugfix and release to 100%\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll customers get a update - if they have problems with the new version they have to wait a long time for a fix"
