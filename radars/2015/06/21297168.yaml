    description: "Summary:\r\nScreen goes black on rotating to Landscape using Navigation Controller in UITabbarController. This only happens to tab number 6 and 7 due to the fact that in Landscape the number of items outside the More Controller are 7 instead of 4 on iphone 6+ IOS8.3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- Make a single view application.\r\n2- Drag a UiTabbarController on Story board.\r\n3- Drag 9 to 10 navigation Controllers on StoryBoard.\r\n4- Make these navigation Controllers the viewControllers of TabBarController.\r\n5- For sake of understanding you can change the background color of each View Controller in navigation Controller.\r\n6- Run the app and tap on 6th or 7th tab.\r\n7- After the view of 6th tab appears , rotate the device to landscape.\r\n8- The screen blacks out.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe screen should not black out and remain the same as it was.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screen goes black.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nIOS8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIphone 6+\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BUG.mov' and 'Tabstest.zip' were successfully uploaded."
