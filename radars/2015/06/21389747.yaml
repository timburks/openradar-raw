        Summary:
        The new “universal links” system allows applications to specify “associated domains,” domains whose links the application can intercept. These domains look as follows; please note that a separate entry is required for each specific subdomain:

        applinks:service-now.com
        applinks:www.service-now.com

        ServiceNow uses a different subdomain for each customer’s instance, e.g. my team instance can be found at “http://hello.service-now.com”

        In order to open blogs links in the native ServiceNow app, we would need to be able to specify a wildcarded associated domain as follows:

        applinks:*.service-now.com

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try using an asterisk to specify a wildcarded associated domain (e.g. “*.service-now.com”) for universal links.

        Expected Results:
        Links to any subdomain under the domain (e.g. “hello.service-now.com”) would be routed to the third-party application.

        Actual Results:
        Links to subdomains open in Safari.

        Regression:
