    description: "Summary:\r\nSince installing iOS 8.4 beta 4 on a device which was running 8.3 I am not able to use the camera in my apps any more.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- download Appleâ€™s example app: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/PhotoPicker/PhotoPicker.zip\r\n- run it on a device with iOS 8.4 beta 4\r\n- not able to use ( front or back ) camera\r\n- app/system fails to request my permission to use the system camera\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs a user I expect to see an alert asking me for my permission to use the camera in this app\r\nAs a user I expect to see an entry under settings > privacy > camera > my app\r\nAs a user I expect to see an entry under settings > my app > camera ( toggle )\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system does not ask the user for permission.  There is no way for the user ( or the developer ) to allow the app to use the system camera.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nApple example app works with 8.3 on my iPhone 6 but not on my iPhone 6 Plus which is running 8.4 beta 4.\r\nI used to be able to use the system app just fine on the iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 8.3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI updated the iPhone 6 Plus from 8.3 to 8.4 beta 4"
