        Summary:
        Turn on the “Filter Unknown Senders” setting in Settings > Messages. This adds an “Unknown Senders” section in the messages app. This section remains empty while the unknown sends remain in the “Contacts & SMS” section.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Update to iOS 9.
        2) Turn on “Filter Unknown Senders”
        3) Unknown SMS remain in “Contacts & SMS” instead of “Unknown Senders”

        Expected Results:
        SMS Messages from unknown numbers should be in the “Unknown Senders” section. “Contacts & SMS” should probably be renamed to simply “Contacts”.

        Actual Results:
        SMS messages aren’t filtered by Unknown Senders

        Regression:
        None.
