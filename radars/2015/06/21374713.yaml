        Summary:
        When building the sample project with Xcode 7 you get two unexpected warnings.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Build sample project available at https://github.com/JanX2/NSCodingDesignatedInitializer

        Expected Results:
        No warnings.

        Actual Results:
        Two warnings:
        MyTestFormatter.m:35:16: Convenience initializer should not invoke an initializer on 'super'
        MyTestFormatter.m:33:1: Convenience initializer missing a 'self' call to another initializer

        Regression:
        Worked fine in Xcode 6.3.2.

        Notes:
        You can work around the issue by setting ENABLE_WORKAROUND=1 in the sample project.
