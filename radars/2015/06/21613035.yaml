    description: "Update: \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt appears the UIStackView does indeed respect the `layoutMargins` if you set `layoutMarginsRelativeArrangement = true`. However, it appears that setting these values explicitly in Interface Builder doesn't work. It does work when you set them in code. It would be great (and less confusing) if the IB settings are respected.\r\n\r\nThe IB settings are indicated in the screenshots.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached .zip file.\r\n2. Open attached xcode project through workspace.\r\n3. Double-check IB setting for the UIStackView (see screenshots)\r\n4. Run project.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n* UIStackView looks as on the right of the attached example.png.\r\nUIStackView layoutMargins: C.UIEdgeInsets(top: 20.0, left: 20.0, bottom: 20.0, right: 20.0) and layoutMarginsRelativeArrangement: true\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n* UIStackView looks as on the left of the attached example.png (margins not respected).\r\n* Log states: \"UIStackView layoutMargins: C.UIEdgeInsets(top: 0.0, left: 0.0, bottom: 0.0, right: 0.0) and layoutMarginsRelativeArrangement: false\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can uncomment line 20, 21 and 22 in ViewController.swift to set the values in code.\r\n'nwaalertcontroller-update.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\nhttps://github.com/SpacyRicochet/NWAAlertController/commit/6d144579646ab919e88bd16cc18984cc6db28422\r\n\r\nPrevious:\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA common way to use UIStackView-like views (such as UIStackView) is to insert a number of arranged subviews, but keep a small amount of padding between the edges of the UIStackView and the arranged subviews. Like what the `layoutMargins` are supposed to achieve when you use constraints that respect them.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is currently hard to achieve with a standard UIStackView without either nesting them over and over again, or creating a surplus of extra spacing views. This also makes UIStackViews which have padding harder to maintain.\r\n\r\nA ‘padding’ variable would make life way easier when creating these kinds of views.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a"
