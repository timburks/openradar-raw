    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen logging HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSexualActivity, the metadata HKMetadataKeySexualActivityProtectionUsed should more likely be an enumeration of types of sexual protection, rather than a boolean of whether or not protection was used. There are many types of protection available, and depending on what is being protected against, multiple types may be used. For instance, the enumerated values of \"condom\" and \"birth control pill\" might be combined.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Meet partner.\r\n2. Um...ask your parents...\r\n3. Use new app to log details of step 2.\r\n4. Discover STD, go back through health kit data to review how.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotice that you only logged that a birth-control pill was used, not a condom.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotice that you only logged that \"protection\" was used. Wonder how disease manifested when you took precautions."
