        Summary:
        When a method, on an Objective-C subclass, is declared private in Swift and used as a gesture recognizer action there is a crash at runtime when the gesture recognizer attempts to call it’s action.

        *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception ‘NSInvalidArgumentException’, reason: ‘-[GestureRecognizers.SwiftGestureRecognizerExampleViewController handleTap:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fec3a7ac8b0’

        The reason is that, somewhat confusingly, private methods do not have the @objc modifier automatically added. This seems to go against Swift’s ‘designed for safety’ feature. There is no warning, just a crash at runtime.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Subclass an Objective-C class
        2. Create a gesture recognizer, add it to a view. Use the Objective-C subclass as the target and a private method as the action
        3. Trigger the gesture at runtime

        Expected Results:
        No crash would be nice, but even better, and more in line with Swift, would be a compiler warning.

        Actual Results:
        Crasher and no warning.
