    description: "Description:\r\n\r\nI drive 160 miles a day during my commute, and so without doing almost any other physical activity, I fill meet my 500 calorie Move goal for the day. I'm not sure whether it's the bumpy highway pavement I often encounter, or the motion associated with moving the steering wheel, but the watch shows a lot of calories burned. I suppose, it could also be an elevated heart rate associated with driving, but that seems less likely\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. Wear Watch\r\n2. Drive over 80 miles of highway\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\nMove calorie count has not changed, or changed only minimally\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\r\nI'm seeing over 100 calories"
