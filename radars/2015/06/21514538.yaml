    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 9, selecting text in Mail and other apps now includes a \"Share\" option. This is great. But if you want to share a link it gets trickier. That includes regular text that has been automatically turned into a linkâ€”like an address, phone number, date, tracking number, and so on. You're forced to do this weird maneuver where you select outside the link and then move or expand the selection to include it. It'd be a lot simpler if you could long press on the link itself and get a \"Share\" option there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Mail app\r\n2. Open an email with a link or auto-linked text like a phone number\r\n3. Long press on the link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA \"Share\" option should be included in the menu of options that pops up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no \"Share\" option.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 (13A4280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2, Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
