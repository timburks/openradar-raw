    description: "Summary:\r\nOn the Apple bluetooth-dev mailing list, Jason Conn had this to say about state restoration after reboot:\r\n\r\nJason Conn says:\r\n\r\n> State restoration across a reboot is not currently supported. If itâ€™s something you desire, please file a bug - that helps us gauge interest.\r\n\r\nI assume this includes kernel-panic or other forced reboots.\r\n\r\nFrom the user experience point of view it would be pretty surprising to find your medical equipment no longer connected when your phone reboots silently in your pocket (Cochlear hearing medical equipment is what I am developing CoreBluetooth code for - Renaud and Brian know about the project - but also imagine your diabetes glucose pump loses communication with it's remote app because your iPhone rebooted silently in your pocket...)\r\n\r\nSecondly, does \"State restoration across a reboot is not currently supported\" specifically mean an OS reboot or will state restoration not occur if the core bluetooth daemon crashes and then restarts? If the latter then this is much more a bug than an enhancement request...\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1"
