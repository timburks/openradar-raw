    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Render Documentation\" playground setting checkbox is used to toggle between the very pretty 'view' mode to a plain text 'edit' mode. Authors of these marked-up documentation blocks will frequently need to edit the docs, but still want to leave the doc in 'view' mode before sharing. Also, it's handy to preview how the doc will render.\r\n\r\nRevealing the File Inspector for a playground just to access the \"Render Documentation\" checkbox takes up more screen real estate than desired on smaller MacBook screens. It would be very nice if this setting could be toggled with a key binding. It doesn't necessarily need to be bound to any specific keys, even open to the user to bind would be perfect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a playground in Xcode 6.3\r\n2. Reveal the File Inspector\r\n3. Observe the Render Documentation checkbox\r\n4. Open Xcode Preferences\r\n5. Navigate to the Key Bindings tab\r\n6. Search for \"reveal\" or \"documentation\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA key binding for \"Render Documentation\" will be listed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo key binding for \"Render Documentation\" is available.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Key binding in Xcode 7 is called \"Show Rendered Markup\""
