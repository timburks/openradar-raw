    description: "Summary:\r\nFor the past year or so I've been hoping we'd eventually see a new extension-based Spotlight API that's shared between iOS and OS X. CoreSpotlight in iOS 9 is exactly what I was hoping for… but really I'd like to see it on the Mac too.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are already Spotlight APIs on OS X, but when it comes to indexing data that's not normally stored in external files, they are overcomplicated and buggy. My apps use Core Data and they're sandboxed—neither of which is unusual. Indexing apps like these has always been challenging, was completely broken for all of Mavericks ( see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21392278/record-level-spotlight-indexing-with-coredata ), and even now I'm struggling to get it working right. Even if it all worked perfectly, CoreSpotlight seems like a much more straightforward, modern, and flexible approach.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A178w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\n2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
