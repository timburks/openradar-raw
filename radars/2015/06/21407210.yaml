    description: "When the bot is exporting the archive to a .ipa file, the process fails with the following error:\r\n\r\nexportArchive: exportOptionsPlist error for key 'uploadSymbols': expected a value of class NSNumber, but found (null)\r\n\r\nAfter some research, fairly positive this is a bug dealing with App Thinning."
