    description: "Summary:\r\nAlthough Watch is advertised as having 50 ms accuracy, it is close to impossible to efficiently read the exact time from it.\r\n\r\nThe analog watchfaces have continuous second/minute hand movement, which of course fits the nature of time itself, but you have to really concentrate to tell the exact minute if the hand is somethere in between.\r\n\r\nAnd even worse, there is no way to display seconds at all on any digital watchface. There is not even a complication available that shows seconds.\r\n\r\nFor me, as one who frequently needs quick exact time readings, this is a major frustration with Apple Watch. You would think that quickly reading the exact time should be a major design goal, at least as a customization option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook at the watch\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nQuickly be able to tell the exact time including seconds\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAnalog: need too much time to discern minutes\r\nDigital: not being able to tell if it's 10:09:01 or 10:09:59"
