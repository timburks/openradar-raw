        Summary:
        After an app receives its device token from APNS, it should be able to invalidate the token locally and obtain another.

        In my app, we connect to many different arbitrary servers. When we log out of a particular server, the server stops sending our app push notifications. However, if the app canâ€™t connect to the network, the server from which we log out might still send our app push notifications. We might never be able to connect to that app again if the server is behind a VPN and we lost VPN access. However, the server might still dutifully send us push notifications because the server can still talk to APNS and APNS can still talk to our device.
