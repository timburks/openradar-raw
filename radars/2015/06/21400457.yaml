    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that currently the Bluetooth controller in the iOS devices uses an \"instant\" of +13 connection events in the LL_CONNECTION_UPDATE_REQ link layer command.\r\n\r\nOur accessory uses relatively long (let's say ~600ms) connection intervals to conserve energy. When the user interacts with the accessory, it requests a shorter interval to improve the responsiveness during user interactions. However, this takes 600ms * 13 = 7.8 seconds for such a change to take effect. This is unacceptably long.\r\n\r\nThe Bluetooth 4.0 specification prescribes a minimum of +6 connection events. This would decreases the delay to 3.6 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe started using the Slave Latency feature to overcome part of the delay. Using 4 as Slave Latency and 150ms as connection interval, a similar power profile is met. The cost of switching now is 150ms * 13 = 1950ms, which is still a noticeable delay for the user. If the minimum \"instant\" distance of +6 connection events would be used, the delay would be cut down to 150ms * 6 = 900ms.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on iPhone 5, iOS 9 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 5, iOS 9 beta 1\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
