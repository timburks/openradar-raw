    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you type on the iOS 9 keyboard, the keys don't highlight anymore. This does not hamper typing at all, but it feels strangely off. Probably because there's no feedback at all that you actually hit a key (apart from the character appearing in whatever text field you're typing into). \r\n\r\nThere's also no keyboard click, even though I've turned them on in my settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find a control where you can type in\r\n2. Give the control focus\r\n3. Start typing after keyboard appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn visual (and perhaps auditive) on-keyboard indication that I'm pressing (and potentially holding) a key.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo visual (or auditive) indication occurs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLoving the new keyboard overall, great work. :)"
