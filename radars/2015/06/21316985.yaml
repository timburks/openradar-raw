    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Media Service (AMS) provides an API to send different \"remote commands\" to the Player Entity (the app that is playing back media). For example, Play, Pause, Next Track, etc. More esoteric commands like \"Advance Shuffle Mode\" and \"Bookmark\" are also supported.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no way to query AMS what commands the Player supports. The Media Remote (the accessory / client of AMS) can therefore not decide to hide buttons for commands that are not supported and therefore not relevant. The result is a confusing user experience on the Media Remote, for the commands that are not supported by every Player (like Bookmark, Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down, Advance Shuffle Mode, etc.)\r\n\r\nOur request is simple: add a way to query what remote commands the Player supports.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious way to do with would be to add an attribute to the Player entity: a bitfield where each bit position would map to the Remote Command ID and a '1' would mean \"supported\" and a '0' would mean 'unsupported'.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 1 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 (A1429)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
