        The following fails to compile at the top level:


            let optX: Int? = 0

            guard let realX = optX else {
                fatalError()
            }

            let y = realX // Use of unresolved identifier ‘realX’
            print("\(y)\n")

        —

        However, if it is wrapped in a do{} block, works as expected:

        do {
            let optX: Int? = 0

            guard let realX = optX else {
                fatalError()
            }

            let y = realX // Use of unresolved identifier
            print("\(y)\n")
        }

        At the top level, this should either generate a warning or should generate a new scope as expected.
