    description: "1. Be on iPad\n2. Open Mail\n3. Compose new message\n4. Make sure you have both the shortcuts bar AND predictive keyboard turned on\n5. You’ll see that B / I / U buttons have been grouped into a single button\n6. Tap on that.\n\nOn the first try, you’ll see a nice popover coming out of it, with B, I, U buttons. \n\nOn the second, and subsequent tries, that popover will be broken (like on the screenshot)"
