    description: "Summary:\r\nIn this case, I accessed the camera from the lock screen, and the button I would normally use to take the photo was missing.  This caused me to miss a photo moment with good lighting. \r\n\r\nForce-quitting the camera app and restarting restored normal functionality.  In limited testing I was not able to reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a good photo moment.\r\n2. Access the camera from the lock screen by swiping up from the bottom right corner of the screen. \r\n3. No photo button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the camera to behave normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe camera button to take the photo is missing.   The rest of the view seemed normal. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta"
