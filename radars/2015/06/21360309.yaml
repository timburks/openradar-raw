    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I load a storyboard in Xcode 6.3.2 on the El Capitan WWDC release, the storyboard gets many <animations/> elements added to it, which makes for a noisy, unnecessary diff.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a Storyboard in Xcode 6.3.2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Storyboard opens, and that's IT.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe storyboard is marked as dirty, and the file has actually changed despite me not saving anything.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3.2\r\nOS X 10.11 WWDC Developer Preview\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would also appreciate it if storyboard files weren't changed just because they're opened (or saved with no actual changes) on a different OS or Xcode release. Unless I actually change something in the file, it's not important that I've opened it in a different version.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
