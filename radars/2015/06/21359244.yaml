    description: "Xcode has been extended with a huge amount of features. It was not fast and had numerous problems back in version 6. If it grows even more, the experience is likely to get worse. App developers use text editor and debugger for 90+% of the time. They don’t need the rest to be running and wasting resources all the time. \r\n\r\nIt is hard to develop huge apps. If it was split into several applications it could logically make development easier. UX would probably get better.\r\n\r\nSeparation of concerns is always a good thing.\r\n\r\nIt would also create new possibilities for future development. One of the obvious examples is Interface Builder — it might be a great tool for designers."
