    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, Xcode generates a .xccoverage file inside a project’s DerivedData folder. This file seems to be a binary plist, which is not very convenient for reading and exporting to another format. There’s also no way to specify its path when running xcodebuild.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a project with some tests.\r\n2) Run the tests with xcodebuild:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild test -scheme MyProjectScheme -sdk iphonesimulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA more standard file should be generated or a tool to convert to one should be available. Other possible formats are Cobertura XML or even GCOV’s files. The file should also be saved to another location (should be a parameter to xcodebuild or inside the project/scheme configurations).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA binary plist is generated on a default location.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nCode coverage was not available prior to Xcode 7, so no regressions here.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot everyone can use Bots as a Continuous Integration environment, so this will make it possible to show code coverage on other tools, such as Jenkins."
