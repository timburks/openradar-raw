        Summary:
        Developing for the watch and for iOS, you need to switch between both simulators quite often. Also going back to Xcode (or other editors) messes up the app order sooner or later.

        It would be cool to have the 2 simulators together so that you bring one app into focus, the other simulator joins the foreground. No need to go hunt down the other one like you do now.

        Probably as an option since you don't want this behavior all the time. Then again, if you don't need one of the simulators you can close it.
