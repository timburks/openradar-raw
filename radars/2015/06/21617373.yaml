        Summary:
        Mail in Yosemite has a serious regression in reading functionality.  The function for View -> Select -> "All Messages in this Conversation" is broken.

        This bug affects both IMAP and Exchange accounts.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1] Mail connected to an Exchange or IMAP (i.e. iCloud) account.
        2] Have several messages in a single conversation thread.
        3] Select one message.  It highlights.
        4] Observe that other messages in the thread soft-highlight as well.


        Expected Results:
        1] Select View -> Select submenu.
        2] "All Messages in this Conversation" (Shift-Command-K) should be available.
        3] Selection highlight should expand to include all messages in the thread.

        Actual Results:
        "All Messages in this Conversation" is not available. (Greyed out)
        Keyboard command (Shift-CMD-K) is also unavailable.

        Regression:
        Feature works as expected in Mavericks and prior.
        Feature is broken in all releases of Yosemite, including 10.10.3 and 10.10.4.
