    description: "Summary:\nFor watchOS 1 and  Watch Kit in Xcode 6.2 and higher it was possible to simulate Force Touch with a long press on a Mac without a ForceTouch Trackpad.\nWith Xcode 7 Beta 1 and watchOS Simulator this is no longer possible. You have to switch between the touch intensity in the options to enable ForceTouch on click.\n\nThis is a bit unconvienent also I understand that this differentiation is necessary to keep to behavior of a long touch when pressing long.\n\nBut an option would be great to enable ForceTouch on long press or replace the current one with Long Touch or Force Touch on long press. In the current situation it is really annoying to test for example the ForceTouch menu in the watch sim.\n\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Run any project in the watch sim which has an ForceTouch menu implemented\n2. Long press \n3. Nothing Happens\n\nExpected Results:\n3. Simulate a ForceTouch depending on the press duration\n\nActual Results:\n3. A long touch is performed"
