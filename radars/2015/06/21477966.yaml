    description: "For most of my classes (such as the one in the screenshot) Xcode does not highlight most element types. Keywords, basic types (@\"\", @, numbers), and documentation always work, but class names, variables, and constants often do not.\r\n\r\nSometimes the highlighting works fully for a few seconds when first opening the file, then falls back to the limited subset described.\r\n\r\nAll this also applies in the same way to autocomplete."
