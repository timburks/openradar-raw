    description: "Summary:\r\nOne of the main limitations of using Xcode in full screen mode is that you have to switch desktops to see the iOS simulator. \r\n\r\n10.11's split screen mode offers a solution to this problem, except that the iOS Simulator doesn't work with it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Open iOS Simulator\r\n3. Make Xcode window full screen\r\n4. Open Mission Control\r\n5. Attempt to drag iOS Simulator window on top of full screen Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the iOS Simulator to be able to share a screen with Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS Simulator does not appear to support split screen mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 build 15A178w\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
