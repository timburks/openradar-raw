        Summary:
        For users enrolled in the OS X beta program, the system adds a “Send <appname> Feedback” menu item to the Help menu of all apps on the system, even third party apps. Selecting this menu item opens Apple’s feedback assistant, which allows users to send bug reports etc. on the OS X beta.

        I have had multiple reports from users who used this menu item in one of my apps and were confused that I had never received the information they had submitted. It is not at all clear to users that feedback sent by selecting that menu item is going to Apple, and not the app developer. This can cause support issues and poor customer sat for third party developers. This feedback menu item should only be displayed for Apple’s own applications, and not third party ones.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Enroll in the OS X beta program and install a beta seed
        2. Install and open any third party app
        3. Look in the Help menu

        Expected Results:
        The help menu should only contain items that I put there

        Actual Results:
        This additional feedback menu item appears

        Regression:
        According to at least one user, this menu item persists even after the user has installed a non-beta seed on their system, e.g. the release version of OS X 10.10.3. Merely being enrolled in the beta program causes the menu item to appear.
