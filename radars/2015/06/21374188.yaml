    description: "Summary:\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nAttempt to use AudioBufferList.mBuffers in Swift 2.0\n\n\nExpected Results:\nmBuffers should probably come in as an UnsafeBufferPointer<AudioBuffer> or some other Unsafe type\n\nActual Results:\nstruct AudioBufferList {\n    \n    var mNumberBuffers: UInt32\n    var mBuffers: (AudioBuffer) // this is a variable length array of mNumberBuffers elements\n    init()\n    init(mNumberBuffers: UInt32, mBuffers: (AudioBuffer))\n}\n\nRegression:\nThis never seems to have come in correctly."
