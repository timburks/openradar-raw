    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the file picker — for example, when uploading an file in Safari — if the user selects “Photos”, the Photos display oldest to newest.\r\n\r\nMost people — especially now with iCloud Photo Library — will begin having sizeable photo libraries, spanning back several years. And, I would assume, most people would usually want to upload a *recently* taken photo, as opposed to the oldest photos in their library.\r\n\r\nPhotos in the file picker should, therefore either be displayed in reverse chronological order, with the newest photos at the top; or keep the picker from oldest at the top, but automatically scroll to the bottom of the list — like iOS does.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the file picker, for example, by clicking a file input to upload a file in Safari.\r\n2. Select “Photos” from the sidebar.\r\n3. Select a recently taken photo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe most recent photos are easily available to upload.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user must scroll down through an often sizeable list of photos before they are able to reach and upload the photo they want.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOn iOS, moments are clearly separated. This is not the case on OS X — adding clear separators for moments would help users find the a specific photo they’re looking for in a larger library."
