    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a test iPhone 6+ that we put aside for ~10 days. When we came back to it and tried to use the Apple Watch app, the app is hanging for more than 10 seconds on every single screen for every action you try to do, be it tapping a button, scrolling, etc. Logs are attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Watch app on iPhone 6+ after an indeterminate amount of time since last use (maybe ~10 days)\r\n2. Try to do anything: Scroll, tap a button\r\n3. It's incredibly slow, hanging for more than 10 seconds on every action\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Apple Watch app should be functional and should not hang, no matter how long it's been since last use\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Apple Watch app hangs on the iPhone 6+ after ~10 days since last use\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'hangLogs.txt' was successfully uploaded."
