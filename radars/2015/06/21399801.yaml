        Summary:

        Spotlight is a common way to launch apps; in fact it’s the way I normally launch apps. But I very, very rarely ever want to go back to Spotlight search results after launching an app in this way. However iOS presents the new “<Back to Search” whenever I launch apps from Spotlight.

        This is an annoyance, because I then can’t see whether the phone has connectivity, or whether it is an WWAN or wi-fi.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Go to Spotlight search
        2. Start typing the name of an installed app
        3. Select the app
        4. Observe “<Back to Search” is displayed in the iOS status bar
        5. Observe device connectivity info is obscured as a result

        Expected Results:

        I would expect “<Back to Search” to not be displayed when launching apps from Spotlight. I can see why this feature is useful for other search results however.

        Actual Results:

        “<Back to Search” is displayed, obscuring device connectivity info

        Regression:

        New in iOS 9

        Notes:

        FWIW I think “<Back to Search” is generally ill-conceived.  I think it should horizontally compress the status bar contents, rather than obscure information displayed in it.
