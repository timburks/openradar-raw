    description: "Summary:\r\nBackground: Our app requires the user to log in every time they use it, and logs the user out when entering background or after a period of inactivity. When logging out, the application replaces the window's current rootViewController with a new instance of our login view controller. This is to ensure all views and view controllers used during the userâ€™s session are removed.\r\n\r\nIf a view controller presentation is in progress when the window's -rootViewController is replaced, then the presented view controller, the presenting view controller, and their views are not deallocated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an application with three view controllers, A, B, and C.\r\n2. In application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:, create a window and set its root view controller to an instance of A.\r\n3. Use -presentViewController:animated:completion: to present an instance of B from A.\r\n4. Without dismissing B, set the window's root view controller to an instance of C.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView controllers A and B are deallocated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nView controllers A and B leak, together with their views.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 Simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn iOS 7.1, the view controllers A and B are deallocated as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8.3 Simulator"
