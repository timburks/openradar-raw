    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 9 added the following alert when you don't have enough space to install an update:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInsufficient Space For Download\r\n\r\nIn order to make room for the software update, some apps will need to be temporarily deleted. All deleted apps will automatically be replaced after the update is complete. Would you like to continue?\r\n\r\nCancel | Allow App Deletion\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis alert is scarier than it needs to be, and is going to prevent people from updating when it's really in their best interest to update and stay up to date with security fixes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install iOS 9 beta 1\r\n2. Fill up your hard drive\r\n3. Try to install iOS 9 beta 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect an alert with language closer to:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInsufficient Space For Download\r\n\r\nIn order to make room for the software update, some apps will need to be temporarily removed. All removed apps will automatically be reinstalled after the update is complete. Would you like to continue?\r\n\r\nCancel | Continue\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI know that \"Allow App Deletion\" is generally a better action button, but I suggest \"Continue\" here because as long as the developer of the removed app wasn't doing things wrong, there won't be any data loss. If you're trying to better protect Apple from the blame in those cases, then even \"Allow App Removal\" would be an improvement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alert is scarier than it needs to be and is going to prevent people from installing important updates.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone"
