        Summary:
        The simulator hangs on showing the white Apple logo on a black screen when running a project.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Start an iOS test project.
        2. Select a simulator in the project window's scheme selector.
        3. Select Product > Run

        Expected Results:
        Application should run, showing the white stock launch screen with project name the a blank white window.

        Actual Results:
        Simulator will boot, showing the white Apple logo and a progress bar. Progress bar disappears and the logo shows for as long as I care to wait (10-15 min).

        Notes:
        This behaviour persists after "Reset Content and Settings", deleting all simulators and re-installing the Xcode beta.
        I successfully launched a project in Xcode 7 beta 1 by removing derived data, deleting all my devices from the Devices window in Xcode and re-creating them. This trick has not worked in Beta 2.
