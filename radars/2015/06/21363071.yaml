    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be great to have a search bar in the multitasking view of the iPad. It's taking way too long to scroll trough the list and finding the app you're looking for.\r\n\r\nIt would be enough to just add a little search bar to the top of the multitasking split view. That would make it easier and more fun to select the app you want.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Swipe left to open the multitasking split view\r\n2. There you go: too many apps and too complicated to find the one you're looking for\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be quick and easy to add the app you want to the split view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's taking too long and is annoyingly messy."
