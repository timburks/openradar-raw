    description: "I’d like the ability to query NSPersonNameComponents for the typical set of expected name fields for a given locale (similar to how one can query `NSCalendar` for the first day of the week in a locale). \n\nCurrently (as far as I know) best practice for internationalized name input is to provide a free-form text input area and let the user populate it as they see fit. This is great in general, but sometimes lead to the problems `NSPersonNameComponentsFormatter` aims to fix; things like inappropriately truncating in the middle of a name. Allowing 3rd party devs to make use of `NSPersonNameComponentsFormatter` without requiring them to encode locale-based assumptions about name input would be very beneficial—and, I believe, prevent a lot of internationalization errors. Ideally the information returned would be ordered to account for, e.g., various cultures’ standards on family name placement.\n\nObviously name input is not a totally well-defined/specified problem, and freeform input should always be provided as a fallback, but this would serve as a useful heuristic to optimize the typical case."
