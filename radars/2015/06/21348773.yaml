        Summary:
        The compiler crashes both in a Playground and in a regular project with the following code:

        protocol Foo {
            static func bar()
        }

        struct Foz : Foo {
            static func bar() {
                print("Montoya")
            }
        }

        Foo.bar()

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Type the above into a playground. The crash happens in both Xcode 6.3.2 (6D2105) and 7.0 beta (7A120f).

        Expected Results:
        The type method getting called or at least a compile time error describing why I cannot call the type method of a protocol.

        Actual Results:
        Playground crashes / Xcode project fails to compile with an inscrutable error.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.
