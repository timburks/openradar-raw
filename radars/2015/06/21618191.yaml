    description: "Summary:\nWhen having a repository that doesn’t has it’s .xcodeproj at the same folder as the .git folder Xcode can not create a bot.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nUncompress the attached git repository and open one of its projects in Xcode. \nThen try to create a bot. \n\nExpected Results:\nXcode starts the bot creation wizard as usual \n\nActual Results:\nXcode presents a warning „Creating a bot requires that the project be under source control that is accessible by the server“ and allows the user to „Configure Remotes“. When pressing this button, it shows the Remotes tab empty. But when switching to one of the other tabs and back, it magically can figure out the git remote server. However, when pressing done Xcode close the dialog. When trying to create a bot again, the same things happen.\n\nRegression:\n\n\nNotes:\n\nHaving multiple projects in one repo can make the development process easier. For example pull requests can be done for changes of multiple projects at once (e.g. a base framework and an demo app). Having the possibility to structure this way, give developers more freedom to accomplish their goals. \n\nA workaround could be having all the .xcodeproj on the top level of repo. I did not try this, but I also think, that this would make the file structure more complicated."
