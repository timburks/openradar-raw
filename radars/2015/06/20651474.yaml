Cannot find anywhere to disable cursor \"zoom on shake\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should find a setting to disable mouse cursor \"zoom on shake\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot disable\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 developer release.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
