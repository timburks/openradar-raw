    description: "Several elements in the system have UIVibrancyEffect applied to compliment dark blur effects and provide contrast. When these elements are animated, however, they briefly lose their vibrant appearance, and take a dull gray tint color.\r\n\r\nThe best example is notifications. When you receive a notification on the Lock Screen, a dark blur effect is applied to the background. The separators of the notification cell are vibrant, and when you swipe on it, the dismiss 'x' button is also vibrant. When you tap on the dismiss button, the cell animates out of view with a subtle sliding animation. During this short animation, however, the separators and buttons lose their vibrant effect and appear an ugly gray color.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a notification on the Lock Screen (notice the vibrant separators)\r\n2. Swipe left to show dismiss button (notice the pretty vibrant button)\r\n3. Tap to dismiss the notification — watch carefully\r\n4. As the notification animates out, the vibrant separators and buttons appear gray\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the vibrant elements — separators and buttons — should maintain their vibrant effect through the animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDuring animation, the vibrant elements have a dull gray tint color"
