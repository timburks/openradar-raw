    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a NSStackView is configured to be used as a cell view in a NSTableView, and this stack view has views configured to be dropped as needed, the dropped views will never get reattached when there's enough space for them when expanding the tableview width.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Xcode 6.3\r\n2. Load attached sample program. It contains a window that has NSStackView's as rows. The stack view is configured to drop the button views in the centre gravity if the tableview width is shrunk.\r\n3. Shrink and expand the window width to compress/expand the tableview width.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the window width is shrunk, the buttons are detached from the stack view (rightmost first, etc.). When the window width is expanded, the buttons that were detached are reattached in reverse order.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe buttons do detach, but they never reattach.\r\n\r\nI've tried to alter the configuration of the stack view itself, and other views in the stack view (altering hugging/compression priorities, etc.) when all detachable views are detached, in an attempt to get the detached views to be reattached afterwards, but no changes I've tried corrected the problem (I would not expect to have to do this\r\n\r\nSample program at https://github.com/sebastienboisvert/stackViewTableViewTest"
