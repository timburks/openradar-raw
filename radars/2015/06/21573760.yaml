    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd love a setting to use one face/set of complications during certain days/hours and another face/set of complications outside those hours. During work days I like the Modular watch face with the large complication set to show the next Calendar event. Outside of working hours I prefer to use a different face as the next upcoming calendar item is of less importance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNo steps to reproduce as this feature does not exist yet.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo steps to reproduce as this feature does not exist yet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo steps to reproduce as this feature does not exist yet.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNo steps to reproduce as this feature does not exist yet."
