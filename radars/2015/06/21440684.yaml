    description: "Or is it “Add to Wallet”?\r\n\r\nThe current guidelines for Passbook provide png files with the Passbook logo that we’re supposed to embed to create custom UIButtons. Not only is this a bit tedious, it’s also fragile: whenever the Passbook logo or name changes, the app developers need to update the resources they embed, and make sure everything still looks OK.\r\n\r\nA “PKAddPassesButton” would make it look good, all the time. Additionally, a PKPaymentButton has been added in iOS 8.3 that servers a similar purpose for Apple Pay. This is just the same.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4254u)"
