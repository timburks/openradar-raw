        Summary:
        Caching Server is not very verbose and it is difficult to tell how “well” it works.

        For organizations with large volumes of iOS / OS X devices and multiple Caching Servers, we need more information with regards to data. This should be configurable as an Alert, so an admin can be e-mailed daily on the Caching Servers statistics.

        Information needed at minimum:
        	1. Daily / Monthly usage statistics on how much data was downloaded from Apple’s App Store.
        	2. Daily / Monthly usage statistics on how much data was served to client devices.
        	3. Daily / Monthly usage statistics on how much data was served to other Caching Server.
        	4. Daily / Monthly numbers on how many devices connected to the server, including unique devices.
        	5. Daily / Monthly numbers on what kind of client devices/models connected to the server (via model identifiers).
        	6. Daily / Monthly numbers on what iOS / OS X version the client devices are using.
        	7a. Daily / Monthly numbers on how many total files were downloaded.
        	7b. Daily / Monthly numbers on how many total downloads by each file type (Books, iOS Apps, Mac Apps, i/OS upgrades).
        	8a. Daily / Monthly numbers on how many total unique file downloads.
        	8b. Daily / Monthly numbers on how many total unique downloads by each file type (Books, iOS Apps, Mac Apps, i/OS upgrades).

        Information that would be of additional value:
        	1. Based on bandwidth currently being served, calculate bandwidth availability (a 1GB Cat 6 cable can only handle so much) and recommend to admin if an additional Caching Server needs to be brought up.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Setup Caching Server
        2. Look at squiggly lines

        Expected Results:
        Much more info.

        Actual Results:
        Nothing currently available.

        Regression:

        Notes:

        Your logs contain much of this information.
