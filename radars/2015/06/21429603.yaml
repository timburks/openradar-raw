    description: Xcode 7.0 seems to do away with the Live Autoresize feature present in previous versions of Xcode (see rdar://21428532). It is useful to be able to resize a view to visualize the way constraints will work at runtime. Currently, the Preview Assistant does not allow resizing the displayed view. It would be nice if it did, including running the auto layout engine to provide a quick way to test and understand the constraints configured in the XIB.
