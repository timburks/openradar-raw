    description: "Summary:\r\nI’d like to be able to use SFSafariViewController but pushed onto the navigation stack rather than as a modal.\r\n\r\nMy use-case is as follows:\r\n\r\nMy app manages a users bookmark (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yummy-for-delicious.com-pinboard.in/id289374576?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lmMT&ct=product).\r\n\r\nIt uses a master-detail structure, where the master is the list of bookmarks and the detail is a web view (currently WKWebView).\r\n\r\nTo use it on the iPhone, I’d have to change the flow which isn’t ideal but would be doable. However, I’m not sure how it would work on the iPad version where both master-detail are visible at the same time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPush a SFSafariViewController onto the navigation stack\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nworks\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo URL bar\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried using child view controllers but without success.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7b1, SImulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
