    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like to be able to rate the songs played on my iPhone from my Apple Watch. \r\nThis would be a perfect use case for Apple Watch since it is a fairly short interaction that would otherwise require you to get the iPhone from your pocket, unlock it, open Music App, rate song, lock it again and put it back in your pocket which is quite cumbersome\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere is no way to rate songs from Apple Watch\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the Music app on Apple Watch there is an option to rate songs (e.g. in a context menu)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to rate songs from Apple Watch\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatch OS 1.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Sport\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
