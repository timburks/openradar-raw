        It would be really nice if the RPScreenRecorder worked in the simulator, so that it could be used for recording bugs and other interactions during development.

        At the very least, RPScreenRecorder should report an error when one tried to start recording on the simulator, to indicate that it failed. Right now, calling startRecordingWithMicrophoneEnabled:handler: will yield a nil error, and the following stopRecordingWithHandler: will be called with both a nil view controller and nil error.
