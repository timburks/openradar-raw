    description: "Summary:\r\nUnlike on Mac, iCloud Photo Library sync can't be paused on iOS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Move to a country where there's no Apple Retail Store\r\n2. Book a vacation\r\n3. Break screen hours before departure\r\n4. Get frustrated because there is no way to get the device replaced before the vacation starts\r\n4. Take an old device out of the drawer\r\n5. Sign in to iCloud account and download a few basics apps\r\n6. Leave home before all photos are downloaded from iCloud\r\n7. Board airplane\r\n8. Connect to airplane WiFi which is limited to, say, 500 MB per passenger\r\n9. WiFi data allowance is used up after a few hours in the air because iOS downloaded photos from iCloud\r\n10. Get frustrated again because you're now disconnected from the internet for the rest of your flight\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nButton in Settings to pause iCloud Photo Library sync\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to pause iCloud Photo Library sync on iOS\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApple sucks at networking\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 64 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
