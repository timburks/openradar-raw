    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting the progress of a UIProgressView doesn't work in iOS 9 using either the \"progress\" property or \"- setProgress:animated:\". No matter what, the progress of the UIProgressView will always be 0.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using Xcode 7 (7A120f), Create a UIProgressView in Storyboard and connect it to code. Deployment target is iOS9.\r\n2. Try to change the UIProgressView's progress by modifying the \"progress\" property or using \"- setProgress:animated:\" in viewDidLoad.\r\n3. Run the project in the iOS 9 simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIProgressView should show the new progress when the view loads. For example, if the code says \"[self.testProgressView setProgress:1.0 animated:YES];\" then the progress view should be completely filled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf \"animated:\" is set to \"NO,\" then the progress view starts at the correct progress when the view loads, but then quickly animates down to 0.0. If \"animated:\" is set to \"YES,\" then the same thing happens, but the progress view itself also incorrectly animates its own size and position.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 (7A120f) running on OS X 10.11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue is not entirely present in iOS 8.3. Setting \"animated:\" to \"YES\" is still somewhat buggy, but setting \"animated:\" to \"NO\" works perfectly in iOS 8.3."
