    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an app crashes in slide over (for example Podcasts rdar://21439356), it will continue to do so whenever you try to show the slide over via edge gesture.\r\n\r\nThere should be a mechanism that removes a crashing app from the slide over panel and replace it with another app, so that the user does not find his slide over not working.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. follow the report instructions from rdar://21439356\r\n2. Notice the crashing of the app and that the slide over panel disappears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- slide over panel should stay visible\r\n- another app or the app selector should display\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- slide over panel disappears\r\n- if you try to show it, the app crashes again, the panel again disappears\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA crashing app should not be able to effectively disable this springboard feature, or else this would frustrate users.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air"
