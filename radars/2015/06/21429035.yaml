    description: "Summary:\r\nIt has been quite a while since iOS first introduced the top and bottom edge gestures, for Notification Center and Control Center. At the time it made sense to have them work how they do: if the app is full screen you get a little tab you need to pull, otherwise the gesture opens Notification Center or Control Center immediately. This was a smart way to ensure the gestures wouldn't interfere with the majority of apps or games that might use similar gestures.\r\n\r\nThis behavior doesn't always make sense though, and I would guess the rules of it aren't obvious to the average user. It's not even entirely clear to meâ€”when a video is playing the little tabs appear even though the status bar is visible. The majority of cases where the little tabs appear are not cases where these gestures do anything else, and pulling on them can often be frustrating.\r\n\r\nI think it would make far more sense to have NC/CC always appear immediately unless an app specifically requests otherwise. Obviously this behavior would have to be tied to a new API, and apps compiled with an older SDK would still get the old behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
