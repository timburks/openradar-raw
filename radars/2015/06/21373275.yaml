        Built-in keyboards on iPad don’t have any indication of which language is selected.

        1. Have two different keyboards on iOS: say, English and Polish
        2. Activate the keyboard on an iPhone → the space bar says “space” in English, “spacja” in Polish, giving an indication of which language I’m using
        3. Try the same thing on iPad

        Expected: The space bar also says “space” in the given language, or there’s some other indication of which language is selected
        Actually: Unlike iPhone, iPad keyboards don’t have this tiny useful affordance.

        In effect, I often make stupid mistakes when I start typing in English, while my keyboard is set to Polish, or vice versa. Auto-correct is playing tricks on me, and I don’t have any visual indication of the language to quickly switch the keyboard before typing.
