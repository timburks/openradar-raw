    description: "After each release of a new iOS Beta version, lots of \"1 star\" review are posted on the App Store with comments like \"Doesn't work on iOS 9\".\r\n\r\nDeliver a quality app, well tested on all existent and supported iOS versions, is difficult. It is also important in order to satisfy the users and get good reviews on the App Store.\r\nSo any bad reviews on the App Store has a strong impact on the app life and on its donwloads and sales. \r\n\r\nIt's not normal that the reputation of an app can be degraded because some people use a beta version of iOS. Beta version are provided for development purpose.\r\nSo people who decide, on their own, to use the beta versions on their main iPhone/iPad should not be able to complain about compatibility issues and should be prevented to post any kind of reviews on the App Store."
