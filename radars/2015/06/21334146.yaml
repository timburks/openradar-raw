    description: "Joe Elliott10-Jun-2015 09:21 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using Siri, you push and hold the home button, and the phone makes a 'de-deep' sound to indicate that Siri is listening.  You can also quickly press the home button to exit Siri, which makes a 'Doop-doop' sound.  On iOS 9, the outro sound is truncated so the last tone is cut off, which results in a 'Doop-d' sound pattern. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I like the more subtle outro sound (I'd rather have siri be really quite and just use a click or tick sound instead) but it seems like a bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Press and hold home to open Siri\r\n2. Quickly press home button to exit Siri\r\n3. Observe sound. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to get the full two-tone sound on outro, as in iOS 8.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get a truncated sound where the second tone of a two-tone sound is partially cut off. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta"
