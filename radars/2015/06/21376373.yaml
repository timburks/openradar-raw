    description: "Summary:\r\nSeveral variants of the new SF UI Text and SF UI Display fonts cause Core Text to draw very choppy underlines. The underlines are thicker, easily colliding with the bowls of various lowercase letters. If the underlined line ends with a “g” or other descending letter, the underline overhangs by a few points, producing an artifact that could easily be mistaken for a period.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet some lowercase English text in SF UI Display Black, SF UI Display Heavy, SF UI Text Heavy, or SF UI Text Heavy Italic. Alternatively, open the attached RTF file, which contains the sample text “momentous occasion steadily approaching”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA solid underline, breaking only for descenders.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA very haphazard underline, breaking also for any bowled letter, such as “a” or “s”. With some non-English text, such as the Vietnamese word “luyện”, this issue can cause entire words to look non-underlined.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe SF UI Display and SF UI Text fonts were downloaded from <https://developer.apple.com/fonts/> on 14 June 2015.\r\n\r\nThis issue is font-specific and doesn’t reproduce in any previous system font.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'momentous occasion steadily approaching.rtf' and 'momentous occasion steadily approaching.png' were successfully uploaded."
