    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be great if we could add subviews that aren't arranged to a UIStackView in Interface Builder as well. This greatly simplifies things like creating a background view for a dynamically sized UIStackView and encourages its use in custom UIView subclasses.\r\n\r\nThe default behaviour could stay the same. However, dragging a UIView in the 'Explicit Subviews' part of the UIStackView in the Object Inspector could add it as a true subview.\r\n\r\nSee attached mockup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 Beta 2 does not support this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'rdarUIStackViewIB.png' was successfully uploaded.
