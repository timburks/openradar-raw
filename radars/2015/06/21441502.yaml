        It would be really useful to have the ability to define a where clause on typealiases in a protocol.


        I would like to be able to have a setup something like the following:

        protocol DataSource {
            typealias ObjectType
        }

        protocol ParentDataSource: DataSource {
            type alias ChildDataSource: DataSource where ChildDataSource.ObjectType == Self.ObjectType
        }

        Such that you could have a tree of data sources, that you could constrain to contain the same object type.
