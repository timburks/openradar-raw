For example: device was on 19% before going to standby, 20 minutes later it was at 13% (even though power save mode was enabled and the device wasn't working on something).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable power save mode\r\n2. Check the battery life from time to time\r\n3. Sometimes you'll notice it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe power save mode should help to conserve the battery life.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't conserve the battery life."
