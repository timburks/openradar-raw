    description: "The problem happens on an iPad that has multiple emails configured, is running iOS 8.3, and is using an MFMailComposerViewController which is set up to present as a Form Sheet (mailViewController.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationFormSheet). \r\n\r\nWhen the user selects the \"From\" field in order to select from the email accounts he has configured on the device a modal view is displayed listing the emails. The problem is that the user has no way to dismiss the dialog... they are effectively stuck (hung) in that state until they restart the application using the MFMailComposerViewController."
