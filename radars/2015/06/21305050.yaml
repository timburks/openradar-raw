    description: "The NSError.setUserInfoValueProviderForDomain() API is incorrectly bridged to Swift 2.0 in Xcode build 7A120f. The return value for the block in this method is bridged as a non-nullable AnyObject, while the Objective-C header states that the return value is explicitly defined as a nullable AnyObject. This prevents me from using this API correctly under Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode build 7A120f on OS X Yosemite build 14D136.\r\n2. Open the playground attached.\r\n3. Note the error message(s).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Swift playground should compile, and nil should be returned successfully from the block when it is called with any key.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe playground does not compile, instead emitting one error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode build 7A120f on OS X build 14A136.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAs far as I can tell, every time this API is used. Hardware: \"MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)\" (as reported by About This Mac)."
