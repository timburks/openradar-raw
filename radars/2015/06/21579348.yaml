    description: "On the session Advanced NSOperation, at WWDC 2015, the speaker makes uses of primitives that are not part of Foundation, but instead are his own creation (which can be found in the sample code here: https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/wwdc/2015/downloads/Advanced-NSOperations.zip). Things like:\r\n\r\n- Operation Observer\r\n- Operation Grouping (composition)\r\n- Mutually Exclusive Operations\r\n- And further enhanced NSOperationQueue (via OperationQueue.swift )\r\n\r\nAll these should be part of the standard library, in order to make it simpler for developers to take advantage of them."
