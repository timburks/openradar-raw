    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a background content download in our iPad App which downloads 6.4GB in around 10 files, each between 500MB and 700MB. If we initiate the download in the foreground and keep the App there, after around 1.2GB the App stops receiving callbacks and seems to hang, however the download continues by the nsurlsessiond until completion without notifying the App. After completion the nsurlsessiond process remains at 100% CPU.\r\n\r\nWhen the App is force terminated by swiping up and then restarted, it will hang and the Watchdog will terminate it. The stacktrace shows that the nsurlsessiond seems to be waiting on a semaphore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse supplied code. Please note that the error will only occur on a setup which is capable of downloading at least 100Mbit/s, this requires an iPad Air 2 AND a fast broadband connection AND a good Wi-Fi AP. In this setup the issue is always reproducible for iOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4 Beta 3. It does NOT happen on iOS 8.2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, 8.4 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2, Fast Broadband Connection and good Wi-Fi Access Point. Speediest should show at least 100 Mbit/s bandwidth\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MPBackgroundDownload.zip' and 'watchdog_crash.txt' were successfully uploaded."
