    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the user selects a contact for \"My Info\" in the Siri settings, then you can ask Siri questions like \"whose phone is this\" and it presents the entire contact. This happens even if you have invoked Siri from the lock screen.\r\n\r\nThis is on the one hand, quite useful. If I've left my iPhone somewhere, than there is a chance that some random person can contact me and return it. On the other hand, presenting the entire contact is too much information.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a way to specify which fields are to be displayed if the phone is locked. For example, just show my name and home phone #, not my address, email, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Settings > General > Siri\r\n2. For \"My Info\", choose a card\r\n3. Now lock the phone\r\n4. Bring up Siri and ask \"whose phone is this\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPre-sepcified information from the \"My Info\" card, e.g. name and home phone, or name and email\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe entire contents of the \"My Info\" card"
