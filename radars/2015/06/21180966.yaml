    description: "Summary:\nWhen an UITextView instance is nested inside larger scrollable UIScrollView that is also zoomed in (zoomScale > 1), the text view doesn’t reliably scroll. Most of the time the parent scroll view grabs the pan gesture and it is scrolled instead. This is not an issue at zoomScale = 1.  \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nExtract the attached archive. Take a look at the included view that show shows the issue. Open the provided example project and follow the on-screen instructions. You might need to try this a few times, but usually it’s simple to reproduce on the device (see video). \n\nExpected Results:\nUITextView scrolling would be prioritized over the parent scroll view. \n\nActual Results:\nMost of the time the parent scroll view scrolls instead of the text view (but not always). \n\nRegression:\niOS 8.3, iPhone and iPad (a bit harder to reproduce on the simulator, but also observable)\n\nNotes:\nThis cause issues in PSPDFKit forms. Also tested with iOS 8.4b3, same result."
