        Summary:
        Spotlight app suggestions for the past 24 hours have continued to recommend apps that I haven't opened in several days. There are many more apps, like Messages, Tweetbot, Mail, Mailbox, and Fantastical, that I use VERY frequently that have never been suggested

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Spotlight. The app suggestions are terrible

        Expected Results:
        I should receive suggestions for apps that I actually use regularly at that time of day, as presented in the keynote.

        Actual Results:
        Spotlight suggests apps that I haven't opened in several days.
