    description: "Currently SFSafariViewController is only suitable for being presented but not pushing into UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nIn a UINavigationController based app, navigating by pushing and popping is more user friendly, especially on large screen iPhones where tapping top right Done button to dismiss is much harder than swiping to pop.\r\n\r\nSFSafariViewController should display URL bar on UINavigationBar when pushed into UINavigationController for it to function well in UINavigationController."
