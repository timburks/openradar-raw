    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 7 enables -Wnullable-to-nonnull-conversion. This produces many warnings in Obj-C which can be silenced with explicit casts to __nonnull, but there are so many that it's difficult and unreadable to do this everywhere.\r\n\r\nLacking better inference and more thorough audits of framework code (namely whether various APIs accept null or would crash), it would be great to have some shorthand for this, like Swift's postfix \"!\".\r\n\r\nThe warning is\r\n\"error: implicit conversion from nullable pointer 'NSString * __nullable' to non-nullable pointer type 'NSString * __nonnull' [-Werror,-Wnullable-to-nonnull-conversion]\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 1"
