    description: "Summary:\nNavigating to Spotlight is sluggish / drops UI frames.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n+ Begin on the first page of apps in Springboard\n+ Pan on Springboard so that roughly half of the first home screen, and half of Spotlight, is visible\n+ Pause in this half-home-screen, half-Spotlight state\n+ Release finger\n\nExpected Results:\nSpringboard either returns to the first home screen, or moves to Spotlight, depending on where the pan was released. It does so in a smooth and fluid manner.\n\nActual Results:\nSpringboard drops frames and stutters for ~0-0.5 seconds, and then performs the expected behavior\n\nRegression:\n+ Occurs on iOS 9 beta 2 on an iPhone 6 Plus. Have not tested on other devices. \n+ Does *not* occur when swiping / panning quickly between the first home screen and Spotlight.\n+ Does *not* occur when performing the same actions, starting at the Spotlight screen\n+ Actually occurs any time any portion, even a tiny portion, or a very large portion, of Spotlight is visible navigating from the first Springboard app screen.\n\nNotes:\nRelated to rdar://21358170 , which describes generally sluggish performance navigating to Spotlight, but rdar://21358170 seems to have been partially solved and performance has generally improved. The problem described in this bug report still exists, though."
