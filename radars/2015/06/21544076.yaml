    description: "When many MKAnnotations are added to an MKMapView they can appear to be overlapping each other and the map can easily become unreadable.\r\nThere are tips and tricks to cluster/de-cluster you MKAnnotations based on current zoom level but they suffer from the following:\r\n1. it's a lot of error-prone code to write, usually involving assigning your MKAnnotations (or the underlying data) to a quad-tree and performing quad-tree search on the fly base on zoom level.\r\n2. even with a good quad-tree the visual treatment is usually very disappointing: the annotations appear clustered at one zoom level and suddenly jump when they de-cluster at a lower zoom level (and vice versa when clustering). Such jumps are the result of adding and removing MKAnnotations from the map: the link is lost between clusters and their content."
