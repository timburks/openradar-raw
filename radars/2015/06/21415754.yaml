        Summary:
        In most situations where an active back button is present, one can return to the previous screen by dragging left to right from the lefthand edge of the display. This gesture does not work for apps opened from search, despite a back button is present in the status bar area.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Search for an app using the new Search screen in iOS 9 (i.e. “Weather”)
        2. Tap one to open it
        3. Drag thumb from the lefthand edge of the display in an attempt to go back to the Search results

        Expected Results:
        Back gesture behaves as expected and slides back to Search screen

        Actual Results:
        No action.

        Regression:


        Notes:
        Conceptually, I understand that this is a difference between going from one app to another rather than screens within a single app. However, the presence of a back button in combination with the sliding animation similar to that of changing screens within one app implies that this gesture should work here, too.
