        Summary:
        An admin should be able to prevent OS X Major Upgrades from displaying on the App Store and all push notifications.

        This could be done via an App Store MobileConfig (preference file) or MDM.

        This should also immediately stop all App Store update notifications that require a new OS X major version as well.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use an older OS.

        Expected Results:
        Not to see the notifications and alerts.

        Actual Results:
        Notifications push user to upgrade.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        We provide upgrade paths once we have vetted the operating system. Having users notified of major upgrades the day of release is detrimental to our business. It can lead to user downtime or the user having incompatible software on their machine.

        Yosemite’s Active Directory issue is a perfect example of why this option needs to be added. With a yearly release cycle, QA is getting worse and worse on Apple’s side.
