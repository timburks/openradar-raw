    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be great if the WWDC app showed the runtimes of videos (or even the ability to filter based on length). There are times when I only have a limited amount of time to watch a WWDC video, and it would be great to be able to select one that will fit in the time I have. Right now, I need to drill down and start the video, just to see how long it is."
