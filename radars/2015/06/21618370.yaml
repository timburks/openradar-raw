    description: "I'd like to get the primary local language (preferably as a NSLocale property on CLPlacemark) for a given geo coordinate as part of the CLGeocoder reverse geocoding API. As a bonus, it could even return an array of languages (sorted by priority) for multi-language regions.\n\nThis would be particularly useful for countries with multiple languages such as Canada, Belgium or Switzerland. \n\nLooking up the language according to country + administrativeArea (or sometimes even subAdministrativeArea) is cumbersome and error-prone so this would be a great addition to CLGeocoder."
