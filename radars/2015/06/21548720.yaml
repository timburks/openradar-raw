        Summary:
        Support for `defer if ` which will call defer block only if the condition are true which including throwing some error

        I think there are some cases which this feature might works for example

        func createGroupFromData(data: T) -> Handler {
        	guard if let queue = dispatch_queue_create() else { throws error }
        	defer if throws error {
        		dispatch_queue_release(queue)
        	}
        	guard if let file = open(fd) else { throws error }
        	defer if throws error {
        		close(fd)
        	}

        	if let handler = data.handlerWithQueue(queue, file: file) {
        		return handler
        	} else {
        		throws error // Call the previous 2 defer blocks only if this error is thrown
        	}
        }

        This is an @schwa â€™s idea and I think it would be very useful in some case.
