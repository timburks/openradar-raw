    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile Xcode is able to link dynamic frameworks that are products of subprojects in the same xcodeproj file as the target, it fails to do so if the frameworks have been precompiled and then added to the project. Hence Xcode does not find the module when trying to import it. \r\nNote that it does not work for any target, neither the testing targets nor the actual app target.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Decompress XcodeLinkingBug\r\n2. Try compile the App.xcodeproj\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Framework.framework is properly linked against the App target and imports successfully. The invocation of the function named \"helloTest\" should not yield an error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe module \"Framework\" is not found. The code does not compile.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\nOSX Yosemite Version 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis does not occur in Xcode Version 6.3.1 (6D1002).\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://github.com/larcus94/Radars/tree/master/21424918"
