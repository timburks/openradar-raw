    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the web process crashes when displaying a WKWebView, the view becomes blank and its URL property is nilled out. While better than crashing the process, this results in a poor user experience and makes it difficult to present a recovery option. The only clean solution I've found is uing KVO on the URL property to detect it being nilled out and present the option to load the page at that URL again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project in Xcode 6.3 (Swift 1.2)\r\n2. Compile and run the app in the iOS Simulator\r\n3. Open Activity Monitor and search for the \"com.apple.WebKit.WebContent\" process.\r\n4. Force-quit the WebContent process. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe web view goes blank and the URL field is nilled out. There is no API method to directly detect this condition.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA delegate callback including the URL should be provided, so the containing application can offer to reload it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 6.3, iOS Simulator running iOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached project uses KVO to detect the URL property going from non-nil to nil, and passes the old value to loadRequest() on the web view. While this works, it feels like a hack and seems like the solution could break in future SDK updates. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WKWebViewCrash.zip' was successfully uploaded."
