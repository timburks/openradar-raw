    description: "Kernel extensions based on the AppleUSBAudioPlugin API (dependent on com.apple.driver.AppleUSBAudio) and using the \"pluginDeviceRequest\" member function, cannot be loaded because the symbol is unresolved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install kernel extension under /Library/Extensions/\r\n2. Load kernel extension with kextutil -t\r\n3. Verify loading with kextstat\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nkextutil should return with a successful exit code (0), and kextstat should list the bundle identifier\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAppleUSBAudioPlugin::pluginDeviceRequest is available on previous versions of OS X and is defined in AppleUSBAudioPlugin.h of the SampleUSBAudioPlugin sample code. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nA code-signed x86_64 build of SampleUSBAudioPlugin (which does not use pluginDeviceRequest) loads on 10.11 without issue. Kexts which use pluginDeviceRequest load without issue on OS X 10.9 and 10.10, but fails to load on 10.11."
