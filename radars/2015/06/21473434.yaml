    description: "Summary:\nIn Notes 4.0 you should be able to hide the notes browser (as you can the folders).\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nCondense the resize handle as much as possible.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe notes browser collapses. Perhaps the list could move in to a popover or panel activate by a toolbar icon.\n\nActual Results:\nThe notes browser condenses down to a minimum of 200px. \n\nRegression:\nNotes.app 4.0\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
