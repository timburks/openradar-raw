    description: "Summary:\r\nI ran into a compiler warning that is very interesting when trying to parse JSON in a test case. I have attached a sample project that demonstrates the behavior. I spoke with the compiler engineers at WWDC15 and they wanted me to file a radar demonstrating the issue.\r\n\r\nHere's the compiler warning that I'm seeing:\r\n\r\nJSONParserTests.swift:26:37: Cast from 'XCUIElement?' to unrelated type '[String : String]' always fails\r\n\r\nI have both the offending line as well as the solution pointed out by one of the Apple engineers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen up the sample project with Xcode 7b1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warning is presented\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe following warning is presented:\r\n\r\nJSONParserTests.swift:26:37: Cast from 'XCUIElement?' to unrelated type '[String : String]' always fails\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 running Xcode 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Swift-2.0-JSON-Parsing.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nYou can also find this sample project on Github at the following link:\r\n- https://github.com/cnoon/Radar-Swift-2.0-JSON-Parsing"
