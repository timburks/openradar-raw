        Summary:

        NSTableViewColumn has a ‘hidden’ property, but it doesn’t expose a binding for this property. This makes it impossible to e.g. configure a user setting to hide/show a given table column using bindings. I’ve needed to implement such a system in Mac apps several time over the years, and every time end up surprised that a hidden binding doesn’t exist, and that I need to drop down to code to set such a thing up.
