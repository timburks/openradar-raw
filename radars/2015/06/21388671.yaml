        Summary:
        Typing a URL into the Safari just reloads the current page instead of going to the new URL.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to any URL, like say, http://theverge.com
        2. Tap on a link on that page to visit another page
        3. Go to the URL bar, and type “http://www.slashdot.org”

        Expected Results:
        Expect Safari to load http://www.slashdot.org

        Actual Results:
        The current page is reloaded.

        Regression:
        iOS 9 Beta 1.

        Notes:
        It seems that if you immediately type the URL _again_, then Safari goes to the correct page. But you always have to type it twice.
