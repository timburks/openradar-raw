        Summary:
        SFSafariViewController should have a `barTintColor` in addition to `tintColor`. Right now, SFSafariViewController is always white, which isn’t ideal for apps that aren’t white (in particular, apps with a dark color scheme). The addition of `barTintColor` would be hugely beneficial in terms of allowing apps to provide a more branded, cohesive experience.

        SFSafariViewController’s `barTintColor` would function just like the `barTintColor` property on UINavigationBar, UITabBar, and UIToolbar does. When SFSafariViewController’s `barTintColor` is set, it would apply to both the top bar (search, etc.) as well as the bottom toolbar.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to change the background color of SFSafariViewController’s bars to be anything other than white.

        Expected Results:
        SFSafariViewController should have a `barTintColor` property that allows applications to change it’s bars’ background color.

        Actual Results:
        You can’t change SFSafariViewController’s bar background color because there aren’t currently any APIs for this.

        Regression:
        N/A
