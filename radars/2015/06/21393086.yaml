        Summary:
        The provisioning profiles sheet that is accessible through the Devices window is unusable for it’s primary purposes: listing, adding and removing provisioning profiles on attached devices. This makes it impossible to work around issues with enterprise In-House or (presumably) Ad-Hoc distribution builds when Xcode fails to embed the provisioning profiles into the resulting .ipa file.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the Devices window in Xcode using the Window > Devices menu entry
        2. Connect a device
        3. Right-click the device and select “Show Provisioning Profiles…”
        4. The provisioning profiles sheet appears

        Expected Results:
        The provisioning profiles sheet will list any and all provisioning profiles currently installed on the device

        Actual Results:
        The provisioning profiles sheet is always empty. This is true even after using the + button, browsing for a profile and adding it to the device.

        Regression:
        This issue is the same on Xcode 6.3.2, 6.4 beta 4 (6E31c) and 7 beta 1 (7A120f)
