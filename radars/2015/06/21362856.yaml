    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom time to time Xcode can't find the ModuleName-Swift.h file, which allows bridging from Swift to Objective-C. This is pretty serious and should be fixed asap. \r\n\r\nWhen Xcode doesn't find the header it just says \"Header file not found\" or even throws a linking error. The entire bridging process should be improved simply because there is still a lot of potential.\r\n\r\nI asked a Swift engineer at WWDC in a lab and even he didn't know how to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a ramdom Swift class to an Objective-C project\r\n2. Add the #import \"ModuleName-Swift.h\" file that Xcode generates automatically\r\n3. Try to use it or just try to compile the project\r\n4. From time to time it simply doesn't work\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBridging should be reliable and easy to encourage users to use swift and Objective-C.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBridging is painful and makes me want to stick with Objective-C."
