    description: "Summary:\r\n+defaultTestSuite should get called before an XCTestCase get's run to give the test the opportunity to add tests dynamically.\r\n\r\nThis works fine when running all tests (Product -> Test, or Command+U) but in Xcode 7 it does +defaultTestSuite does no longer get called when the test in ran from either the test navigator or the using the little \"play\" button in the code editor next to the test. (For both the test function and the test class)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install XCode\r\n2. Unpack and open the attached project\r\n3. Go to the \"Test Navigator\" and run \"DemoProjectTests\" (Do not use command+u or Product->Test)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe demo unit test passes because defaultTestSuiteCalled should be set to true when +defaultTestSuite was called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n+ defaultTestSuite does not get called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 7.0 Beta (7A120f)\r\nOSX: 10.11 (15A178w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DemoProject.zip' was successfully uploaded."
