        Summary:
        Safari frequently fails to load URLs that redirect. I notice this a lot with Twitter’s short domain (t.co) e.g. https://t.co/kd5pGWOnFR … however it happens with other domains too which leads me to believe it’s a bug in Safari. Some casual testing with problematic URLs in other browsers supports this suspicion.

        After a redirected URL has been successfully loaded once it seems to always load reliably after that.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a short URL from a twitter app, or any other redirected URL
        2. See if Safari loads it or not.
        3. If not then reload until it works.

        Expected Results:
        Safari should load redirected URLs the first time, every time.

        Actual Results:
        Sometimes Safari fails to load the URL.

        Regression:
        I’m testing this on the OS X 10.11 beta 15A178w on a Retina 5k iMac. I *think* I saw it on 10.11 on my MacBook Pro too, but am not certain about that.
