    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPad supports three new multitasking styles. While it could be argued that Slide Over and Split View modes make little sense on a screen the size of an iPhone, the Picture in Picture mode seems like it would still be very useful.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone is every bit as powerful as the models of iPad that support Picture in Picture.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Watch a video in an app on an iPhone running iOS 9\r\n2. Press the home button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe video should continue playing, and shrink down to a small draggable thumbnail, as it does on iPad.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo stops playing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, Beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
