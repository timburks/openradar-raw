        I believe the bug I am reporting has already been filed under rdar://21143551
        Confirmed still exists in Xcode 6.3.2. Cannot test on Xcode 7 due to Swift 2 requirement.
        Causes one of my Playgrounds to not work. My backtrace is attached.

        Original bug:

        Summary:

        Thereâ€™s a segfault when calling toString() on the valueType received from reflection

        Steps to Reproduce:
        let reflection = reflect(object)

                    for i in 0..<reflection.count {
                            let propertyMirror = reflection[i].1
                            let propertyValueType = propertyMirror.valueType
                            let typeName = toString(propertyValueType)
                    }

        Expected Results:
        typeName should contain a valid string representation of the type name

        Actual Results:
        See attached backtrace
