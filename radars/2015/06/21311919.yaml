    description: "Summary:\r\nI love that I can access Spotlight by swiping down from any screen on my home screen. I'm glad that this feature has not been removed in iOS 9 with the addition of Proactive Spotlight, but I'd love for Spotlight when swiping down to be the same experience as the leftmost screen.\r\n\r\nI have very bad carpal tunnel and RSI in my hands. My iPhone is already a little painful to use on a regular basis. Having to swipe across several screens to get to Spotlight is just not doable for me. Please consider this enhancement!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Spotlight experience when swiping down from any home screen should be the same as the leftmost screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can only search in Spotlight when swiping down; there are no proactive features."
