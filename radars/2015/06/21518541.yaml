    description: "Summary:\r\nStoage used by Time Machine local backups is not represented well. Disk space is used by Time Machine in .MobileBackups, but that space is not presented in the Info dialog for a volume, nor in About This Mac, nor in the new Disk Utility.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnable Time Machine and notice the free space of your boot volume is reduced by a large amount. In my case, 38-61GB.  Amount of space is reported via:\r\n\r\nsudo du -c -d1 -h /.MobileBackups/\r\n\r\n 38G\t/.MobileBackups//Computer\r\n 38G\t/.MobileBackups/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the operating system is going to use space, it should report it in some manner other than \"Other\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee several hundred gigabytes in \"other\" in About This Mac storage, or in Disk Utility.  Cannot easily determine what is using space on my computer."
