    description: "Because a human is basically a drooling positive reinforcement driven Pavlovian dog when it comes to exercise, when working out I would love to have positive feedback when I have completed a target time / distance / calorie count in the workout app.\r\n\r\nCurrently feedback is given when I complete the workout or when a daily activity goal is met, but I would also like to have at least a brief tap when the target I set has been reached. This would be helpful also in workouts where you are specifically asked to complete a certain time / distance before moving onto a subsequent step."
