        Summary:

        On first use of the watchOS weather app after upgrading the watch to 2.0 and my iPhone 5 to iOS 9, it initially displayed an empty weather forecast for “South Atlantic…”, when in fact my location was Guildford, UK. Eventually the display was updated with my real location and the weather forecast.

        I’m guessing that the watch app did a geocode lookup on an unitialised latitude/longitude of 0.0, 0.0, which would be in the south Atlantic.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Do a clean install of watchOS and iOS 9
        2. Launch the weather app
        3. Observe location description is “South atlantic”
        4. Observe weather forecast is blank
        5. Observe both location description and weather forecast are eventually displayed

        Expected Results:

        I would expect a blank weather forecast and no location description to be displayed until a true location had been found.

        Actual Results:

        Incorrect location description.

        Regression:
