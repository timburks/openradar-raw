        When WWDC session slides contain snippets of code, theyâ€™re almost always just white text on dark background.

        This is difficult to parse for humans.

        Code snippets on slides should have colored syntax, like you would do in a text editor.

        (Pro-Tip: You can copy snippets of code from Xcode, and when you paste them to Keynote, the code retains its highlighting. So you could just have a consistent Xcode theme for WWDC slide purposes, and use it that way.)
