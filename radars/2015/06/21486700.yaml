        Summary:
        Applications downloaded from Apple Configurator 2 will respect El Capitan Caching Server, but iOS updates are still downloaded directly from Apple.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Setup El Capitan Caching Server
        2. Configure Apple Configurator 2
        3. Attempt to upgrade iOS device

        Expected Results:
        iOS firmware files should download from the Caching Server. If they are not available, it should ping the Caching Server to download them for future Apple Configurator 2 devices.

        Actual Results:
        iOS firmware files are pulled directly from Appleâ€™s servers.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
