        Summary:
        Trying to cut down on a huge bunch of bursts from a recent trip, I was processing bursts into single selection images, one at a time. Sometimes, they weren’t the first in the list. As I finished with a burst and it was removed from the bursts album, most of the time (but not all of the time - occasionally it worked as expected), the very first burst was navigated to as the next burst.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Take several burst photos
        2. Open iPhoto on the Mac
        3. Navigate to Albums>Bursts
        4. Open a burst around the middle of the lot
        5. Select a single image from the burst
        6. Click done
        7. Click “Keep selection only”

        Expected Results:
        1. Burst will disappear
        2. Next or prior burst will appear

        Actual Results:
        1. Burst disappears
        2. Very first burst appears

        Regression:
        Occasionally (one in ten?), the next/prior burst appears as expected.
