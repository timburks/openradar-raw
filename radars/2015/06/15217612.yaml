    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to resize any window in OS X to the full bounds of the screen, the left/right bounds of the window are seemingly adjusted with an offset from the cursor origin to the point in the \"resizing section\" where the resize was initiated as opposed to adjusting with the actual cursor origin.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any window.\r\n2. Attempt to resize the window from the outer bounds of the window's resizing sections on either the right or left side of the window to the full right or left bounds of the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window's bounds should be adjusted with respect to the cursor\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window's bounds are instead adjusted with an offset from the cursor, dependent on the point in the window's resizing section at which the resizing originated. A small gap with a width equal to that offset is left between the bounds of the window and the bounds of the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9/13A598\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only way to close the gap issue is to either initiate the resize from the inner bounds of the window's resizing section, or resize again but drag in the opposite direction first and then finally in the direction of the screen bounds. A video is attached as an example for both the issue and the only way to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'resizing.mov' was successfully uploaded."
