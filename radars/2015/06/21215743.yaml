        Summary:
        Sometimes, when I receive an email on my FastMail’s IMAP account, Mail.app does not raise a notification about that. Only when I actively open (the already listed) message, the Notification shows up.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a

        Expected Results:
        The notification should appear the moment the message arrives.

        Actual Results:
        As stated above.

        Regression:
        This happens at least on my late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina (15”) running 10.10.3.
