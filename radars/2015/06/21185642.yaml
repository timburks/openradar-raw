    description: "Summary:\r\nI keep my iPhone 6 in my pocket along with my wallet, which contains the security ID I use for unlocking the door at my office. The reader is at pocket height, and I’ve always bumped my pocket against the reader to unlock the door (especially handy when my hands are full).\r\n\r\nOnce I added cards to Apple Pay on my iPhone 6, though, Apple Pay often shows up while I’m unlocking the door, and never goes away until I take my phone out to dismiss it. Until then, for however long my phone stays in my pocket, the screen is on, burning through my battery.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configured Apple Pay on an iPhone 6\r\n2. Hold it within range of a non-payment NFC reader\r\n3. Leave the phone alone for 5 minuets\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone locks itself up again, so the screen is off and not consuming battery\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Apple Pay interface stays active indefinitely, until it’s manually closed, even an hour later. There should be some sort of timeout, in case of accidental activation. This could even be a potential security flow, if you leave your finger on Touch ID in your pocket, not knowing Apple Pay is active."
