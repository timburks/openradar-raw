    description: "The majority of times I use a guard statement, it's to return early from a function if the condition isn't met. Instead of always writing this:\r\n\r\nguard someCondition else { return }\r\n\r\nguard should have return as default behavior if no else clause is specified. So this would result in a return from the function:\r\n\r\nguard someCondition"
