        I'm the CTO at Lookback, a tool that records an iPhone's screen, camera, microphone and many other data sources, for doing video bug reports, user experience research studies, demo videos, and so on. In rdar://20262995, I requested a screen recording API, and RPScreenRecorder is really close to what we need. For this, I thank you profusely!

        RPScreenRecorder requires you to present a RPPreviewViewController after recording. Lookback already has a PreviewViewController, to allow the user to discard the video in case they don't want to share it, which also plays back all the other recorded data (such as camera, touches, view names, and so on). Showing two preview screens after each other would be a terrible experience, and using the Activity UI to forward the video to Lookback is a very awkward interaction. In short: we would like to use the RPScreenRecorder without RPPreviewViewController and get the video data directly.

        Getting an m4v file would be nice. Even better would be to get CVSampleBufferRefs for the individual frames as they are being recorded, either as h264 buffers, or raw YpCbCr pixel data. The reason for this is because Lookback can be used to record the user experience all the way up until a crash of the app, which means that muxing must be done as a post-processing step or you just end up with a broken m4v file.

        Again, thank you for providing this API!
