    description: "Summary:\r\nUI testing in Xcode 7 does not give us access to the actual view hierarchy of the tested app. XCUIElement does only give us access to the most basic properties like 'frame' and whether it exists. This renders it useless for more advanced tests or even simple tests with controls other than UILabel.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a little app with a UIButton. Add different images for the various UIControlStates\r\n2. Write a UI test that taps the button to make it selected/highlighted etc.\r\n3. Try to test the current image displayed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccess to the UIButton so one can call -currentImage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccess to XCUIElement that only gives us basic information\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta (7A120f)"
