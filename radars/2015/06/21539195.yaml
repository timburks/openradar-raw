    description: "Summary:\r\nThe device restarts whenever I try to clear a particular notification that a person accepted my calendar invite.  I have tried clearing it from the iOS notification center (clear all today's), from the lock screen (Swipe left and tap the x), and by swiping it right and entering the calendar app. \r\n\r\nThe notification also repeatedly activates (phone vibrates, banner alert, etc) even though it has already been received.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Invite someone to a calendar invite.\r\n2. Have that person accept the calendar invite.\r\n3. You will receive a notification of the calendar invite on your lock screen.\r\n4. Swipe left and tap the x to clear it, and the device restarts. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the notification to clear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device restarts and the notification remains in the iOS notification center and on the lock screen.  Occasionally the phone will vibrate multiple times to alert me to the same notification."
