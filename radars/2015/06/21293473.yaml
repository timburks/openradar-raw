        Summary:
        In Swift 1.2, an enum could conform to a protocol with typealiases shadowing the names of its cases. This worked out just fine in practice because they could never actually collide; the types were available in constraints and the cases were available when constructing instances of the type.

        Swift 2 has regressed this, erroring out with unhelpful (bogus) paths.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Compile this code:

        protocol EitherType {
        	typealias Left
        	typealias Right

        	func either<V>(ifLeft ifLeft: Left -> V, ifRight: Right -> V) -> V
        }

        enum Either<T, U>: EitherType {
        	case Left(T)
        	case Right(U)

        	func either<V>(ifLeft ifLeft: T -> V, ifRight: U -> V) -> V {
        		switch self {
        		case let .Left(left):
        			return ifLeft(left)
        		case let .Right(right):
        			return ifRight(right)
        		}
        	}
        }



        Expected Results:
        Success.


        Actual Results:
        Bad errors:

        either.Either:5:13: error: invalid redeclaration of 'Left'
          typealias Left = T
                    ^
        ./either.swift:11:7: note: 'Left' previously declared here
                case Left(T)
                     ^
        either.Either:6:13: error: invalid redeclaration of 'Right'
          typealias Right = U
                    ^
        ./either.swift:12:7: note: 'Right' previously declared here
                case Right(U)
                     ^

        NB: the errors themselves state that the redeclaration is in either.Either, which isn’t actually a Swift source file. Xcode therefore can’t show me the source which the errors reference, which is the icing on the cake.


        Regression:
        This compiled fine in Swift 1.2 (modulo the intrusion of Box or equivalent).
