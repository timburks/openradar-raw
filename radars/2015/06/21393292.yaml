        Summary:
        WWDC session numbers make are an easy way to uniquely identify sessions. They are only three digits and make it easy to quickly reference a distinct session in discussions and notes.

        I suggest making these number much more prominent by always presenting them with the title on ALL channels as well as showing the session number on every slide of the presentation.

        Three numbers take up hardly any space and can especially help to identify sessions when real estate is constrained (like on iPhone and Apple Watch). Even a watermark in the corner would be great.
