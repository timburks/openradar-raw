    description: "Summary:\r\nRepeated runs of a physics simulation using the Sprite Kit physics API give different results despite identical initial conditions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple physics simulation involving many falling blocks, balls, etc.\r\n2. Run the simulation repeatedly using identical initial conditions.\r\n3. Compare final screen shots from each run which show different final positions for simulation objects.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRepeated runs of a physics simulation with identical initial conditions should always produce the same final output.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEach run of the simulation produces noticeably different results. The more objects involved, the greater the difference."
