        Summary:
        Apps which make use of HealthKit characteristic data such as Date of Birth and Gender cannot write out these values, they can only be read. If the user hasn’t entered this data into the Health app or the Medical ID sheet the values will be empty, even if they give this data to the app.

        I’d like to see a way for apps to either (a) launch the Health app to the “Me” screen or (b) bring up an in-app sheet (like the Medical ID edit sheet). The intent is to make it easier to enter any missing Health characteristic data if they want.

        Our current options are to either provide a set of instructions for how to find where this data can be entered (which they won’t read) or to ignore HealthKit and keep these values locally within our app. This second option doesn’t help other HealthKit apps which use the same data.
