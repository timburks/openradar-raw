    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a UIImageView, you can make it a larger size than the UIImage it contains. However, selecting someImageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeCenter will cause the image to be blurry because its origin contains a fractional pixel.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a UIImageView bug or a UIView bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI attached a project with sample code, but here is the important part:\r\n\r\niconImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"foo.png\"]];\r\niconImageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeCenter;\r\n// Add 1 px (which is a fractional point on retina devices) to the image view's height. The image view will try to leave 0.5 px of blank space on the top and bottom, causing the blurry icon.\r\niconImageView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, iconImageView.frame.size.width, iconImageView.frame.size.height + 1 / [UIScreen mainScreen].scale);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image is as close to centered as possible, within the constraint of snapping it to the pixel grid\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen calculating the image's coordinates, UIKit doesn't seem to round to the pixel grid.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8, all versions. iOS 9 beta 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis behavior does not happen on iOS 7\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nPhysical device and simulators: iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIImageViewBlurryBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0K3b38392m1i"
