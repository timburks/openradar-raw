    description: "The entire do-try-catch pattern is really cumbersome. It promotes error handling code that is far away from the code and generic error handling. \n\nIt would be much nicer to write error handling code like this:\n\ntry f() catch { /* error handling code */ }\n\nMerging this with guard is natural as well:\n\nguard let r = f() catch { /* scope exiting error handling code */ }\n\nA further write up is here: http://owensd.io/2015/06/16/do-catch.html"
