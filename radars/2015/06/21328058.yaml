    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen recording for a UI Test, tapping on a UILabel with multiple lines of text produces non-functional code, which doesn't compile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open project.\r\n2. Navigate to UITestingRecordingWithLabelUITests.swift\r\n3. Record a new test. \r\n4. In Simulator, tap on the label with the 'Lorem Ipsumâ€¦' text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne line of code that simulates a tap on the label should be produced. Code still compiles.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMultiple lines of code are produced (see screenshot), most of which have no effect, and cause compiler errors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UITestingRecordingWithLabel.zip' was successfully uploaded."
