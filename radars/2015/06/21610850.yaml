        Summary:
        According to the documentation for MKAnnotationView, the “centerOffset” is in pixels. In practice, it’s in points.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an MKMapView and add several annotations to it.
        2. In the delegate callback, create an MKAnnotationView for each annotation with an image.
        3. Set the center offset to {0, -(imageHeightInPixels / 2)} to place the annotation view’s bottom center at the annotation’s location on the map.
        4. Zoom the map in and out.

        Expected Results:
        The annotation views will remain anchored to their locations.

        Actual Results:
        Because the image height was specified in pixels, not points, on Retina displays the annotations will move around unexpectedly.
