        Summary:
        The provided code, which improperly overloads an identifier, causes the compiler to trap.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. create a new framework project.
        2. add the following code to the project in a swift file

        public struct Foo {
            typealias Hello = String
            public let apply:(Hello) -> Int
            public func apply(input:Hello) -> Int {
                return apply(input)
            }
        }

        3. Observe crash

        Expected Results:
        No crash and a compile error pointing out the mistake of overloading in this manner.

        Actual Results:
        Command failed due to signal: Abort trap: 6

        Regression:
        This code built with 6.4 without error or compiler crash.

        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
