    description: "Summary:\r\nBuilding iOS apps using xcodebuild has a known issue where the watch app entitlements and/or provisioning aren’t set up correctly in the resulting .ipa file. This results in numerous entitlements errors when attempting to submit these .ipa files to iTunes Connect through the Application Loader.\r\n\r\nAt WWDC15 I was told there will be a new way to specify helpful information to xcodebuild so that it can figure these things out and that there will be a new “exportWithOptions” option for xcodebuild, which takes a path to a plist file. The initial Xcode 7 seed doesn’t include any information about this so I’m unable to test it to verify whether this functionality works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Terminal, run xcodebuild -help\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe help output will include details about the new exportWithOptions argument\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe help output does not include any information about the exportWithOptions argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\nXcode 7.0\r\nBuild version 7A120f\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nrdar://20898925\r\nrdar://16703091\r\nrdar://20468156"
