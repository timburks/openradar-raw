    description: |-
        In Polish, it’s customary to call the ⏎ key “enter”, not “return”. If you say to someone “the return key” in Polish, even a computer nerd, they won’t get it. It’s just called “enter”.

        Therefore, iOS keyboard should reflect that and have the ⏎ key be labeled “enter” on the Polish keyboard (and, likely, some others)
