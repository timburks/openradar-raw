    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new SF UI Text and SF UI Display fonts are refreshingly legible for most Vietnamese text. However, there are a few cases where SF UI remains less legible than Lucida Grande or even Helvetica Neue, which was particularly problematic in this language.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached RTF document and screenshot for the following issues:\r\n\r\nA. SF UI Text, SF UI Display, and Helvetica Neue all run “đ” and “ĩ” together and “đ” and “ì” together. The examples in the document appear frequently in Vietnamese localizations: “đĩa” (disk) and “đình” (delay). The effect is particularly bad in SF UI Display Ultralight and Helvetica Neue Ultralight.\r\n\r\nĂ. Due to the relatively ungenerous keming afforded to the lowercase letters “l” and “i”, the word “lì” (as in “lì xì”, New Year’s red envelope) collapses into quite an enigma. The ` attaches to the l, appearing to be a dead pixel rather than a diacritic on ı. A little more space, please. (In traditional Vietnamese typography and handwriting, one leaves the tittle on the i and places the diacritic atop the tittle, avoiding this collision. However, these fonts must accommodate other languages in which that would be absurd.)\r\n\r\nÂ. As discussed in <rdar://problem/21376373>, underlines are a mess in some variations of SF UI. But the dot below diacritic in Vietnamese appears to exacerbate the problem where it didn’t in Helvetica Neue or Lucida Grande.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3 (14D136)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'đĩa đình lì luyện.rtf' and 'đĩa đình lì luyện.png' were successfully uploaded."
