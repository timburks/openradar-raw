    description: "The layout of boarding passes has been designed with air travel in mind, where all the departure and arrivals can be displayed with three-letters codes, like “SFO” or “JFK”. For train travel, especially in continental Europe, this doesn’t work: such short codes simply don’t exist. The consequence is that in Passbook, train station names are very often truncated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(See attached screenshots for reference and alternative designs)\r\n\r\nSetup a pkpass for train travel in Europe. As recommended, use the primary fields for departure and arrival.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStation names are displayed prominently on the boarding pass.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStation names are truncated, even not particularly long ones. Additionally, passbook tries to use a smaller font, making the most important information very small, but even then, it just doesn’t fit.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMost train stations names are too large to fit in half a screen. We’ve worked on that specific design issue a lot on Capitaine Train (https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/capitaine-train-achat-billets/id599502670?mt=8) : you can view example of an “origin-destination” cell on the last two screenshots of the store. Basically, two station names will never fit on a single line of text.\r\n\r\nAttached are two screenshots:\r\n* boardingPass.png is setup as an actual \"PKTransitTypeTrain\" \"boardingPass\" .pkpass, using the primary fields as intended, for departure and destination;\r\n* generic.png isn’t a boarding pass but a \"generic\" pkpass, and uses a single primaryField with a newline to display the journey. This is not yet ideal, but at least, the station names are visible in full.\r\n\r\n(We can’t actually use \"generic\" passes, because they do not appear on the lock screen.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis isn’t new to iOS 9: the current design of passbook dates from the iOS7, but the layout hasn’t really changed since the beginning of Passbook.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'boardingPass.png' and 'generic.png' were successfully uploaded."
