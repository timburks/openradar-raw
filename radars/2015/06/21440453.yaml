    description: "When dismissing the PKAddPassesViewController in the delegate addPassesViewControllerDidFinish method, the view controller disappears abruptly, without fading out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached minimal project. The three button present a PKAddPassesViewController with a different delegate: \r\n\r\n1. addPassesViewControllerDidFinish is unimplemented\r\n2. addPassesViewControllerDidFinish is empty\r\n3. addPassesViewControllerDidFinish dismisses the PKAddPassesViewController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn cases 1. and 2., I’m not sure what should happen. The documentation states that addPassesViewControllerDidFinish is optional, but that the implementation should dismiss presentation.\r\nIn case 3. the PKAddPassesViewController should disappear with an animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. the PKAddPassesViewController fades out\r\n2. the PKAddPassesViewController never disappears\r\n3. the PKAddPassesViewController is dismissed abruptly without fading out\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4254u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not a new bug: this was already the case in iOS 8 and possibly before.\r\n\r\nThe problem I’m reporting is about case 3, where there should be an animation. There is also arguably a documentation issue to explain what the expected behavior should be in case 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestPKPassesAddition.zip' was successfully uploaded. http://cl.ly/1R0l3n3g3y3Q/download/TestPKPassesAddition.zip"
