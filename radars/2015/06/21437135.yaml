        Summary:
        I tried to install OSX El Capitan Beta1 Developer preview. The install tells me that my hdd is encrypted and file vault didn’t finish the process or something like that and suggests to disable file vault encryption. After that I’m prompted with a restart button, I restart and the El Capitan setup starts again, and again. I have to manually choose to boot from Yosemite (cmd R).
        After this, when in Yosemite (10.10.3) I try to disable file vault. It says 2 hours. I want until it finishes. Just after it was finishing, it said: “Encryption Paused”. I tried to restart the mac, repair disk, repair disk permissions, reset NVRAM etc. Nothing worked. Also, sometimes it crashes when I toggle between the tabs in Security&Privacy from Settings.
        I also tried to reinstall Yosemite but that also didn’t work and complained about the disk being encrypted an couldn’t do that also.
        I have a lot of friends at work who have the same problem. I’ve read a post somewhere on the internet about a person going to WWDC2015 and asking a developer about this problem - the developer said that’s this issue is addressed in 10.10.3. It doesn’t work for me :(.

        This is my setup:
          Model Name:	MacBook Pro
          Model Identifier:	MacBookPro11,3
          Processor Name:	Intel Core i7
          Processor Speed:	2.5 GHz
          Number of Processors:	1
          Total Number of Cores:	4
          L2 Cache (per Core):	256 KB
          L3 Cache:	6 MB
          Memory:	16 GB
          Boot ROM Version:	MBP112.0138.B14
          SMC Version (system):	2.19f12


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Settings > Security&Privacy > File Vault - can’t turn off file vault encryption.

        Expected Results:
        Disable FileVault encryption and install El Capitan to help you guys.

        Actual Results:
        FileVault hangs, crashes the Settings app and I can’t disable FileVault encryption.
