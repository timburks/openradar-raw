    description: "Summary:\r\nSince 10.10, the \"delay\" command doesn't seem to work in standalong applescript apps any more. It still does work in the Script Editor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing the Script Editor, write this code and run it in the editor:\r\n\r\nbeep\r\ndelay 2\r\nbeep\r\n\r\nNote that the app runs for about 2 seconds, with a beep at the start and at its end.\r\n\r\nNow save this as an application and launch the app under 10.10.3\r\nNote that the app quits immediately. It should, however, keep running for about 2 seconds before quitting and beeping. This suggests that the delay is ending prematurely.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/161749/applescript-delay-not-working-since-switch-to-yosemite\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac Pro (Early 2008)\r\n2 x 2,8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon\r\n8GB RAM"
