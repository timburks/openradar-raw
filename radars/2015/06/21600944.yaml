    description: |-
        Ever since I installed beta 2, Time Machine can’t complete a backup, claiming that it unexpectedly runs out of space. Also, while it’s backing up, the amount that needs to be backed up continuously increases, leading me to think it’s actually in some sort of an infinite backup loop.

        The real downside is it claims it will fix this next time by erasing some older backups. If it actually is doing this each time (erasing older backups / failing), then I imagine it would eventually totally erase all backups?
