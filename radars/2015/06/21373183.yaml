        1. Open some app on iPad
        2. Double tap the home button to see what app is to the left/right of the current app (what’s the previous/next app)
        3. Go back to the app
        4. Now swipe left or right with 4 fingers

        expected: swipes to the last app — to the same app as you can see in the app switcher
        actual: ??? Random app? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
