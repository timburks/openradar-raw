    description: "Summary:\r\nPer the discussion in WWDC Session 703 (\"Privacy and Your Apps\"), iOS 9 has added new controls to limit the use of the [UIApplication canOpenURL] method to detect the presence of other apps on a device.\r\n\r\nThe new system using the LSApplicationQueriesSchemes array in the app's Info.plist to whitelist allowed URL schemes is also being applied to the [UIApplication openURL] method.  If URLs with schemes not explicitly declared in the plist are called, the same system log entries are made as those of \"canOpenURL\" and openURL fails silently.\r\n\r\nI believe \"openURL\" should continue to function on any URL.\r\n\r\nThe stated goal of preventing app detection using \"canOpenURL\" can still be acheived without limiting the functionality of \"openURL\". The user experience for users of apps wishing to open arbitrary URLs may be decreased without a way to detect certain other apps, but since \"openURL\" will always open the other app, it can not be exploited in the same way as \"canOpenURL\" to scan user systems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- call [UIApplication openURL] with a URL based on a scheme not declared in LSApplicationQueriesSchemes, but which can be handled by an app installed on the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- URL will be opened by system. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- [UIApplication openURL] call fails silently.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
