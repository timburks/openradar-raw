        Summary:
        After I restart my Mac, Safari loses many cookies, requiring me to sign in repeatedly, even when the sites offer to remember my credentials

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Sign into a site, telling it to remember you (e.g. http://pulllist.comixologycom, http://www.chase.com)
        2. Close the browser window
        3. Restart OS X
        4. Open a new browser window for the site

        Expected Results:
        The site remembers you (e.g. Comixology shows your pull list, or Chase doesn’t require you to authenticate your computer)

        Actual Results:
        Comixology requires me to sign in again, and Chase requires a verification code be sent, even though this is the computer I’ve always used and have told the site to remember it
