    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are already a large number of gestures that involve swiping in from the right edge: swiping through a gallery of photos, swiping forward in Safari, just moving around a web page, flipping pages in iBooks, and so on. Most of these don't have to be done from the edge, but it's natural to do soâ€”it allows me to make the gesture with the least effort possible. If you're flipping through a photo gallery or book, it should be as effortless as possible.\r\n\r\nBecause of this I have been accidentally opening Slide Over frequently. If you swipe in just the right spot, it opens immediately without the little tab popping up first, and for me that spot is exactly where my thumb lands if I hold my iPad in the most comfortable way. Even if the tab did appear I would expect to trigger it nearly as often from quickly flipping through photos or pages. As a result I've had to start holding my iPad in more awkward ways.\r\n\r\nI don't want to turn the gesture off. I would like the feature to be easily available when I need it. To me, something like a two finger swipe, or even just a button on the multitasking screen (when you double-press the home button) would make much more sense.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Hold iPad comfortably in right hand\r\n2. Swipe through photos or other content using your thumb\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSlide Over should not appear\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSlide Over often opens\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 (13A4254v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2, Wi-Fi, 128GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
