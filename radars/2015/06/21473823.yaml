    description: "Summary:\r\nThe cells displayed in `UICollectionView` are not removed from it after calling `-[UICollectionView reloadSections:]`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse this gist to reproduce this bug: https://gist.github.com/crazytonyli/2b340ca9b49143366938\r\n\r\n1. Put the `ViewController.m` file into an iOS Xcode project.\r\n2. Create an instance of `ViewController` and present it.\r\n3. Run the iOS demo project, present `ViewController`.\r\n3. Checkout the console log.\r\n4. After the 'reload' log is shown, use Xcode's Debug View Hierarchy tool to checkout UICollectionView's subviews. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cells count should be same before and after `reloadSections` message is sent.\r\nNumber of cells in `UICollectionView` instance should not be greater than the number of items in section 0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf run the demo project in iPhone 6 Simulator, the console output will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncells: 4\r\nreload\r\ncells: 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse Debug View Hierarchy tool to checkout `UICollectionView`'s subviews, we will see 8 cells, but we should only have 5 items for section 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 6 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-06-20 at 7.43.20 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
