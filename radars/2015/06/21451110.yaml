    description: Please provide a static analysis tool that mimics the App Store binary ingestion process. This will help developers identify issues with their apps prior to submitting them for review. For example, if the app declares an entitlement that it does not actually use, the app will be rejected. However, a static analysis or API scanning tool should be able to find this so the developer can disable that unused entitlement.
