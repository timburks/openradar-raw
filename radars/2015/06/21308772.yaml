    description: "Summary:\r\nEl Capitan.jpg in /Library/Desktop Pictures is locked and cannot be modified.\r\n\r\nThis will allow an admin to change the default picture, now that /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg is blocked from modification due to SIP.\r\n\r\n/Library/Desktop Pictures itself is not blocked, but try modifying /Library/Desktop Pictures/El Capitan.jpg, which is what /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg points to.\r\n \r\nI was not able to delete /Library/Desktop Pictures/El Capitan.jpg or remove it in my testing. I could make a copy of the file, and was even able to make a copy of it inside of /Library/Desktop Pictures.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to /Library/Desktop Pictures\r\n2. You can manipulate files in there.\r\n3. Attempt to manipulate El Capitan.jpg (rename, delete). File is locked.\r\n4. Do same process in Terminal. Even as sudo, permission denied.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to modify El Capitan.jpg, like all other files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot modify file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan Developer Beta 1 / 15A178w"
