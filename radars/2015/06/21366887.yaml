    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLSession Background Downloads take 2-3 minutes to start.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to download something with NSURLSession with a background configuration.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should start within a few seconds. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt takes a few minutes to start.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn iOS 8.4 background downloads almost always started within a few seconds (unless there was a backlog of downloads)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have set the NSAppTransport key to disable ATS, so that should not be the issue."
