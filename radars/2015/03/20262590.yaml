    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for -intrinsicContentSize describes it as the \"natural size for the receiving view, considering only properties of the view itself.\" This implies (to me at least) that a newly constructed view never configured or attached to any view hierarchy should return a consistent value from this method, since no property of the view itself changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, UINavigationBar seems to break this expectation: on an iPhone 6, the height returned from -intrinsicContentSize varies with the device's orientation. In portrait, the returned height is 44; in landscape, it's 32. While this accurately reflects the height that the navigation bar will take on in these orientations, it doesn't really fit the idea of \"intrinsic\" â€“ considering device-level factors in a single detached view is near the opposite.\r\n\r\nIt also makes it hard to get the \"default\" height of such a bar for calculation purposes. If that's a bad idea, or if there is no \"default\" height, UINavigationBar should probably return UIViewNoIntrinsicMetric for its intrinsic height, rather than one of a few different values that might be correct in some external conditions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app on an iPhone 6.\r\n2. In portrait, tap the button.\r\n3. In landscape, tap the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe logged height values should be identical. Preferably, they should either both be 44 or both be -1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe logged height values are different: in portrait, it logs 44, and in landscape, it logs 32.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 beta 3 (12F5047e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NavigationBarIntrinsicHeightTest.zip' was successfully uploaded.
