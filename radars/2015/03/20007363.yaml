    description: "Summary:\r\nA search scope that includes system frameworks will not actually search or match against any of the frameworks that are linked to by the targets in a workspace. It appears that it will only search frameworks that are explicitly included as file references in the project navigator.\r\n\r\nThis makes some sense, and has a long history e.g. with the old \"Other Frameworks\" group that was included in projects by default, in additino to the \"Linked Frameworks\" group. \r\n\r\nBut the approach is needlessly confusing and particularly out of alignment with Apple's modern project templates, which tend to favor implicit library dependencies, and do not include any system frameworks whatsoever among the project's references.\r\n\r\nIt's valuable and useful to \"Search against all the frameworks my targest link against\" and is probably the behavior that most people would expect when selecting this search scope. The fact that Xcode knows enough to implicitly (and/or explicitly) link the required frameworks, means it should also know enough to include all of those frameworks in the search scope.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Cocoa Application using default Xcode project template.\r\n2. Build and run to confirm that Cocoa has been linked to by the project.\r\n3. Click the magnifying glass to activate the search navigator.\r\n4. From Search Scopes select \"Workspace & Frameworks\"\r\n5. Search for something guaranteed to be present in Cocoa's framework headers, like \"NSTextField\".\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMatches in the linked frameworks should be included in the search results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo matches found.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.3 (6D520o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA related problem is that even if a framework is explcitly linked to, such as Cocoa.framework, only the header files of that specific framework will be searched, not the header files of subsidiary frameworks (e.g. Foundation and AppKit).\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
