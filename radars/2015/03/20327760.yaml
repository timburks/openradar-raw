    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a MacBook Pro that I connect to an Apple Thunderbolt Display and another external display at work. Almost every time I re-connect to these displays, whether the MacBook Pro was turned off or just sleeping beforehand, my desktop backgrounds are changed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a MacBook Pro to two external displays.\r\n2. Set one of the external displays as your primary display.\r\n3. Change your desktop backgrounds on all three displays to unique backgrounds (I use Yosemite, Yosemite 2, and Yosemite 3).\r\n4. Turn off the MacBook Pro, then boot it without any displays connected and log in, then turn it off.\r\n5. Re-connect it to the external displays, boot it, and log in again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe desktop backgrounds will still be set like they were after step 3.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe primary display has multiple desktops, with the saved backgrounds from step 3, and one or more of the other displays has the default background.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 (14C1514)"
