    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode should ship a “complete” app as a template. It should include as many of the main platform app features as possible such as state saving and restoration, handoff, a Today and WatchKit extension, push notifications, auto layout, accessibility, storyboards, and probably 4 or 5 other major app technologies and aspects that I have forgotten about.\r\n\r\nI think it would be insanely useful for myself, others, and anyone just starting out to see how you guys imagine how a functional, robust, rich app that actually does something should be assembled and structured.\r\n\r\nDon’t gloss over error handling. Don’t skip major platform features like handoff or a WatchKit companion app just because it is “out of scope” or whatever. Don’t rush to put this together a few weeks before WWDC. We need a real, polished, functional, quality example.\r\n\r\nThe issue is, many of us out here no longer see how everything fits together anymore. WWDC session videos do not do a good job with this sort of thing. Neither does the documentation. Those contexts are always focused on a single framework or technology at a time. That’s great when you’re trying to understand those things, but how does it all fit together? Does it all mesh smoothly? I’ll be honest - lately, it feels like more and more of the APIs and frameworks do not meld together nicely and I can’t tell if it’s just me misunderstanding things, of if it’s really true.\r\n\r\nShow us how it *all* works together and we’ll make better apps for your platform. Give us a fully functional sample app with all the major parts and we can start there and *remove* the bits we don’t need rather than guess at the parts we’re supposed to add.\r\n\r\nThings are getting very complex and I have a feeling most of us are building houses of cards. Help us out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to make a robust, complete, rich iOS app using the platform's strengths.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo be able to make awesome things.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDrown in overwhelming complexity."
