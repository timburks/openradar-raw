    description: "We use projects that have *both* iOS and Mac static library targets. \n\nWhen building the iOS target, if the project is configured as Mac SDK, target as iOS SDK, built products will remain red in Products listing, project tree, and cannot be accessed (although they are correctly built). \n\nWhen building that same iOS target, if the project is configured as iOS SDK, target as iOS SDK, built products become black once built, as expected.\n\nThis has all kind of implications. For instance, when we drag/drop a static lib from the build folder into Xcode hierarchy, and then we change that file reference type from \"Relative to Group\" to \"Relative to Build Products\", the computed path is not correct (if target and project don't have the same SDK). \n\nIt looks very much like the Build Products folder depends on Project SDK and not Target SDK, which is a wrong assumption in the general case."
