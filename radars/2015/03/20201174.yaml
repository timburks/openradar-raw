        Summary:
        We can set custom fonts on UILabels in Interface Builder, and with size classes we can set different fonts and sizes for different classes. Doing this _appears_ to work in Interface Builder â€” the font shows up correctly there, but when we build the app, it defaults back to the system fonts.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add a custom font to your project.
        2. Add it to UIAppFonts in the plist.
        3. Create a UILabel in Interface Builder and set the custom font on it.
        4. Add a size class and set a different size for it.
        5. Notice that it works in IB.
        6. Build the app.

        Expected Results:
        iOS should show the fonts in the same way Xcode did in IB.

        Actual Results:
        We default back to the system fonts.
