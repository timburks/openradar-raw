    description: "Summary:\r\nSpotlight, in Yosemite, was given lots of functions such as unit conversion (currency, length, weight etc.).\r\n\r\nOne glaring omission is time zones. For example, if I open Spotlight and enter “11:19 AM”, Spotlight should show what time it would be in various cities around the world (assuming that the time typed in refers to the user’s current time zone).\r\n\r\nIf the user enters a time and timezone other than their current timezone, it should show what time it would be. For example, entering “10:00 AM PDT”, for example, would show the equivalent time in the current timezone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Spotlight.\r\n2. Enter a time, with or without a timezone code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpotlight would show what that time would be in different world cities — New York, London, Hong Kong etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpotlight says file not found, or shows files that happen to include that string."
