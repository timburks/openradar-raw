    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the cursor is located on a blank line in a UITextView that is not and the end of the text, pressing the dictation microphone on the keyboard briefly shows dictation interface and immediately ends dictation without accepting input.\r\n\r\nDictation works as expected if the UITextView is blank or a line with text on it is selected and the microphone button is pressed.\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible in a clean app built with Xcode 6.2 and the iOS 8.2 SDK (as attached sample) and is visible in many apps, including Messages and in third party apps, including Facebook, Tumblr, Drafts, Tweetbot.  It is NOT present in many other apps â€“ including Notes and Mail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build & Run attached sample app on device.\r\n2. Place cursor on the blank line between the lines in the default text.\r\n3. Press the dictation mic button on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDictation should activate and accept input from user as normal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard momentarily shows dictation waveform interface and immediately beeps and ends dictation without accepting any input from the user.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 (possibly others, but I believe it's new in 8.2)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BUG_Dictation.zip' was successfully uploaded."
