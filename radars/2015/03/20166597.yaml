    description: "Summary:\r\nOur PushKit notifications are normally running without a problem, but occasionally notifications suddenly stop being received by the app and all notifications we send to the app disappear, until we quit the app and restart it by hand. From then on, any subsequent notifications are being received, but the ones that disappeared are never seen again.\r\n\r\nIn short we never see the delegate being called in this situation: `pushRegistry:didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload:forType:`\r\n\r\nWhen the problem is present I manage to restart to be notified again, when I change the phone's connectivity. Indeed when I disable/enable wifi on the device and I see the delegate being magically called again.\r\n \r\nAlso I don't know if it's related but I've notifications on battery related events in my app (UIDeviceBatteryLevelDidChangeNotification), and when I'm stuck with the PushKits not being forwarded to my app, the delegate is immediately called again when battery related events are sent by the system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCould not find a way to easily reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`pushRegistry:didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload:forType` Should be normally called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`pushRegistry:didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload:forType` is not called\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2, iOS 8.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone but but tests are on iPhone 6 & 6 Plus (WiFi & Cellular)"
