    description: "Summary:\r\nCertain albums bought from the iTunes store have a media kind of \"Music\" but might for example be mostly spoken content. iTunes has the ability to change the media kind of these albums, for example to audiobooks. However that option is not available if iTunes Match is enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable iTunes Match\r\n\r\n2. Buy an album from iTunes that one might want to categorise as an audiobook (for example: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/you-are-all-diseased/id250997192)\r\n\r\n3. Select the album and press cmd-I to access the item information, switch to the options tab\r\n\r\n4. Switch the media kind from \"Music\" to \"Audiobook\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanging the media kind should be possible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanging the media kind is not possible if iTunes Match is enabled\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 11.2.2"
