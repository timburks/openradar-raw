    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nQuicktimes files exported from Avid or Flame w/ \"None\" codec only show straight black video when played in Snow Leopard (audio works). Quicktime 7.6.4 & Quicktime X are both affected. This problem exists on all 3 of our Snow Leopard 10.6.2 MacPro1,1 systems w/ almost identical hardware configuration. The same files play back correctly on our Leopard & Windows systems.\r\n\r\nThe files can be brought into After Effects on the Snow Leopard systems (interpreted w/ \"Ignore Alpha\") and the video is visible. This leads me to believe that QT on SL is handling the Alpha channels incorrectly. \r\n\r\n Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Export quicktime w/ \"None\" video codec from Avid or Flame system.\r\n2. Open that file w/ QT 7.6.4 or QT X on Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\n Expected Results:\r\n\r\nVideo displays correctly.\r\n\r\n Actual Results:\r\n\r\nVideo displays black.\r\n\r\n Regression:\r\n\r\nThe same files play back correctly on a PowerMac G5 running Leopard w/ QT 7.6.4. or Windows Vista 64-bit w/ QT 7.6.4.\r\n\r\n Notes:\r\n\r\n* We have Final Cut Pro 7.01 installed on these systems.\r\n* We have Perian 1.4 installed on these systems, but I tried uninstalling Perian and the problem remained.\r\n* There is a thread for this problem here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2259769\r\n* I've attached a file that exhibits this problem. I trimmed it on one of the affected systems, so it's creator code may say QT, but it originally comes from an Avid running WinXP."
