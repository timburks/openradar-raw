    description: "Summary:\r\nConsider view controller A presenting view controller B fullscreen, which in turn presents view controller C as a popover.\r\n\r\nA single tap outside of the popover dismissed view controller C as expected. However if another tap is made in the same region before view controller C has finished dismissing, view controller B is also dismissed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch the sample project and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping twice to dismiss the popover view controller should not also dismiss its parent view controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTapping twice to dismiss the popover view controller also dismisses its parent view controller.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3"
