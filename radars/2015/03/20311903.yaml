    description: "Summary:\r\nI use rules to file emails. When I click on a folder to view the files emails, I expect to see them. However, after 10 seconds of no activity in a folder, Mail.app displays no emails and blanks the view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an email folder and sub-folder\r\n2. Move a whole bunch of emails into it\r\n3. Wait until the server has them.\r\n4. Select the folder\r\n5. Select an email\r\n6. Wait 10 seconds\r\n\r\n(See attached screen flow - only the mouse was touched)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that Mail.app continues to show the selected message and all the messages in the inbox.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe messages in the folder disappear and the selected message is no longer displayed. See attached video for proof.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 8.2 (2070.6)\r\nYosmite 10.10.2 (14C1514)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens on the latest Yosemite on a brand new Macbook Pro"
