    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode's commit-wide comparison window is an excellent tools for seeing all the changes before a commit, allowing the developer to check each change and ensure no accidental changes happen.\r\n\r\nIt is also highly useful when doing two similar changes to be able to look at the first set of changes and apply similar changes in another location (for example, if you are updating two independent applications with similar structure but not actually sharing code).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, what this tends to mean is the developer does not commit the first change so that the first change remains live in Xcode's commit-comparison while the second change is made.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fantastic  addition if there was an equivalent to the commit-wide comparison that allowed the selection of the two revisions, especially that allowed the user to see the just committed changes after the commit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C131e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
