        Summary:
        On iPad, while on Landscape and try to fill notes on a just created reminder as soon as the keyboard shows up the popover becomes empty with no way of writing. turning portrait doesnâ€™t seam to fix the problem, however dismissing the popover and retrying in portrait works.
