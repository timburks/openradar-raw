    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter removing /var/folders (for various troubleshooting reasons documented at http://blog.magnusviri.com/what-is-var-folders.html) from a 10.10 system and rebooting the progress bar proceeds about 50% and hangs - it never boots.  Examining the drive while booted from another source show that the directories are not re-created and the system.log shows many errors about /var/folders/zz does not exist. The same steps taken on a 10.9 system do not result in a hang and upon inspection post-boot show the directories have been recreated.\r\n\r\nIf only the contents are deleted in 10.10 by running `rm -r /var/folders/*` the system boots fine.\r\nPrevious versions of OS X did not exhibit this behavior if the parent directory was removed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boot into 10.10\r\n2. In Terminal run the following `rm -r /var/folders`\r\n3. Reboot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe computer would reboot and recreate the deleted directories\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system boots about 50%, the cursor appears on screen but doesn't proceed past that.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2/14c109\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached the system.log from the 10.10 system.  Filtering for \"mkdir\" shows many errors of services trying to access a non-existent directory.\r\nThe 10.9 log has no entries pertaining to /var/folders after reboot so I didn't find it beneficial to include it in this report."
