    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a fairly slow internet connection, so downloading things like documentation and simulators for a new version take a fair amount of time.\r\n\r\nI also have difficulty keeping Xcode running for long periods of time (such as rdar://20160622 ), requiring Xcode to be restarted to clear out jammed devices, simulators, provisioning, and playgrounds.\r\n\r\nSo, it would be nice if Xcode, like Safari, could buffer large downloads and not jettison them when Xcode exits.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a slow internet connection\r\n2. Download a large component, such as an iOS Simulator or the OS X 10.10 documentation.\r\n3. Wait several hours.  The download is about half-way through\r\n4. Trigger rdar://20160622 and have to restart Xcode before I can get any other work done.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. I quit Xcode. Next time I start up, the download resumes (with or without prompt)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. the download is jettisoned, and I have to start over for that component.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.2 (6C131e)\r\n10.9.5 13F34"
