    description: "Xcode does not create the Resources folder inside a playground. Additionally, it prevents a user from creating this folder manually through the Finder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new playground called MyPlayground.playground in Xcode\r\n2. Reveal the project navigator\r\n3. Observe the faded Resources folder\r\n4. Locate MyPlayground.playground in the Finder (leave it open in Xcode)\r\n5. Open MyPlayground.playground using the “Show Package Contents” context menu entry\r\n6. Observe that there is no folder titled “Resources\"\r\n7. Create a new folder titled “Resources\"\r\n8. Observe the new Resources folder disappear\r\n9. Close the MyPlayground.playground Xcode window\r\n10. Create a new folder titled “Resources” inside MyPlayground.playground in the Finder\r\n11. Reopen MyPlayground.playground in Xcode\r\n12. Reveal the project navigator\r\n13. Observe the non-faded Resources folder\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Resources folder will be automatically created by Xcode when the playground is created. Additionally, creating the Resources folder manually will not be prevented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode does not create the Resources folder with the playground. Having the playground open prevents creating this folder manually.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: (hardware)\r\niMac 27-inch, Late 2012\r\nMacBook Air, Mid 2013\r\n\r\nVersion & Build:\r\nXcode 6.3 beta 3 (6D543q)\r\nOS X 10.10.3 seed 5 (14D113c)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\nThe Resources folder is created automatically by Xcode when a file is dragged into the Project Navigator."
