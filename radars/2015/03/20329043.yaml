    description: "Summary:\r\nI have Reeder (http://reederapp.com/mac/) configured as my Mac’s default RSS reader. When I click on a link to an RSS feed, I would like the feed to open in Reeder. This works, but every time I navigate to an RSS feed I am prompted to add the feed to Safari’s Shared Links. Since I never want to add a link to Shared Links, I would very much like a way to avoid that alert.\r\n\r\nA screenshot of the alert is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Install Reeder (http://reederapp.com/mac/) and make it your default RSS reader. (I assume that any third party app configured to handle feed:// URLs will have the same effect.)\r\n\r\n2.  Open this URL in Safari for OS X:\r\nhttp://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/about/\r\n\r\n3.  Follow the “RSS” link on that page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally, I want the RSS feed to open in Reeder, or whatever my default RSS reader is, and for Safari to never ask about Shared Links.\r\n\r\nThere may be reasons for my desired behavior to not be the default behavior, even for users with an external RSS reader configured. In that case, I would ask that there be a suppression checkbox. If I check the suppression checkbox and click “Cancel”, I would want RSS feeds to always open in my external reader without prompting me in the future.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get prompted to add the feed to Shared Links every time I click on an RSS feed, and I have no way to avoid this prompt.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0.5 (10600.5.15) on OS X 10.10.3 (14D113c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sharedlinks.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
