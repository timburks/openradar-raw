    description: "Summary:\r\nThis isn’t exactly a problem, but normally whenever there is a new update to Mail with changes to any of the interfaces of Mail Classes (or it’s supporting libraries), the PluginCompatibilityUUID is updated with a new one to ensure that loaded plugins have tested themselves against the new version.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the 10.10.3 betas (all of them so far), this has not been the case.\r\n\r\nWe think this creates a support issue for both Apple and for those of us that write plugins.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall any version of 10.10.3 and not that despite the fact that there are class interface changes, no PluginCompatibilityUUID changes are occurring.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach release of the beta that has class interface changes should update the PluginCompatibilityUUID.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo new UUIDs, even if there are changes to the class interfaces.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been the case for all versions of 10.10.2 released to developers.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
