    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode, while setting up a build bot on Xcode Server, the sheet for providing repository credentials does not provide enough information and can sometimes be confusing. In particular, if the git repository is currently using https for its default remote, the credential \"Type\" drop down box will be disabled with no indication as to why. Even though \"User Name and Password\" is the only appropriate choice in that case, since there is no indication of why it is disabled or even which remote Xcode intends to use for the build bot the user can be left scratching their head figuring it out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone a remote git repository using https. The repository should contain an Xcode project.\r\n2. Open the Xcode project.\r\n3. Click Products -> Create bot...\r\n4. Click \"Next\"\r\n5. When the \"Please provide credentials for this bot\" sheet appears, press \"Change\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the credential sheet which appears, the \"Type\" field is disabled, but there is some indication as to why. For example, a message stating something to the effect of \"This remote type allows only User name and Password credentials.\" Alternatively, no extra message may be necessary if the remote Xcode is going to use for the bot is displayed (see attached Credentials-better.png). For many users this would provide enough information to determine why the credential type drop down box is disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Type\" drop down box is disabled for no obvious reason.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1, Xcode 6.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.9, 10.10\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Credentials-current.png' and 'Credentials-better.png' were successfully uploaded."
