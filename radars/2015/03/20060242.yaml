        Summary:
        It should be possible to delete an app from iTunes Connect that’s in “Prepare for Submission” state with no uploaded binaries or approved versions.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a new app in iTunes Connect. Without uploading a binary, look for the “Delete App” link under the “More” menu.

        Expected Results:
        “Delete App” should be present, allowing you to delete the app from iTunes Connect.

        Actual Results:
        It’s not possible to delete an app that has never been approved nor uploaded a binary.

        Notes:
        During development, it’s often necessary to create an app in iTunes Connect. (For example, when working with In-App Purchases or Game Center.) Occasionally, developers may decide not to release those apps. The current behavior leaves the apps as orphans in iTunes Connect. Besides cluttering up the My Apps screen, it has the unfortunate side effect of reserving app names so they can’t be used by other developers. Well-meaning developers should be able to clean out apps they don’t intend to release.
