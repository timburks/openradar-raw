    description: "Summary:\nSince iOS 7, more and more apps support additional dark themes besides the default light theme. Yosemite already has system-wise dark mode. iOS should also do. The settings could be similar to that of Do Not Disturb:\n1. One Auto-Dark with Time option for switching to dark mode automatically according to time, can be user-specified time or smartly use sunrise/sunset times.  \n2. One Auto-Dark with Brightness option for switching to dark mode automatically according to screen brightness, with user-specified threshold.\n3. Maybe, a gesture for switching mode manually.\n\nWith such a system-wise dark mode, app developers no longer need to offer those settings repeatedly in every app. We can determine whether it is in dark mode via SDK and change UI accordingly."
