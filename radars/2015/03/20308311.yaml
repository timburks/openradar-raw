    description: "Summary:\r\nObtaining Text type Scan previews takes an excessive amount of time (> 2 minutes) while the scans themselves complete under a few seconds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Preview\r\n2. File -> Import from Scannerâ€¦\r\n3. Show Details, make sure \"Text\" type is selected\r\n4. Wait for scan preview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScan preview should complete as quickly (if not faster) as a regular scan.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScan preview takes close to 2 minutes to complete.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 (14D113c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScan previews are slightly faster when using \"Black and White\" or \"Color\" but still takes close to a minute to complete while an actual scan operation completes under mere seconds.\r\n\r\nI have observed the same slow scan preview behaviour with a Wi-Fi connected Epson WF-2540 printer.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from earlier behaviour. I have used the same scanners on a different computers running OS X Mavericks and scan previews completed much more quickly (in seconds instead of minutes).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRunning OS X Preview on an iMac 5K with Retina, connected via Ethernet connection with HP Officejet Pro 8610 printer."
