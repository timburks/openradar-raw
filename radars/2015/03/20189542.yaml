    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a particular message selected in Mail and change the sort order of the list, Mail does not ensure that the selected message remains in the visible area of the list afterwards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a mailbox with a fairly large number of messages, so that there are significantly more than fit in the visible portion of the list.\r\n2. Select a message in the list\r\n3. Use the View > Sort By menu to change how the list is sorted (e.g. switching from sorting by date to sorting by \"From\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter sorting the list, Mail should scroll the list so that the message you had selected before is still visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scroll view remains at whatever position it was before, so the selected message will often no longer be visible, and require either manual scrolling or poking at the up/down arrow keys to get back to the selected message.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail 8.2 (2089)/OS X 10.10.3 (14D98g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe use case for this situation is as follows.\r\n1. You receive a new message from a particular person.\r\n2. You want to take a look at other recent correspondance with that person, so you sort the list by \"From\", so that other email from that person are listed right next to the new message that you're looking at.\r\n3. Once you're done, you then switch back to sorting the list by date.\r\n\r\nHowever, having the selected message disappear from the visible part of the list defeats this method, which is meant to be able to quickly see that person's messages without having to scroll around at all.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happens both in the default layout and the \"classic\" layout modes in Mail."
