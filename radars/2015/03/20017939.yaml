    description: "[Update from Apple: \"There are no plans to address this. We are now closing this report.\"]\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis bit us in the latest release of ActiveHours (v.3.3). It's unclear to us how it passed our testing...perhaps we never tested the exact code path in Release mode...but as soon as it made it into customers hands, we experienced a high volume of reproducible crashes!\r\n\r\nQuick side note: if you have _any_ sway with the iTunes Connect team, we'd really appreciate getting v.3.4 reviewed and in customers' hands ASAP! The only change in that build is adding the .stringValue method, per \"Workaround 3\" in the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the root of the issue is all in the title. I don't know enough about the inner workings of Swift & the Foundation framework to say more here, but I've provided very detailed findings in the sample project's ViewController.swift comments.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip the attached SwiftyCrasher.zip\r\n2. Check out the \"crash\" branch in git\r\n3. Open the sample project in Xcode 6.1.1\r\n4. Verify that the scheme Build Configuration is set to Release\r\n5. Run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should not crash (or, minimally, should fail equally in Debug mode)\r\n\r\nBy way of investigation, try the 3 \"workaround\" branches. As far as I can tell, this is either a Swift 1.1 bug, a Foundation bug, or some combination of both.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes in Release mode, but works just fine in Debug mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.1.1, Simulator or on-device\r\n\r\n[Email me at chris.lozach@activehours.com if you would like a copy of the sample project that illustrates this bug.]"
