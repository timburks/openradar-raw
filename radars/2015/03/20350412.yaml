    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a second window is presented in landscape, the wrong point is sent to that window's -hitTest:withEvent: and -touchesBegan:withEvent: methods under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the attached example app (on device or in the iOS Simulator)\r\n2. Rotate so the view is displayed in landscape\r\n3. Tap *Button*\r\n4. When the yellow view appears, try to tap *Button 2*\r\n5. Look in the Console for two logs containing \"hitTest Event:\" and the same timestamp\r\n6. Also look in the Console for logs about \"touchesBegan\", \"touchesMoved\", \"touchesEnded\", etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"hitTest Event:\" logs with the same timestamp should be logging the same point. Similarly, the logs for \"touchesBegan\", \"touchesEnded\", etc. should be logging points in roughly the same location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor the \"hitTest Event:\" logs, the y-coordinate of the second event is different than the first (and appears to be capped past a certain point). Similarly, the y-coordinate of \"location in window\" and \"location in view\" for the \"touchesBegan\" log and the \"touchesEnded\" and \"touchesMoved\" log differ by more than a few points.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny version of iOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExample project with notes have been posted to https://github.com/hjon/WindowTest."
