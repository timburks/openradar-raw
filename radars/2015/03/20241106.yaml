    description: "When using a Launch.xib in an iPhone-only app (with deployment target iOS 8.0), the launch UI is zoomed to full size on iPad and is not constrained to the 1x or 2x box used for iPhone apps on iPad.\r\n\r\nSee also rdar://18371031 which seems to be fixed. So after launch the app is correctly framed in the 1/2x box but the launch screen is not."
