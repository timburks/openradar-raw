    description: "Summary:\nI would love XCTest to steal a page out of JUnit 4 and Android Studio’s book and add some kind of way to mark that certain tests should be ignored, then display those ignores to the user. \n\nThe documentation for the @Ignore annotation is available here: http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Ignore.html - perhaps something similar to the new nullable/nonnullable annotations could be used. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Write a test\n2. Have some known issue that makes you need to temporarily disable the test (usually: Someone broke something on the server)\n3. Realize you have to either use the DISABLED hack (described here: http://www.objc.io/issue-15/xctest.html) or comment out your test until that issue is addressed.\n\nExpected Results:\n1. Write a test\n2. Have some known issue that makes you need to temporarily disable the test.\n3. Add ignore annotation, have test skipped and visibly marked as skipped. \n\nActual Results:\n(see “steps to reproduce”)\n\nRegression:\nNone\n\nNotes:\nThis has actually come in SUPER handy with my android testing - the tests being marked as ignored make it clear that those tests exist but are not being run. See attached screenshot."
