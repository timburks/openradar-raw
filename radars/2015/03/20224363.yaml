    description: "Summary:\nUsing encodeCGPoint: forKey: and decodeCGPointForKey: to first encode and later decode a CGPoint with the value of CGPointMake(INFINITY, INFINITY) produces a point with the x and y value set to 0, instead of to INFINITY.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOpen the attached sample project and run the tests target. \n\nExpected Results:\nThe decoded CGPoint would have it’s x and y components set to INFINITY, matching the original.\n\nActual Results:\nThe decoded CGPoint has it’s x and y components set to 0, IN CONTRAST WITH the original.\n\nRegression:\nTested on iOS 8 and iOS 7 simulator as well as on an iPhone 6 with iOS 8.2.\n\nNotes:\nEncoding a CGFloat with encodeDouble:forKey: and decoding with decodeDoubleForKey: works as expected for INFINITY values."
