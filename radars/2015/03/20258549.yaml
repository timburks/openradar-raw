    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a test app on iTunes Connection you might want to delete it because you have no intention to ever send it to review. The interface however does not provide a delete method in this case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at the app with Apple identifier 958076425, titled \"CocoaneticsExample\"\r\n2. Try to find the \"Delete App\" option on the More menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- you should be able to delete an app that has no approved versions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- you are stuck because you would never submit a build, so you never will have an approved version\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0.5 (10600.5.9)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI propose that you simply extend the ability to delete apps to apps that don't have any approved versions."
