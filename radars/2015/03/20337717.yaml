    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a headless Mac Mini that I recently updated to Yosemite from Mavericks.  I have the server package installed but it's not doing anything yet.\r\n\r\nEvery day since that upgrade, I can no longer ping that machine by its \"sharing\" name, vidbox.local.  I can access it by IP address.  If I log in and kill discoveryd, then I get to access the machine by its sharing name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a mac mini. Have this machine be your central media server, feeding Apple TVs, other machines, iPads for the whole family.\r\n\r\nUpgrade from 10.9 to 10.10.  \r\n\r\nAccess the machine happily by its name \"vidbox.local\"\r\n\r\ngo to sleep\r\n\r\nwake up\r\n\r\nTry to access the machine by its name vidbox.local\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can access the machine\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n% ping vidbox.local\r\nping: cannot resolve vidbox.local: Unknown host\r\n\r\nAppleTVs can't access the media.  iPads and whatnot are inert.\r\n\r\nI have to log in (luckily the IP doesn't change), kill discoveryd, and then things work ok, until the next morning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nSystem profiler attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFIrewall is of_.  System is configured to not sleep.\r\n\r\nLemme know what other information I can provide to you.  I need 10.10 because I am planning on using Xcode bots (and 6.3 apparently requires 10.10), and I need a working system lest the household starts a mutiny :-)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWorked great in 10.9. Never had a problem.  It has yet to work reliably in 10.10."
