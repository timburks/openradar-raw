    description: "Summary:\r\nA nice to have feature would be to get a string representation of an enum case, i.e. to ask it for its name.\r\n\r\nSince each enum case already needs to have a unique name/descriptor, it should be possible to simple return that at runtime.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following enum:\r\n\r\nenum Foo {\r\n    case Bar\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet foo = Foo.Bar\r\nlet name = foo.caseName // \"Bar\"\r\n\r\nNo associated values or information about those would be included with the name.\r\n\r\nThis would allow conversion of all enum cases to a primitive representation without resorting to raw values or manually providing names for all cases. This can be useful for generating descriptions of enums, serialization, etc...\r\n\r\nObviously this also can/will be part of the reflection APIs provided for enum types in some way so it might not make much sense to include it separately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 - Beta 3 (6A254o)\r\nSwift version 1.0 (swift-600.0.38.7)\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A283o)"
