    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLLoading should support logging all HTTP Requests and Responses (including all cookies and authentication headers) as well as logging all TLS handshakes.\r\n\r\nI've implemented a simplified HTTP Request/Response Logger [1] based on your CustomHTTPProtocol example [2]\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/jivesoftware/JiveLoggingHTTPProtocol\r\n[2] https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/CustomHTTPProtocol/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd an NSURLSession object to enable logging to a delegate or to a file (in case a background request needs to be logged)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor foreground requests, log object is created that consumers can log to a file or upload to a reporting system.\r\nFor background requests, the log is appended to the prescribed file\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe best we can do is to use something like https://github.com/jivesoftware/JiveLoggingHTTPProtocol\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
