    description: "In IB a \"selectable\" flag can be set for specific WKInterfaceTable row controllers.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to specify this at runtime for each row.\r\n\r\nIn many use cases actions can only be allowed if certain conditions are met. Of course this can be addressed by enabling \"selectable\" and then later doing nothing when the user actually selects the row. But this is an unintuitive UI."
