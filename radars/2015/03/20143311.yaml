    description: "According to PEP 394 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/), OS X's built-in Python 2.7 should be accessible not only as \"python\" and \"python2.7\", but also as \"python2\".\r\n\r\nThis requires only adding a symlink named /usr/bin/python2 pointing to either ./python or ./python2.7 (either one seems reasonable), which shouldn't cause any backward-compatibility or maintenance problems.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this should be fixed in dot releases for all currently-maintained OS X versions, not just in 10.11."
