        Summary:
        Using a property getter on a separate line from the receiver results in “could not find member 'blah'”. This works fine for methods, leading me to think this is a weird parsing bug and it’s looking for a static property `blah` on the enclosing type, or something like that.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Write this code:
        [0]
        	.count



        Expected Results:
        I expected that to compile, resolving to the value 1: Int.


        Actual Results:
        error: could not find member 'count'


        Regression:
        According to @bavarious this occurs in Swift 1.1 as well and is therefore not a (recent) regression.

        You can work around it with this absurdity involving parentheses:

        ([0]
        	).count


        Notes:
        I run into this semi-regularly with properties like `count` on `Array` and `array` on `Lazy*View`, but hadn’t tracked it down to being just a newline thing; hat tip to @bavarious for the reduction.
