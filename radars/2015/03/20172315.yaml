    description: "Summary:\r\nMobile Safari crashes or reloads the page showing \"A problem occurred with this webpage so it was reloaded\". when the user takes a photo after tapping on a HTML file input.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a few other tabs with relatively heavy websites (NYTimes, Guardian, CNN, BBC, Adobe, Google image search)\r\n2. Open a website with a file upload on it\r\n3. Select \"Choose file\"\r\n4. Select \"Take Picture\" from the action sheet\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected file should populate the input field without crashing the tab/browser.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the website reloads and shows \"A problem occurred with this webpage so it was reloaded\" in the banner at the top. On a few occasions we've seen Mobile Safari crashing completely, not just reloading the current tap.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 (12D508)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe behaviour is more likely to happen the more memory is used by a website and other tabs. However, at the same time, we tried reducing the memory footprint of our website and it doesn't make much of a difference.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's relevant but we also use a few CSS transitions.\r\n\r\nWe tried building an isolated case to showcase the behaviour. However with a lot less CSS and Javascript it doesn't cause the crash/reload.\r\n\r\nAlso, trying the same on other devices it seems to be only happening on iPhone 6.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, 64GB, O2 UK, using WiFi\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crash log shows:\r\n\r\nException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\r\nException Subtype: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0004000000000368\r\nTriggered by Thread:  0\r\n\r\nThread 0 name:  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\r\nThread 0 Crashed:\r\n0   WebKit                        \t0x000000018a775e94 WebKit::WebPageProxy::didChooseFilesForOpenPanelWithDisplayStringAndIcon(WTF::Vector<WTF::String, 0ul, WTF::CrashOnOverflow> const&, WTF::String const&, API::Data const*) + 44\r\n1   WebKit                        \t0x000000018a751de4 WebKit::WebOpenPanelResultListenerProxy::chooseFiles(API::Array*, API::String*, API::Data const*) + 100\r\n2   WebKit                        \t0x000000018a751de4 WebKit::WebOpenPanelResultListenerProxy::chooseFiles(API::Array*, API::String*, API::Data const*) + 100\r\n3   WebKit                        \t0x000000018a70357c -[WKFileUploadPanel _chooseFiles:displayString:iconImage:] + 468\r\n4   libdispatch.dylib             \t0x0000000196a0d990 _dispatch_call_block_and_release + 20\r\n5   libdispatch.dylib             \t0x0000000196a0d950 _dispatch_client_callout + 12\r\n6   libdispatch.dylib             \t0x0000000196a12208 _dispatch_main_queue_callback_4CF + 1604\r\n7   CoreFoundation                \t0x000000018539e2e8 __CFRUNLOOP_IS_SERVICING_THE_MAIN_DISPATCH_QUEUE__ + 8\r\n8   CoreFoundation                \t0x000000018539c390 __CFRunLoopRun + 1488\r\n9   CoreFoundation                \t0x00000001852c91f0 CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 392\r\n10  GraphicsServices              \t0x000000018e6eb6f8 GSEventRunModal + 164\r\n11  UIKit                         \t0x0000000189c5a108 UIApplicationMain + 1484\r\n12  MobileSafari                  \t0x000000010006b494 0x100064000 + 29844\r\n13  libdyld.dylib                 \t0x0000000196a3aa04 start + 0"
