    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter installing an OS update (version upgrade or security patch), OS X acts like I’m launching apps for the first time, even when I’ve used them before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using Automator, create a workflow launched by Calendar\r\n2. Move the calendar event around, causing the alarm to fire\r\n3. Click “Open” when asked whether you want to open the application for the first time\r\n4. The workflow runs\r\n5. Repeat Step 2\r\n6. The workflow runs\r\n7. Install an update to OS X (such as a minor version upgrade or a security patch)\r\n8. Move the calendar event around again, causing the alarm to fire a third time\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe workflow runs, as it did in Step 6\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get a security prompt, as I did in Step 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen installing a major update (10.10, 10.9) this behavior is annoying, but not totally unexpected. For minor bumps within the same OS version, it’s frustrating and unexpected, especially if you have many scripts triggered through Calendar, as I do"
