    description: "Summary:\n\nSerializing an image using NSKeyedArchiver produces different results depending on how the image was loaded. \n\n- For images loaded with imageNamed: the image data is not serialized (which prohibits us from deserializing the image in full later on). \n- Images loaded with imageWithContentsOfFile: get completely preserved. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nOpen the attached project and run it. Follow the onscreen instructions and compare the different displayed results. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe image would be fully preserved even when loading it using imageNamed:.\n\nActual Results:\n\nImages loaded with imageNamed: do not get fully serialized when using NSKeyedArchiver. \n\nRegression:\n\nOccurs on iOS 8.2. Also happens on iOS 7. \n\nNotes:\n\nUsing imageWithContentsOfFile: works. Drawing images loaded with imageNamed: into a new bitmap context and obtaining a new image from it also works."
