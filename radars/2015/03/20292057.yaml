    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are times, especially when making WatchKit apps, where I find myself wanting two image sets to reference the same image file (for instance, providing 2x, 38mm, and 42mm versions of an image by symlinking 2x to 38mm). However, based on some testing, it appears that symlinked images are copied multiple times when the Assets.car file is compiled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build the attached sample app.\r\n2. Inspect the built Assets.car file and note its size.\r\n3. Remove the symlinked image set (\"toady.jpg\")\r\n4. Re-build the app.\r\n5. Inspect the built Assets.car file and note its size.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Assets.car files will not have appreciably different sizes, since the image was symlinked to both locations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Assets.car file, in my testing got about 40K smaller.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C131e)\\"
