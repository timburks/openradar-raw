    description: "Summary:\r\nNormally control-clicking a view and right-clicking it will send menuForEvent: to the view, and the view will return its context menu.\r\n\r\nIf the view has no custom menu, it will ask its superview, though *only* if right-clicking. When control-clicking the menuForEvent: is not passed to its superview.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari and create a few tabs\r\n2. Right-click a close-button and notice the menu that appear\r\n3. Control-click a close-button and the tab closes\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor #3 I expect the same menu to appear. This would be consistent with control-clicking anywhere else on the tab (perhaps with the exception of the overflow button).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tab closes when control-clicking its close button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5 / Build 13F1066"
