        Summary:
        Apple Mail groups unrelated messages as discussed in this thread on your support forum: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6642737

        This happens on iOS Mail as well.

        I already talked to my provider (FastMail) about this because I expected it to be an issue on their end. However, the web interface does not show this behaviour. Their support team pointed me to the aforementioned forum post.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        This automatically appears for different threads.

        Expected Results:
        The message group should only display related messages.

        Actual Results:
        Two or more message threads are merged into one.

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
