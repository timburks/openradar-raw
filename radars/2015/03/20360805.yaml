    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no keyboard shortcut for the “Revert Changes” dialog button when closing a modified document when the “Ask to keep changes when closing documents” dialog box is checked in System Preferences > General.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Check the “Ask to keep changes when closing documents” dialog box is checked in System Preferences > General\r\n2. Open a PDF in Preview.app\r\n3. Highlight something in the PDF\r\n4. Close Preview.app\r\n5. Try to use a keyboard shortcut to trigger “Revert Changes” in the dialog box that appears\r\n6. Cry a little bit, resort to reaching for the mouse and clicking “Revert Changes” (like an animal)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a keyboard shortcut to match command-d for “Don’t Save” in the unsaved document dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere appears to be no keyboard shortcut for “Revert Changes”.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOS X generally as great support for keyboard shortcuts. This is just a minor issue, but it is an annoyance for users like me who rely on keyboard shortcuts a lot.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: https://tmp.m-n.us/Napkin-03-31-15-5.55.10-AM-7zidIcugyX"
