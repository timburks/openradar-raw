    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I add some strict warnings, Xcode throws warnings on some Apple headers that I have no control over.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project via File → New → Project. Choose iOS → Application → Single View Application.\r\n2. For Product Name, type MyApp. Choose Objective-C and Universal. Save the project.\r\n3. Build the project with CommandB. Run the tests with CommandU. Observe that they both finish with no errors or warnings.\r\n4. Click on the Project to go to the Project Settings.\r\n5. Click on the blue MyApp Project (as opposed to MyApp or MyAppTests targets).\r\n6. Click on the Build Settings tab.\r\n7. Search for Other Warning Flags.\r\n8. Enter the following string for the Other Warning Flags for the app: -Weverything -Wno-objc-missing-property-synthesis -Wno-objc-property-synthesis -Wno-direct-ivar-access -Wno-assign-enum -Wno-float-equal -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-switch-enum -Wno-gnu -Wnewline-eof\r\n9. Build the app again. You should see three or four warnings about treating #import as @import, which is expected given the warnings you just enabled.\r\n10. Clean the project with CommandShiftK\r\n11. Build again. You may see extra warnings. If not, then you need to…\r\n12. Delete the DerivedData folder, at least for this project. It is located at /Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyApp-*, where * is some random identifier string. You may also need to delete /Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ModuleCache.\r\n13. Clean and build again. And again. It may take a few times. Eventually...\r\n14. You will see code and documentation warnings on XCAbstractTest.h, XCTestCase.h, and XCTestSuite.h. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warnings besides the #import → @import ones.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWarnings on XCAbstractTest.h, XCTestCase.h, and XCTestSuite.h. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems to have happened recently, perhaps as of Xcode 6? But I don’t have an exact regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOriginally posted on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28844616/warnings-on-xcabstracttest-h-xctestcase-h-and-xctestsuite-h\r\nAttached screenshot and sample project that reproduces the problem on my computer.\r\nAttachments also uploaded here: http://cl.ly/a2Li"
