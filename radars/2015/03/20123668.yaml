    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a UILabel and sizeToFit(), the size returned appears incorrect for certain of the ‘new’ emoji. Specifically those emoji which use U+2764 HEAVY BLACK HEART return the size that would be expected if each emoji were rendered independently.\r\n\r\nAnd actually it seems like in some scenarios they _are_ being rendered independently, although this issue remains even when they are not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ninsert the appropriate text into a UILabel and call sizeToFit().\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe size should be less then that of the joined emoji, unjoined.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe size is roughly (n)x wider then expected, where n is the number of emoji in the joined group\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdditionally, I would be _very_ curious about the following:\r\n1) why it was decided to use two distinct joiners for the ’kiss on lips’ combos (\U0001F468‍❤️‍\U0001F48B‍\U0001F468), (\U0001F468❤️\U0001F48B\U0001F468) when it feels like the \U0001F48B\r\nU+1F48B KISS MARK itself contains the semantic information required. \r\n2) why it was decided to use a heart which requires an emoji variation selector, which feels like basically just asking for trouble, and which probably has _something_ to do with this bug report (I might’ve gone with \U0001F497 U+1F497 GROWING HEART, which has a certain poetry?) \r\n\r\nAnyway, deeply saddened not to have been in the room for this particular bike shed. \U0001F622\U0001F4AD\U0001F6B4\U0001F3E0\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve included two screenshots: these are from a custom keyboard extension that reads the text before the cursor and then just displays the unicode scalars; it also displays the result of assigning the text and calling sizeToFit() on an otherwise unconfigured uilabel."
