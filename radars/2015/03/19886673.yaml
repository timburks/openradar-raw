    description: "Using finder, I sometimes observe an offset between the expected position of an UI element and the actual position.\r\n\r\nExample A)\r\nWhen renaming a file in a Finder window, you expect the UI element for editing the file name to appear where the filename was previously displayed. In other words, you expect to edit the file name \"in place\". \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes the text field is vertically offset so it appears outside of the Finder window or not at all.\r\n\r\nExample B)\r\nDragging a folder to drop it on the finder sidebar, usually a blue \"target line\" appears which indicates the place where the folder would be placed if the user released the mouse button. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes the \"target line\" appears way offset from the mouse position.\r\n\r\nRestarting Finder usually fixes this issue (at least temporarily)."
