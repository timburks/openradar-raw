    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://14135016\n\n12-Jun-2013 05:07 PM Jeffrey Wear:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen instruments is first run after its host computer has been restarted, it requests authorization to take control of the process to be analyzed, in the form of a dialog requesting the user's password (see here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9476131/is-there-a-way-to-remove-the-authorization-prompt-from-command-line-instances-of). If this dialog is canceled, a prompt then appears at the command-line asking for the user's password. instruments will not run the specified template until the user has entered their password, either into the dialog or at the command line.\r\n\r\nThe request for authorization severely hampers the utility of the instruments tool in a continuous integration environment (for instance, to automatically run a series of UIAutomation tests every night). For such an environment to run un-attended, the user's must hardcode their login password into their test script and add logic to enter this password into the dialog.\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to run the instruments tool without needing to authorize it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Restart your computer (in case you have previously authorized instruments).\r\n2. Execute `sh RunUIAutomationTests.sh` from the root directory of the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments should run the `LogIn.js` script using the Automation trace template (as directed by `RunUIAutomationTests.sh`).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAn authorization dialog appears, and the instruments tool suspends execution.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis workaround (http://stackoverflow.com/a/11416025/495611) works on my local machine, but not our build server.\r\n\r\nThis issue is very similar to rdar://10945962, though that issue mentions seeing the dialog when the Instruments GUI runs and that has never produced the dialog for me.\r\n\r\nI have reproduced this using the Xcode 5 developer tools (build 5A11314m)."
