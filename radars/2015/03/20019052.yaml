    description: When a CIColor is created from a CGColorRef that has a specific CGColorSpaceRef, it does not appear that CIColor takes it into account, despite doc saying so. Instead, it does appear that the CIColor interprets it as device colorspace values. Which in turns lead to incorrect filter results.
