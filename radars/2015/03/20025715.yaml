    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a NetRestore volume, the machine in question will not have the latest EFI patch that corrects the Thunderstrike vulnerability. The machine will only receive the patch from the following delta/combo update.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that Firmware Updates are now longer issued through SUS environments outside of delta/combo updates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download OS X Yosemite (latest at this time is 10.10.2) from the Mac App Store.\r\n2. Open System Image Utility.\r\n3. Select the Install OS X Yosemite (10.10.2, 14C109) source.\r\n4. Select NetRestore image, click Continue.\r\n5. Leave the default settings, create a dummy admin user to allow the process to continue.\r\n6. Choose a target destination for the final output image and start the build.\r\n7. Deploy to a client machine that has not had 10.10.2 installed previously.\r\n\r\nOR \r\n1. Use this same process with OS X Yosemite 10.10.0 and the EFI patch will not apply.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEFI patch should be applied post since this is somewhat expected behavior with bit-based imaging.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEFI will not be patched until next combo/delta update. If a new NetRestore image is created, the following machines will be impacted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.0/10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCombo/Delta updates also contain FirmwareUpdate.pkg\r\n\r\nThe package does not have any sanity checks and only installs a receipt. There is no packageinfo.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis will not occur when using NetInstall or through the Mac App Store application."
