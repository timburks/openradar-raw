    description: "Apple Developer Relations20-Mar-2015 07:45 AM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. \r\n\r\nThe open or closed status of the original bug report your issue was duplicated to appears in the yellow \"Duplicate of XXXXXXXX\" section of the bug reporter user interface. This section appears near the top of the right column's bug detail view just under the bug number, title, state, product and rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNotes defined in aupreset-file that need to be shifted, jump out of tune a few cents after about 1, 2 secs. Not shifted notes stay stable. This happens on iOS 8.x, not on iOS7.1 (device or simulator).\r\nMy app \"Gender for iOS\" emulates a balinese gamelan instrument, where two instruments of the same are constant detuned to each other about 5 hz, so there is any change of frequency heard immediately as the beating rate changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the provided altered LoadPresetDemo:\r\nThere are three aupresets with the same three samples:\r\n1. no pitch shifting\r\n2. pitch shifting by a half step\r\n3. pitch shifting through fine tuning\r\nplay the three notes with each aupreset and listen to the end of the sample.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe notes frequency should stay the same from start to end\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS8.x\r\naupreset1 (gender0): notes stay stable\r\naupreset2 (gender1): notes jump up or down\r\naupreset3 (gender2): notes jump even twice\r\niOS7.1\r\nall presets play stable straight notes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8.2, iOS8.1.3, iOS7.1"
