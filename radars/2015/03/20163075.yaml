    description: "Summary:\r\nOn my MacBook Pro (Retina display, Late 2013, 15 inch), I recently started using it with an external display when I was not traveling.  This has generally worked out very nicely, however, because I don't want to waste energy / have my display turned on 24x7 when it is not being used, I have configured the machine to put the display to sleep after 15 minutes of non-use.\r\n\r\nWhen I push a key on the machine, the monitor comes back to life as expected, but after unlocking, all of the windows have been resized back to 3k (retina) resolution instead of the resolution on my display (4k).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a 4k monitor via Thunderbolt/DisplayPort.\r\n2. Wait for the system to put the monitor to sleep.\r\n3. Press a key on your keyboard or move your mouse to wake the screen back up.\r\n4. Because graphics were assumedly rerouted back to the internal display, everything is resized when nothing has been changed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the display has not been unplugged from Thunderbolt/DisplayPort, I expect that there should not be any topology change and thusly my workspaces should be left alone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere appears to be a topology change in the graphics stack, and my workspaces are tampered with for no reason.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite 10.10.3 beta (14D87p), although it happened on 10.10.2 gold master too.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina A1398 Late 2013 with Samsung UE590 4k display connected via Thunderbolt/DisplayPort, using Apple Wireless Keyboard and Mighty Mouse for input, with bluetooth headphones for sound output.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
