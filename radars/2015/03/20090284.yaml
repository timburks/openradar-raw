    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you fail to implement the delegate method the cancel button of SKStoreProductViewController is still active and causes the store product view controller to disappear, but instead of the presenting view controller a white blank view appears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- present a SKStoreProductViewController\r\n- either don't implement the delegate method or don't set a delegate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- SKStoreProductViewController should be dismissed correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- SKStoreProductViewController disappears\r\n- a white blanked view becomes visible\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F5037c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround is to implement the delegate method. However the delegate method is not mandatory. So the expected behavior is that you either tag the delegate method as NON-option to force it's implementation or to fix the default Cancel behavior.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
