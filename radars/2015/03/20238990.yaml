    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Mail.app, VoiceOver can't activate the shortcut menu for the objects in address fields using VO+Shift+M, or by other means.  Thus, there's no way to get or use email addresses in address fields (without hideous workarounds).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Start Mail.app, and open any email message or conversation in a dedicated window.\r\n\r\n2.  Locate the message headers area for a (or the) message using VoiceOver commands, and interact with it.\r\n\r\n3.  Find the header lines, and interact with them.\r\n\r\n4.  Now, use VO+Shift+Left/Right to precisely pinpoint an \"Embedded\" address.\r\n\r\n5.  and try, by any means besides using a physical mouse, to open its shortcut menu (VO+Shift+M).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOf course, we'd like the shortcut menu, so we can see an actual address, and copy it or otherwise manipulate it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt seems to open the shortcut menu for the entire text field, rather than the address object.  This is of no use.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is new in Yosemite.\r\n\r\nThe workarounds include using a physical mouse or Trackpad to secondary-click (VO provides no secondary/shift/option-click functionality that I can find), replying to a message and then copying the address from the quote introduction line, or viewing the message source.  It's almost a pity the workarounds exist at all; the bug is certainly one of the most annoying because I experience it in my daily mailing-list catch-ups, especially those made worse by the DMARC situation, and I could use a designation of \"Serious bug\".\r\n\r\nThe preference to \"Use Smart Addresses\" made no difference; it was off for this report, in any case.\r\n\r\nI use \"Classic\" layout because I prefer table navigation, but it didn't appear that the information in the (presumably) modern layout could be obtained either, and in any case wasn't detailed enough, so I always open new windows to read threads."
