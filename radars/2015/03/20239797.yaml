    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8.2 a bug was introduced where ANCS's PreExisting flag always gets set for new email from Mail.app \"fetch\" accounts.\r\n\r\nThere also seems to be an interaction with Handoff. We've had reports from people that claimed that turning off Handoff worked around the issue. We've tried this but had mixed results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a fetch (non-push) email account with Mail.app in iOS 8.2\r\n2. Connect a Pebble or other ANCS client to the iOS device\r\n3. Receive an email on the configured account\r\n4. Observe that the PreExisting flag is set on the ANCS notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 4., the PreExisting flag should not be set, because the email had just been fetched for the first time by Mail.app and the notification in the notification center for that email is displayed for the first time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe PreExisting flag is set."
