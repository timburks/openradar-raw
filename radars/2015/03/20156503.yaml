    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen rotating a split view from portrait to landscape while the master panel overlay is visible (eg. displayMode == UISplitViewControllerDisplayModePrimaryOverlay), the secondary view does not resize during the rotation correctly and the contents snap into place after the rotation completes. If rotating from portrait to landscape but the master panel is not visible (eg. displayMode == UISplitViewControllerDisplayModePrimaryHidden) the secondary view resizes as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- open an iPad app that uses a split view controller (eg. Mail)\r\n- rotate to portrait\r\n- tap the top left button to cause the master panel overlay to display\r\n- rotate to landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe secondary view resizes correctly during the rotation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe secondary view does not resize during the rotation. Once the rotation animation completes the view suddenly resizes and all subviews snap into place.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIâ€™ve attached a sample project demonstrating the issue. No code was written and this is using the out of the box Master-Detail template from Xcode 6.2. Note the red box snaps into place after rotation."
