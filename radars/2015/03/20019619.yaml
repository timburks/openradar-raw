    description: "Summary:\r\nTestFlight App frequently (90%) fails to display the button to provide feedback even though a valid email address is configured in testflight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install TestFlight on an iOS device (it's an iPhone 6 here).\r\n2. Join a beta testing program (here: GoToAssist Seeit)\r\n3. Go to the App Details view\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccording to https://developer.apple.com/testflight/ \"You can easily offer feedback by tapping the Provide Feedback button in the App Details view in TestFlight\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no Provide Feedback button most of the time (never works for me, works 2 in 3 times for a colleague, ...). There are also others who have observed the same issue some months ago, see e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26851577/testflight-feedback-button-missing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 (Model A1586)"
