        Summary:
        Remote desktop status icons for memory don’t show memory pressure. Instead they show yellow warnings and red errors when memory pressure is green on managed macs

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Set up a lab with 20 iMacs and let them run. Observe them all and see that most end up with yellow and red memory status. Check them and every time, memory pressure is green.

        Expected Results:
        Harmonize the memory pressure colors (yellow/red) with the ARD monitoring colors (yellow/red)

        Actual Results:
        ARD signals trouble when there is none.

        Regression:

        Notes:

        The attached picture shows a system that is reported as yellow - 85.65 % memory usage in ARD.

        You can use the memory_pressure command line tool to apply real or simulate memory pressure on the system so this is trivially reproducible. Making sure that ARD warnings and errors are real minimized stress on Mac Sysadmin staff and lets them focus on problems instead of tools that cry wolf. Also, it feeds into ignorance that used memory is bad memory when the opposite is true - if the system isn’t using all the memory it can to cache files and code, the system is tuned poorly and wasting resources needlessly.
