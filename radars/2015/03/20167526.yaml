    description: "Summary:\r\nSee quick demo here: https://github.com/bsuvorov/ios_bug_demos#ios-navigation-bar-height-rotation-bug\r\n\r\nApple HID states: \"iOS automatically makes various layout changes when the size classes of a display environment change. For example, when the vertical size class changes from compact to regular, navigation bars and toolbars automatically become taller.\"\r\n\r\nIn attached GIF file you can observe how one navbar changes its height to 32, while another one doesn't change height to 32.\r\n\r\nNavbar that sticks to 44pt height is part of second window and belongs to UINavigationViewController that is rootViewController for the second window.\r\n\r\nInterestingly toolbar height does change and works correctly\r\n\r\nThis behavior leads to inconsistent UI layouts and forces devs to remove/add navigation bar as a workaround during rotation handling.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take sample app from here: https://github.com/bsuvorov/ios_bug_demos/tree/master/iOS8_navigation_bar_height_bug\r\n\r\n2. Run it on iOS8 simulator.\r\n3. Rotate simulator.\r\n4. Bug just reproduced\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNavigation bar presented in second window should change its height when going from standard mode to compact and vice versa.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNavigation bar presented in second window sticks to height it was presented with for the first time. if size was standard it'll be 44. if size was compact it'll stay 32.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee quick demo here: https://github.com/bsuvorov/ios_bug_demos#ios-navigation-bar-height-rotation-bug"
