    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Swift compiler currently seems unable to make sense of the following statement which should create a new array of functions of type () -> ():\r\n\r\nvar array = [() -> ()]()\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Xcode 6.3b4 I get the following three errors:\r\n\r\n* Expected ',' separator\r\n* Expected expression in container literal\r\n* Consecutive statements on a line must be separated by ';'\r\n\r\nAs Void is a typealias to (), the following unsurprisingly produces the same errors:\r\n\r\nvar array = [Void -> Void]()\r\n\r\n\r\nInterestingly, SourceKitService on the other hand seems to accept the statement but deduces the type of the resulting array as '[()]'.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following approaches work fine however and can be used as workarounds:\r\n\r\nvar blocks2: [() -> ()] = Array()\r\nvar blocks3 = Array<() -> ()>()\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Xcode project and build\r\n2. The compiler should report the mentioned errors\r\n3. Alt-click on 'blocks' to see the SourceKitService type deduction\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect this form of creating such an array to be valid and accepted by the compiler and produce the same result as the presented workarounds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe compiler fails to parse the given expression.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3 (6D554n)\r\nApple Swift version 1.2 (swiftlang-602.0.47.4 clang-602.0.48)\r\n10.10.2 (14C1514)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPotentially related to rdar://19812302 which is another case of the compiler having troubles with complex type constructs inside literals."
