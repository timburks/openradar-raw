        QuickLook preview are an extremely useful feature in the debugging workflow.

        In its current state, it doesn't seem possible to show the QuickLook preview from the LLDB console in Xcode (in a way similar to "po"), but only through clicking on the eye icon.

        Could you please consider adding a LLDB command to show QuickLook window the same way it is done for textual object descriptions with the "po" command?
