    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are \"Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions\" warnings during push and pop animations.\r\nPop is performed without pop-animation, even though it is called with animated:YES\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached project\r\n2. Press Next bar button to push new view controller.\r\n3. Press Setup bar button which will embed new child view controller.\r\n4. Press Push button on child view controller. - There is warning in console output.\r\n5. Press Pop button. - Pops without animation; also prints warning in console output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPush and Pop should perform with animations without warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is \"Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions\" warning in console output and Pop is not animated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWeird facts:\r\n1.\r\nIf UISplitViewController would not be root one (but letting UITabBarController to be root), then example works as expected.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nIn ViewController.m, try uncommenting line 26: [self setup] and then example will work as expected (keeping UISplitViewController as root).\r\n\r\n3.\r\nIf there would be no UITabBarController, then the example also works.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, iPhone 6+ (portrait)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Bug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
