    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen entering a file path in the Finder’s Go to Folder sheet, the path field (thankfully) supports tab completion.  However if there are multiple paths with the same prefix, Finder picks the first one rather than waiting for the user to add more characters until there is a unique path.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. in Finder press ⌘⇧G to bring up the go-to-folder sheet.\r\n2. Type “~/Library/App” and then press the TAB key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI’d expect (in my case) to have the field now say “~/Library/Application S” with the cursor after the S because I have both an Application Scripts and Application Support folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the text in the field becomes “~/Library/Application Scripts”, which means I need to backspace a bunch of times to get the field to “~/Library/Application S” and then type “u<TAB>” in order to get the folder I want.  This pretty much negates any time saved using that field if there are paths with similar names.  We don’t need a fancy GUI that shows all of the possibilities (like with any decent shell) but it’d be great if the Finder didn’t just go ahead and assume that we want the first match in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has happened in OS X going back as far as I can remember… probably in the 10.0 public beta.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
