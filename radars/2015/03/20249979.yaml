    description: "Summary:\nQuick reply messaging over top of a phone call can pass touches through to the phone app below.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Make or receive a phone call. While on the call:\n2. Put phone in speakerphone mode (Not sure this is required, but that’s the actual usage at the time), and display the keypad.\n3. Receive an SMS/iMessage from someone.\n4. Pull down to Quick Reply to the message - while still on the phone call.\n5. Start typing on keyboard. Hear sounds indicating that the taps are going through to the phone app below, along with to the message reply.\n6. Keep typing. In my case one of the taps hung up the phone call by hitting the call end button (I presume)! \n\nExpected Results:\nI expect to send a message while not changing anything in the phone app.\n\nActual Results:\nMy call got hung up! I had to call the person back.\n\nRegression:\nNA - never tried before, didn’t try on other configurations.\n\nNotes:\nI mentioned on twitter, someone else confirmed they’ve experienced this also (https://twitter.com/mindspread/status/579266044260261888)."
