    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression compared to Xcode 6.1.1\r\n\r\nI'm developing a framework on iOS and OS X and I'm not linking against UIKit on the iOS side. I am using CoreText to do text drawing and when I try and add CTFont to a NSDictionary the compiler complains that the CTFontRef is bridged with UIFont but that the objective-c class UIFont doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a framework for iOS using Xcode 6.3 beta 2.\r\n2. Do not link that framework against UIKit, do not import UIKit from any sources.\r\n3. Create a CTFontRef CoreText font.\r\n4. Attempt to add the font to a NSDictionary.\r\n5. ** Get a compile error** Because CTFontRef is bridged with UIFont but the UIFont objective-c class doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nCTFontRef font = <...>\r\nNSMutableDictionary *dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithCapacity:0];\r\n[dict setObject:(__bridge id)(font)\r\n                            forKey:(__bridge NSString *)(kCTFontAttributeName)];\r\n\r\nCF object of type 'CTFontRef' (aka 'const struct __CTFont *') is bridged to 'UIFont', which is not an Objective-C class\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to add a CTFontRef object to a NSDictionary\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get a compile error when I try and the font.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n64 Bit framework. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nFixed in Xcode 7 beta, iOS SDK."
