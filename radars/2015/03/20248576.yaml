    description: "Summary:\r\nAttached is a sample project that uses regular expressions to scan the contents of a document. Regular expressions are used to parse the structure\r\n\r\nDocument = Paragraph\r\nParagraph = Line LineBreak\r\nLine = .+ LineBreak\r\n\r\nThe project includes the Objective-C and Swift versions of this code, and is a line-by-line conversion. It also has performance tests for each. The Objective-C takes ~ 0.081 s on my machine to parse the entire document. I have been unable to get the The Swift test to finish because it takes many, many times longer. If I only parse the 1st paragraph of the document with Swift, though, it takes ~ 0.2 s to run (instructions to do this in the code).\r\n\r\nThe performance difference is shocking. Changing the Swift compiler optimization to -O (fastest) does not improve the situation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project.\r\n2. Cmd-U to run the tests\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ObjC tests and the Swift tests should finish in roughly the same amount of time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Swift code runs dramatically slower. It's not even close.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3 (6D543q)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is happening on my MacBookPro11,1 (2.4 Ghz i5, 8 GB RAM), in case it's machine specific issue.\r\n\r\n* The sample project referred to here is available at https://github.com/nyousefi/SwiftRegexSlowness"
