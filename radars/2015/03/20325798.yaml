    description: "iWork ’08 was current until the end of 2008. In 2013, iWork versions were released which could not open files from iWork ’08. Instead, they suggested opening the file in iWork ’09, and then re-saving it. \r\n\r\nFrankly, that's pathetic. The software can, and should, handle this itself. File formats change, sure. But requiring your users to use an intermediary app to get access to their data, which is as little as five years old? That's just poorly done."
