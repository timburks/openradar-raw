        Summary:
        On iOS, all applications must explicitly require download of all files they want to have synced to a device. This is disadvantageous for apps that rely on everything being always synced and introduces tons of unnecessary process interaction.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See “Ulysses for iPad” as an example: users expect all their texts to always be on all devices. Most libraries are in the 100MB range. Yet we have to go to great length to request download of all files. Something the system could do *much* more efficiently.

        Expected Results:
        - iCloud containers allows a flag setting whether everything should always be synced.

        Actual Results:
        - No such setting, download requests are laid off to apps.

        Regression:
        Many document-based apps would benefit from that. Seeing how apps like Pages also always download all files, this would definitely make a lot developer lives easier. Thanks!
