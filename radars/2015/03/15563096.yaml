    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's possible to set a higher maxfiles limit with launchctl only one time per boot.\r\n\r\nThe first time that \"launchctl limit maxfiles <value>\" is run after booting sets the limit correctly with any allowed value. Running the command a second time with a lower value works, and lowers the limit successfully. But running it a second time with a higher value does not work, and the limit does not change.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boot machine\r\n2. Open Terminal\r\n3. Enter \"launchctl limit maxfiles 1024\"\r\n4. Enter \"launchctl limit maxfiles 2048\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"launchctl limit maxfiles\" should return \"maxfiles 2048 2048\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"launchctl limit maxfiles\" returns \"maxfiles 1024 1024\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere's a superuser.com thread about this exact problem: \r\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/602139/cannot-increase-maxfiles-limits-on-mac-10-7\r\n\r\nApparently this has been a bug since at least OS X 10.7.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways happens. Tested on a MacBookPro11,3.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations 17-Oct-2014 08:39 AM\r\n\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in OS X Yosemite.  Please test with this release, and update this report with your results.\r\n\r\nOS X Yosemite GM (Build 14A389)\r\nDownload from the Mac App Store\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if that resolves the issue for you by updating your bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nChad von Nau 02-Dec-2014 10:06 PM\r\n\r\nI tried testing this in OS X 10.10.1 and found new bugs instead:\r\n\r\nRunning \"launchctl limit maxfiles 1024\" returns: \"Could not set resource limits: 1: Operation not permitted\" and the setting is not changed.\r\n\r\nRunning \"sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 1024\" beachballs the Terminal app, and I need to hard reboot to regain control over the machine.\r\n\r\nBoth cases can be reproduced reliably. Would you like me to file a new ticket? These new issues are preventing me from testing the original bug."
