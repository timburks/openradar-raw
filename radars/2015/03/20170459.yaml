    description: "Summary:\n\nThe assistant editor in Xcode would be a lot more useful if Swift source files had a way of specifying other files which are counterparts in comments; a bit like // MARK: is a comment which helps with navigation. \n\nFor example in MyView.swift you might see a comment at the top of the file like:\n\n// COUNTERPART: MyModel.swift\n\nAt the moment I currently have to use the “Manual” setting about 90% of the time in order to get two closely related source files to display next to each other."
