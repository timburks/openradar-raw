    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a WKInterfaceImage in your WatchKit App storyboard, and you set the image name to the prefix of an animated image set, the image does not appear; instead, a question mark appears (though the image animates normally).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an animated image set with image names named sequentially (e.g. loading1.png, loading2.png, etc.).\r\n2. In your WatchKit App storyboard, create a WKInterfaceImage and set its Image property to the prefix of those animated images (e.g. “loading”).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image in the storyboard will reflect the image you’ve chosen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlthough the image has the correct size, it does not display any of the images in the set.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be neat if the image actually animated in the storyboard so we could see the animation inline with other UI elements."
