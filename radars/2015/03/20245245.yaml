    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using Apple Remote Desktop to curtain a remote machine at the login window, the UI gives the impression that the curtain was successful. However, the remote machine is still completely accessible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Install Apple Remote Desktop 3.8 on your admin machine.\r\n2.  Make sure you have remote access to another Mac (via System Preferences --> Sharing).\r\n3.  Log out of your remote Mac.\r\n4.  On your admin machine, click the 'curtain' button.  Enter a message to be displayed on the remote Mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe remote Mac should display a picture of a padlock, along with your message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe remote Mac is completely accessible to anyone, although the ARD UI would tell you otherwise.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThis occurs with ARD 3.8 running on OS X 10.9.5 and 10.10.2, with clients running OS X 10.8.5, 10.9.5, 10.10.2, and 10.10.3 beta.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis kbase article gives the impression that this should not work at all: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203251\r\n\r\nHowever, the UI should reflect that.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs with ARD 3.8 running on OS X 10.9.5 and 10.10.2, with clients running OS X 10.8.5, 10.9.5, 10.10.2, and 10.10.3 beta.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
