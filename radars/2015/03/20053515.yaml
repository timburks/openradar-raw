    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a large project that has a mix of mostly Objective-C and some Swift files in it. Breakpoints work fine when set on lines of Objective-C files, but when setting breakpoints on any Swift file, Xcode stops briefly on the breakpoint then crashes, but the application continues to run. This occurs on the simulator and the device\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a breakpoint in a Swift file in a project that includes both Swift and Objective-C files\r\n2. Run application \r\n3. Perform actions that will cause the breakpoint to be hit\r\n4. Xcode crashes\r\n5. Application continues to run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode stops on the breakpoint and allows interaction with the debugger\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1, iOS SDK 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCrash report attached\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.1.1, iOS SDK 8.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CrashReport.txt' was successfully uploaded."
