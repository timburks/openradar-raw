    description: "Summary: Every night when I got to sleep, I plug in my phone, it vibrates twice, and it wakes up my wife. I'd prefer if it just never vibrated when plugging it in, but at the very least it shouldn't happen in Do Not Disturb mode, or when vibration is completely turned off. Vibration is a *noise* especially, but not exclusively, if the device is on hard surface. I physically plugged in my phone, and I can see on the screen that it's charging. It does not need to shout \"WOO I'M CHARGING!\" at me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Plug in iPhone at 3AM.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: My wife should continue sleeping soundly.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The iPhone vibrates twice, noisily, and my wife wakes up either partially or entirely. I feel terrible for going to bed late and wanting a charged phone in the morning.\r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes: Personally I'd consider the fact that this happens *even with vibration completely off* to be a bug, though I get the impression someone thought it was a good idea.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
