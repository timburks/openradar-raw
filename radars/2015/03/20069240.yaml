    description: "Summary:\r\nA presented VC with tintAdjustmentMode dimmed should dim buttons on the presenting view controller's view. Interactive percentage-driven dismissal should gradually undim the presenting view controller's view's button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Run the provided sample app.\r\n2) When you tap Open, note that the \"Open\" becomes black (as it is dimmed)\r\n3) When you either tap Close or make a closing pinch gesture the Open is blue right away, visible through the dimming view \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the more of the presenting VC is visible the more un-dimmed its buttons should be\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- as soon as any part of the presenting VC is visible again, the buttons are fully undimmed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F5037c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nThe TransitionTest sample app can be found at https://github.com/cocoanetics/radarsamples"
