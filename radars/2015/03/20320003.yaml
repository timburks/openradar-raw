    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a horizontal WKInterfaceGroup with a WKInterfaceImage and a WKInterfaceLabel like so:\r\n\r\n|[WKInterfaceLabel]-[WKInterfaceImage]|\r\n\r\nIf the label is too long, the image should ideally overflow to the next line. Instead, it just runs off the edge of the screen, which I can't imagine would ever be intended behavior.\r\n\r\nMore details here: https://devforums.apple.com/message/1117026#1117026\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a scene with a WKInterfaceGroup, WKInterfaceLabel, and WKInterfaceImage, as described above\r\n2. Put a ton of text in the label\r\n3. Image runs off the side of the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should ideally overflow to the next line\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image runs off the side of the screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2, Xcode 6.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Simulator"
