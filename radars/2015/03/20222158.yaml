    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the iTunes Connect App Properties Document (see https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html) it says that status bars should not be included in app’s screenshots, but screenshots for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are required to have the full screen’s size, which makes it impossible to crop the status bar\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead the screenshot section of the iTunes Connect App Properties Document (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html) or try to upload a screenshot without a status bar to iTunes Connect\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document should either suggest cropping the status bar for all screen sizes (and iTunes Connect should allow uploading screenshots without a status bar) or the document should be updated to discourage cropping the status bar on all screen sizes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are encouraged to crop the status bar for 3.5 and 4 inch screens but prohibited to do so for 4.7 and 5.5 inch screens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
