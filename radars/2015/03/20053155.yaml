    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Up\" and \"Down\" navigation arrows (in the navigation toolbar) when viewing emails in an inbox are missing accessibility labels - when read by VoiceOver they just say \"Button\". \r\n\r\nLast two buttons in the bottom toolbar have the same problem: \"Reply/Forward/Print\" and \"Compose\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open threaded e-mail conversation on Mail app on iOS 8.\r\n2. Turn on VoiceOver\r\n3. Select Back button in top left corner (\"All Inboxes\")\r\n4. Swipe right, hear announcement \"Button\"\r\n5. Swipe right again, hear announcement \"Button\"\r\nâ€¦\r\n6. Select the \"Compose\" button in bottom right corner, hear announcement \"Button\"\r\n7. Swipe left, hear announcement \"Button\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nALL buttons MUST HAVE accessibility labels!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmbarassing \"Button\" proclamations when trying to use Mail with VoiceOver.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B446)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou are the shining beacons of hope, the highest standards bearer for all software developers. Get your act together. Fix your processes and never ever ship without full accessibility. This is absolutely embarrassing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s"
