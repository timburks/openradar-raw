    description: "Summary:\r\nRawOptionSetType is primarily used to represent NS_OPTIONS enums from Objective-C. These options sets use a UInt as their underlying data type. UInt is hashable. RawOptionSetType, however, is not Hashable, nor is the type definition of its RawValue property, despite (as far as I can tell) all extant RawOptionSetTypes having Hashable RawValues.\r\n\r\nMaking RawOptionSetType Hashable would greatly improve interoperating between Cocoa libraries that treat NS_OPTIONS as sets of configuration parameters by allowing Swift libraries to collect options in Sets and Dictionaries.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to make a Set of members of a RawOptionSetType type:\r\nlet options: Set<UIViewAnimationOptions> = [.LayoutSubviews, .TransitionFlipFromLeft]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA set is constructed containing the specified values\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nerror: type 'UIViewAnimationOptions' does not conform to protocol 'Hashable'\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs Swift protocols cannot be extended, it is impossible for external developers to add Hashable to RawOptionSetType. Hashable can be implemented on a case-by-case basis, but this is not a viable long-term solution:\r\nextension UIViewAnimationOptions: Hashable {\r\n    public var hashValue: Int { return rawValue.hashValue }\r\n}"
