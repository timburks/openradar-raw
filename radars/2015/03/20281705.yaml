        Summary:
        I can no longer drag a contact into the Messages app to attach it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the Contacts app.
        2a. Drag a contact onto the Messages icon in the dock, or
        2b. Drag a contact into the text field for a specific message in the Messages app.

        Expected Results:
        I expect the contact to be embedded in the message (in the iMessage field)

        Actual Results:
        The drag action is ignored.

        Regression:
        This is broken in 10.10.3 (14D113c), but worked in earlier builds of 10.10.3, and still works on 10.10.2.

        Notes:
        Visual indications that the dragging will succeed still appear. That is, the dock icon dims when dragging a contact to it, and when dragging a contact to the message text field, the green plus icon appears.
