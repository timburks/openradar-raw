        Summary:
        Many UIKit objects have enum properties that can be assigned. When using Swift, Xcode doesn’t autocomplete these until you manually determine and type what kind of enum they are.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Type the following:

        let myLabel: UILabel = UILabel()
        myLabel.textAlignment = .

        Expected Results:
        Autocomplete suggestions for the NSTextAlignment enum choices, for example “.Center”

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens. Pressing escape will say “no completions”. If you type “NSTextAlignment.” it will then suggest the options, but you don’t need to type NSTextAlignment since the property is of that type.

        Notes:
        Getting suggestions here would be a big win for working with objects that have enum properties, as many UIKit objects do.
