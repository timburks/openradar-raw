    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 6.1 -> 6.1.1 update, OS X 10.10.1\r\n\r\nI keep Simulator and Instruments aliases in the Dock, as well as one to an older install of Xcode 5.\r\n\r\nWith the Xcode 6.1.1 MAS update (and a previous one, 6.0 if I recall correctly), once complete those other icons have been removed from my Dock.\r\n\r\nPlease do not mess with my Dock. I have put things there for my ease of access and muscle memory. If the aliases break and I have to re-add them to the Dock, that is _my_ problem. The case of removing the Xcode 5 icon I find to be particularly egregious.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 -> 6.1.1 update, OS X 10.10.1/14B25"
