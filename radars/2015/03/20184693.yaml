    description: "Summary:\r\nMusic.app allows multiple, identical radio stations to exist in \"My Stations\". \r\n\r\nIf a station being added is identical to an existing station, bring the user to that station and open it rather than create a duplicate station and opening it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music.app\r\n2. Tap the \"Radio\" tab.\r\n3. Tap \"New\" next to \"My Stations\".\r\n4. Add an artist station (i.e., Coldplay).\r\n4. From the main \"Radio\" view controller, add the same station multiple times. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll radio stations would be unique, duplicate stations are not allowed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMultiple identical stations exist in your \"My Stations\" section.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
