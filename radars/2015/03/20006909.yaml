    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen signing in to the Apple ID management page, the security code UI that appears after sending a 4-character code to a trusted device, \"eats\" keystrokes that are typed too quickly after the previous digit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com/account/home\r\n2. Click on \"Manage My Apple ID\"\r\n3. Sign in with an Apple ID that requires 2-factor authentication.\r\n4. Select a device to send the 4-digit code to.\r\n5. In the subsequent interface (image attached), attempts to e.g. enter the digits \"123\" by quickly typing the 3 keys for those digits in succession.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo matter how fast you type the code, it should be reflected accurately in the UI and succeed in populating the fields of the interface.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first keystroke is registered, and it then blocks input for a second or so while it moves the input focus to the next field in the display.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Apple_-_My_Apple_ID.png' was successfully uploaded."
