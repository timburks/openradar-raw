    description: "Update: Apple replied to my report, indicating that it is a duplicate of 20219161, which is still open as of this Mar 20, 2015.\r\n\r\n== original report ==\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter installing Security Update 2015-002, AppleScripts that use the eppc:// protocol to connect to other computers fail. The AppleScript itself returns error -600 (Application not running). Console logs it as osascript: CFNetwork SSLHandshake failed (-4)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce (on a single machine):\r\n1) Make sure \"Remote Apple Events\" is enabled\r\n2) Open AppleScript Editor (or any osascript environment)\r\n3) Enter this one line AppleScript:\r\n  tell application \"Finder\" of machine \"eppc://127.0.0.1\" to activate\r\n4) Attempt to compile the script\r\n5) Enter your authentication details in the dialog that appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) The script should compile.\r\n2) Running the script should activate the Finder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSecurity Update 2015-002 installed:\r\n  AppleScript error -600 \"Application not running\"\r\n  Console log: CFNetwork SSLHandshake failed (-4)\r\n\r\nSecurity Update 2015-002 NOT installed: Finder activates (i.e: no error)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested with OS X 10.8.5, 10.9.5, 10.10.2: all three work correctly prior to Security Update 2015-002 installation, and all exhibit the same failure after Security Update 2015-002 is installed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Security Update 2015-002 release notes state that the FREAK exploit was addressed by removing support for ephemeral RSA keys. Apparently these are still needed by the eppc protocol.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe bug does not occur on machines where Security Update 2015-002 has not yet been installed. The bug manifests immediately after reboot when Security Update 2015-002 is installed."
