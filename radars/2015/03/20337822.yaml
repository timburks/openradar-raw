    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease examine the sample project at https://github.com/NxSoftware/Namespacing. It attempts to explore the use of nested types to provide namespaces.\r\n\r\nIt has a class \"SW\" as it's top level namespace, followed by an extension containing a nested class \"Networking\".\r\n\r\nThere is then an extension on the nested \"Networking\" class that provides additional classes \"HTTP\" and \"FTP\".\r\n\r\nFinally there are extensions for \"HTTP\" and \"FTP\" that attempt to add methods to those classes.\r\n\r\nThe idea being that code such as that present in ViewController.swift is possible. I.e...\r\n\r\nlet ftp = SteveWilford.Networking.FTP()\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuccessful compilation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe compilation fails stating that \"'Networking' is not a member type of 'SteveWilford'\" when attempting to build the FTP extension.\r\n\r\nFor some reason it has no problem with the HTTP extension which is structured in exactly the same way.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFurthermore it appears to be impossible to create any extensions of SteveWilford.Networking in files other than SWNetworking.swift of SWHTTP.swift even in ViewController.swift where both SteveWilford.Networking.HTTP and .FTP are used successfully."
