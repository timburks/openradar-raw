    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nBe nice if Xcode would tell me what it's dead-code stripping\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Open a project which has code which is dead-stripped by the linker\r\n2. Build\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nNote that there is no indication of what code has been dead-stripped by the linker.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nIn older versions of the tools (MPW) I could generate a link-map of the application code, and another link-map of the application code with dead-code stripping enabled in the linker, and with some sorting and comparing and such, generate a list of symbols that had been dead-code stripped by the linker.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nIdeally this would be at least as simple as clang's current \"unused function\" detection, which has helped me strip thousands of LOC already in 2015. But I've managed to strip tens of thousands of LOC by knowing that I'll (probably) never need to build a PPC version of Photoshop again, so while clang has been helpful, there's more it could be doing."
