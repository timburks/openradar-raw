    description: "Summary:\r\nA custom type conforming to the 'Reflectable' protocol interrupts playground execution with an EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception when the playground tries to visualize a value of this type by accessing the mirror.\r\n\r\nThis crash does not occur when executing the same code in an ordinary command line project so it seems to be playground specific.\r\n\r\nAn example playground is attached. As well as an ASL log file showing the dumped stack trace.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached playground\r\n2. Wait for a few seconds for the error to appear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis worked in previous releases so it should likely still work or at the very least not crash the playground execution service.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe playground execution fails.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3 (6D532l)\r\nApple Swift version 1.2 (swiftlang-602.0.42.4 clang-602.0.42)\r\nOSX 10.10.2 (14C109)"
