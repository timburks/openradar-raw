    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen writing an extension to a generic class/struct/enum it would be useful to have the ability to specify additional generic constraints so that the extension would only apply to instances of the extended class that also conformed to the constraints specified in the extension.\r\n\r\nTake for example the Dictionary struct:\r\n\r\nstruct Dictionary<KeyType : Hashable, ValueType> \r\n\r\nOne might want to create an extension to Dictionary that only applied to instances for which the KeyType was a String and the ValueType conformed to a certain protocol. The functionality defined in the extension would then only be available in Dictionary instances that matched the extension's constraints.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 - Beta 3 (6A254o)\r\nSwift version 1.0 (swift-600.0.38.7)\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A283o)"
