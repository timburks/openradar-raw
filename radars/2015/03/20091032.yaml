    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a slide with presenter notes is arranged in Outline mode such that it becomes a bullet item on a slide instead of its own standalone slide, the presenter notes attached to the slide are lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new presentation in \"Navigator\" view mode.\r\n2. Add two slides, each with presenter notes.\r\n3. Select \"View\" -> \"Outline\" to switch to Outline mode.\r\n4. Click the second slide in the outline and press tab.\r\n5. Press shift-tab to outdent back to the main level of the outline.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe presenter notes for the item should be preserved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPresenter notes are lost.\r\n\r\nNote that the same steps in \"Navigator\" mode do not lose data because the element is never converted to a list item.\r\n\r\nIt's too easy to lose data this way. The presenter notes should be stashed or something in case the user decides better. On a related note, I would prefer to have Outline mode keep everything as slides and let me manipulate the hierarchy similarly to how I would do so in slide Navigator mode.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.5.2 2119\r\n10.10.3 (14D87h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
