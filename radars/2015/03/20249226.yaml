        Summary:
        GPU switching tends to wreck the AppStore window (and some web views)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Launch a long update through the AppStore, leave the window open
        - Launch a game or anything that will switch from the integrated GPU to the discreet one
        - Quit the game/application
        - Watch the App Store window

        Expected Results:
        Normal update window

        Actual Results:
        Artefacts started to appear, random portions of the screen being placed as textures for parts of the UI
