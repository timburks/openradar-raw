    description: "Reader View already does a remarkable job finding the essence of web pages, removing ads, side bars and social network logos that publishers add via web content plugins.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes publishers and authors add animations as part of the main page content, and Reader View does not give any special treatment to these animations.\r\n\r\nA more pleasant and focused reading experience could be achieved by presenting graphic animations that are embedded in the web page content (such as animated GIF images) in a paused state.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a page that uses such animations as part of its content to add an extra touch of humor (see in Safari, then in Reader View):\r\nhttp://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a5884/one-more-drink-0609/\r\n\r\nHowever embedded animations should not be discarded entirely, as there are situations where they are essential part of the content. Adding a play button that would trigger the animation (the natural presentation of such resources) is desirable.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a page that uses an animated GIF to illustrate the product being described:\r\nhttp://david-smith.org/blog/2014/10/02/introducing-emoji-plus-plus/"
