    description: "Summary:\r\nOn device rotation, keyboard extension’s view is not correctly resized.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nbuild and run the included project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe keyboard’s view should resize on rotation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard’s view’s width remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is new between 8.1.3 and 8.3b2. Also new is that we’re now getting ‘willTransitionToTraitCollection:’ and ‘viewWIllTransitionToSize’ in UIInputVIewControllers (17472132) So it feels like these are probably related? \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere’s a test project included that illustrates this issue."
