    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS 8, Apple allowed developers to create a plethora of extensions to expand the functionality of iOS in many ways.\r\n\r\nOne glaring omission was an extension type that allowed developers of password managers to easily populate username and password fields.\r\n\r\nThe developers of 1Password made an app extension that allows them to populate the form fields with username/passwords (https://github.com/AgileBits/onepassword-app-extension), but such an extension requires developers to explicitly code support for the extension.\r\n\r\nI’d propose the creation of a new extension type, specifically for password managers, and the integration of this with the native Keychain.\r\n\r\nOn password fields, an extensibility icon would display on the right of the field. Tapping that would bring up a Share Sheet-like UI allowing users to select a password from Keychain, or to launch the extension of a third-party password manager.\r\n\r\nThis would also solve the issue that currently exists with passwords saved in Keychain, that users cannot select between multiple saved passwords that are stored for an account.\r\n\r\nThis should be enabled system-wide — including in password fields in Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app (or website) that requires a password that you have saved in a third-party password manager.\r\n2. Focus the password field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ability to fill the password from an installed password manager (with an extension) becomes available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor apps, you must close the app you’re using, open the password-manager’s app, find the account you’re looking for, copy the password, switch back to the original app, and paste in the password.\r\n\r\nFor Safari, you must tap the “Share” icon in the tab bar, then tap the password-manager’s icon."
