        Summary:
        Since iOS 7, more and more apps have multiple themes. A single launch screen can only match one of the themes so if the current theme is different there will be a sudden transition from the launch screen to the real UI, which badly affects user experience. For example, if the launch screen is of the default light theme and user launches it in midnight, the whiteness and brightness during the launch is very obtrusive, especially in contrast to the real dark-themed UI after launch.
