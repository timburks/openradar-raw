        Summary:
        The first couple of times I used the device app container browser (the one accessible from Windows->Devices) I mistakenly thought it wasn’t working because it displays a blank tree grid for around 15-20 seconds before displaying the contents of the app container. It could do with some kind of visual feedback, like a spinner.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open the devices dialog
        - Choose a device from the left hand pane
        - Double click on an installed application under ‘Installed apps’

        Expected Results:
        Either the container contents are displayed pretty much immediately, or a UI element indicates that an operation is in progress

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens for 15-20 seconds, then the app container contents are displayed
