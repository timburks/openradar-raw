    description: "Summary:\r\nMy ISP supports IPv6 and the WAN addresses are handed out via SLAAC and DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.\r\n\r\nIf I connect my Mac directly to the Modem (Fiber to Ethernet converter) everything works fine and and an IPv6 address is set.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I connect the modem to my TimeCapsule's WAN port, the TimeCapsule does not 'receive' an IPv6 address. The relevant settings are as follows:\r\n\r\nConfigure IPv6: Automatically\r\nIPv6 Mode: Native\r\nEnable IPv6 Connection Sharing: Active\r\n\r\nI also attached the full TimeCapsule configuration.\r\n\r\nThe ISP in question is Fiber7 (https://www.fiber7.ch) and as far as I know they are aware of the issue and other customers are experiencing the same problem with AirPort base stations. I am unsure what steps they might have taken as I only just contacted them as well. However IPv6 seems to work fine for customers with other home routers and since it also works fine when directly connected to a Mac, this might be an issue with the AirPort base stations.\r\n\r\nAre there any logs or diagnostics I can retrieve of the TimeCapsule and attach here?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get an apartment in one of the areas supported by Fiber7 (here in Switzerland ;-))\r\n2. Get Fiber7\r\n3. Connect Modem to AirPort base station\r\n4. Enable IPv6\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe AirPort base station should receive an IPv6 address\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe AirPort base station does not receive an IPv6 address"
