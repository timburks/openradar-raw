    description: "Summary:\r\niOS provides a number of built-in apps that are bundled with the system. Unlike third-party apps that can be installed via the App Store, these built-in apps cannot be deleted from the phone, no matter how much one tries or wishes them be banished. (Examples include Stocks, Newsstand, iBooks, Weather, etc.â€”and also as of yesterday, Apple Watch.)\r\n\r\nIn order to be rid of such unwanted apps, the best that a user can do is create a \"Junk\" folder, move it to the very last Springboard page, and deposit all the crap into it in an effort to hide it far from sight.\r\n\r\nRather, these apps should be furnished via the App Store, and the user should be able to delete (and re-install) them manually like any other. As a second-best option, deletion could instead hide them from Springboard, but leave them restorable through some Settings.app module, for example.\r\n\r\nThe status quo affords a hostile, inhospitable, and un-Apple-like user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to delete a system app that you don't want by long-pressing an icon on Springboard, and seeking an \"x\" button.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn \"x\" button appears above all apps, and the user may tap it to delete the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such button appears over several Apple built-in apps. The apps cannot be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll iOS, up to and including 8.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone, any iOS.  (iPhone 6, iOS 8.2.)"
