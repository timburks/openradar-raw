    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode misinterprets xcconfig files containing URLs, because it interprets “//“ as a comment token.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with a build setting, \"MY_SETTING\".\r\n2. On the Debug configuration, set MY_SETTING to https://apple.com\r\n2. Create an xcconfig file containing the following:\r\n\r\nMY_SETTING = https://apple.com\r\n\r\n3. Associate your new xcconfig with the Release build configuration.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMY_SETTING should be \"https://apple.com\" (without quotes) on the Debug and Release configurations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the Release configuration, controlled by xcconfig, the setting is \"https:\". Screenshot at http://bpxl.io/18BkG/3ZSHdDiG. Sample project attached.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nConventional escaping doesn't work. If I write \"https:\\/\\/apple.com\" in the xcconfig, that's how it shows up in the build settings. \r\n\r\nA colleague suggested putting a null variable between the slashes, like https:/$()/apple.com, which is hideous, but does achieve the intended effect."
