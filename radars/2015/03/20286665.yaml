    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 7 introduced new UISwitches, which featured a growing UISwitch toggle that grew horizontally when your finger touched down on the toggle.\r\n\r\nWhen the button is off, and a user touches down, the toggle grew horizontally to the right. When the button is on, and a user touches down, the toggle grew horizontally to the left.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of iPhone 6 Plus, the UISwitch toggle does not \"grow\" horizontally on touch down events.\r\n\r\nAfter testing on multiple devices running the same OS version, iOS 8.2, all devices, including iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 worked properly. The only device that didn't \"grow\" the UISwitch toggle on touch down events was the iPhone 6 Plus.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wake iPhone 6 Plus from sleep using the home button\r\n2. Touch ID or Slide to Unlock\r\n3. Launch Settings.app\r\n4. On the first cell, \"Airplane Mode\", place your finger down on the UISwitch toggle.\r\n5. Other UISwitches you can try can be found in the \"Control Center\" cell.\r\n6. When finger is placed on the UISwitch toggle (a touchDown event), the toggle does not grow horizontally.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UISwitch toggle should grow horizontally. When the button is off, and a user touches down, the toggle should grow horizontally to the right. When the button is on, and a user touches down, the toggle should grow horizontally to the left.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UISwitch toggle does not grow as expected, as it does on other devices (I seem to think this may be a @3x screen bug?) running the same OS (includes iPhone 6 and 5s). The UISwitch toggle on iPhone 6 Plus instead of growing horizontally in length, just moves itself over horizontally. The width of the toggle does not grow, but instead its position on the screen moves.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.2 (12D508)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus, Verizon Wireless, on or off Wifi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
