    description: "Summary:\r\nI was happily typing along, and wanted to move my cursor to the proper horizontal location in a method body.  Usually I control-I indent.\r\n\r\nThis time Xcode is inserting an curly brace.  I have the \"automatically balance\" features turned _off_\r\n\r\nRestarting xcode cleared out the problem.  Thanks to rdar:/20176670, I'd rather not have to keep restarting Xcode.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie with evidence of the misbehavior, and the project it happened in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.2 (6C131e)\r\n10.9.5 13F34\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'extra-brace.mov' (same as) vimeo.com/122562201 and 'Photorama.zip' (just the start of a project) were successfully uploaded."
