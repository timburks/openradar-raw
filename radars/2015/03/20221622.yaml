    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a new contact in the Contacts app (using de-DE as system language) the address format is the US format%3A\r\n\r\nStreet\r\nCity State ZIP\r\nCountry\r\n\r\ninstead of the German format\r\n\r\nStreet\r\nZIP City\r\nCountry\r\n\r\nEven if I enter \"Germany\" or \"Deutschland\" in the country field%2C the format does not change to the correct German format.\r\n\r\nOn iOS this works fine and contacts synced from iOS via iCloud also show the correct address format in the OS X contacts app.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the country code field is never set for contacts created on OS X and so the address format which is dependent on the country code does not change appropriately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
