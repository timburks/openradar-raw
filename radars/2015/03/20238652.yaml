        Summary:
        The save panel grows vertically over successive uses.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Safari, navigate to some page.
        2. ⌘S to open the Save panel.
        3. Resize the save panel vertically to its minimum height.
        4. Position the mouse cursor at the bottom edge of the save panel so you remember precisely how tall it was.
        5. Dismiss the save panel with the escape key.
        6. ⌘S to open the Save panel again.
        7. Move the mouse cursor horizontally so it shows up again (it hides when you hit escape).
        8. Repeat steps 5-7 as often as you like.


        Expected Results:
        I expected the save panel to remain the minimum height (the height resized to in step 3).


        Actual Results:
        Successive save panels are each about a mouse cursor’s height taller than the previous one.


        Regression:
        I don’t recall this occurring in Mavericks.


        Notes:
        In TextEdit, the save panel doesn’t grow on successive uses, but it is always a few points taller than I had set it to.
