    description: "Summary:\r\n“Non Essential” apps that come pre-installed on iOS should be made available on the App Store, and should be able to be uninstalled by users.\r\n\r\nThis would also allow such apps to be updated though the App Store, independent of full OS updates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Press and hold on a home screen icon to enter edit mode.\r\n2. Remove one of the above listed apps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user is able to remove the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user is unable to remove the app. The app ends up in a folder, ignored.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExamples of such apps that could be removed from the device without hampering functionality would be: Calculator, Compass, Contacts, iBooks, Podcasts, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Weather."
