    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an IBDesignable subclass of UIButton, when calling setImage: programmatically …\r\nif the frame size in IB is set larger than the image, it STRETCHES when it shouldn’t.  (Button background images stretch; foreground images don’t.)\r\n\r\nSample code, from subclass \"CustomButton : UIButton”:\r\n\r\nIB_DESIGNABLE\r\n@interface CustomButton ()\r\n@property (nonatomic, strong) IBInspectable NSString *buttonStyle;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n-(void)setButtonStyle:(NSString *)styleName {\r\n    if ([styleName isEqualToString:@“play\"]) {\r\n        UIImage *foregroundImage = [UIImage imageNamed:(@“icon-play\")\r\n                       inBundle:[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]]\r\n                compatibleWithTraitCollection:nil];\r\n\r\n        [self setImage:foregroundImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn Interface Builder:\r\n- Add a “Button” from the Object library to a view controller’s view\r\n- Change its Class to a custom subclass containing the IBInspectable code below\r\n- Add a graphic asset by the referenced name (and consisting of an image something *other* than blue) to the project’s Images.xcassets \r\n- In IB’s Attributes Inspector, change the Button Style to the string value referenced in the code\r\n- Stretch the frame of the button in the canvas to larger than the icon’s actual size\r\n- Once IBDesignable updates, observe that the image is displayed stretched, when it shouldn’t be\r\n\r\n[Please see attached images.  Note that the tinting of the image is a separate issue (#20200040).  To work around it temporarily, type in a dummy string value for the ‘image’ property in the Attributes inspector, then re-expand the button’s frame size in the canvas.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should align in the same way foreground images normally do (incl. how it does at runtime) — and NOT stretch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5, Xcode 6.1.1; OS X 10.10.2, Xcode 6.3b3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'button-image-stretch1a.png' and 'button-image-stretch1b.png' were successfully uploaded."
