        Summary:
        Before Yosemite and Safari 8, you could load web pages in Safari while the display was asleep (such as overnight). Now, the page doesn’t load until the display is awoken, causing those scripts to fail

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set a convenient hot corner to trigger display sleep
        2. Run the attached AppleScript
        3. When the initial dialog shows, prompting you to put the display to sleep, activate the hot corner
        4. Count to 15

        Expected Results:
        A dialog reading “success” should be visible on screen, with the Apple homepage loaded

        Actual Results:
        When the display first awakes, the new Safari window is blank. It then begins to load apple.com, but the script has already failed, and the “success” dialog never shows

        Regression:
        This script used to work on Mavericks and earlier with prior versions of Safari
