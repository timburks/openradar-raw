    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an IBDesignable subclass of UIButton, when calling setTitle: programmatically ... the title shows up *blank* in IB — UNLESS the default value (e.g., “Button”) is first DELETED from the corresponding field in IB.  (The customized title text does show up properly at runtime.)\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n\r\n@interface CustomButton : UIButton\r\n@end\r\n\r\nIB_DESIGNABLE\r\n@interface CustomButton ()\r\n@property (nonatomic, strong) IBInspectable NSString *buttonStyle;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n-(void)setButtonStyle:(NSString *)styleName {\r\n    if ([styleName isEqualToString:@\"edit\"]) {\r\n        [self setTitle:@\"Foo\" forState:UIControlStateNormal];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Interface Builder ...\r\n- Add a “Button” from the Object library to a view controller’s view\r\n- Change its Class to a custom subclass containing the IBInspectable code below\r\n- In IB’s Attributes Inspector, change the Button Style to the string value referenced in the code\r\n- Once IBDesignable updates, observe that the button title being set in code is missing in the canvas in IB.\r\n… Now, delete the default title in IB (“Button”), and see that the programmatically-set title is now displayed.\r\n[Note: The issue does not appear at app runtime.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIB should display the custom title set programmatically when the IBInspectable setter method is called, regardless of the value set in IB.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5, Xcode 6.1.1; OS X 10.10.2, Xcode 6.3b3\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'button-title-1a.png' and 'button-title-1b.png' were successfully uploaded."
