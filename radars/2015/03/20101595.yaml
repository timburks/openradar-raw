    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar:///19145338 which I'd like reopened because it happened again with 6.2.\r\n\r\nThis happened again with the 6.2 update. I have 6.1.1 installed from the downloads page to be able to run both versions until all projects are updated. I now only have one Xcode icon in my dock. PLEASE STOP DOING THIS.\r\n\r\nXcode 6.1.1 -> Xcode 6.2 MAS, OS X 10.10.2 (14C1510)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag-install a copy of the current (to be updated) version of Xcode, in this case 6.1.1.\r\n2. Drag this app's icon to the dock to have two copies of Xcode in the dock.\r\n3. Update Xcode via MAS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe MAS-installed 6.1.1 will be updated to 6.2 and the appropriate dock icon will point to it. The dock icon to the now-\"older\" install of 6.1.1 will still be in the dock so I can choose between them as needed for projects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll non-MAS Xcode icons are removed from the dock, as are any icons for Simulator, Instruments, etc., that I have specified \"keep in dock\" for quick access.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 -> Xcode 6.2 MAS, OS X 10.10.2 (14C1510)"
