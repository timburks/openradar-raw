    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a full screen modal presentation with an interactive dismissal, there is a new side effect on iOS 8.3 when cancelling the dismissal transition at 0%. See attached screen shot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the provided sample app\r\n2. Tap on \"Open\"\r\n3. Start pinching to begin an interactive dismissal\r\n4. Make your pinch wider than the original distance so that the presented VC is again fully visible\r\n5. Lift your fingers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The presented view controller should be visible and cover the entire display\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- An incorrect vertical scale transform seems to be applied\r\n- You only see 7 vertical blue bars at the location of the close button\r\n- i.e. see screen shot\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F5037c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe same sample does not produce this side effect and instead behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nThe mentioned TransitionTest sample app can be found at https://github.com/cocoanetics/radarsamples"
