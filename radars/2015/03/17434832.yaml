    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached playground shows the problem I am experiencing.\r\n\r\nIt defines an array of tuples as follows:\r\nvar array: (Int, Int)[] = []\r\n\r\nThen it tries various ways of appending values to the array. Appending works fine as long as I only use constant ('let' or literal) values. When trying to append values that are declared as variables ('var') the compiler complains about type mismatches.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am missing something here but it seems to be a bug and should be possible.\r\n\r\n(Btw, its very nice though that one can append using both a tuple or using the tuple elements - makes sense as Swift seems to treat function arguments as tuples but still - keep up the great work :-))\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsing variable values to append to an array of tuples should be possible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsing variable values to append to an array of tuples results in compiler errors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 - Beta 2 (6A216f)\r\nSwift version 1.0 (swift-600.0.34.4.8)\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A261i)"
