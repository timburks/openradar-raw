    description: "Summary: Pasting rich text into a new TextEdit document isn't fully undone when invoking Undo.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new TextEdit document.\r\n2. Copy some rich text from a webpage with obviously styled text, such as http://eggfreckles.net/notes/listening-to-less-music/, from Safari\r\n3. Paste that text into TextEdit.\r\n4. Undo (Edit->Undo or Command-Z).\r\n5. Type new text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new text will be in the default text style of the document.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new text picks up the style of the pasted-and-undone text.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've tested in Snow Leopard 10.6.8/10K549, and this bug exists there as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven't tested copying text from sources other than Safari."
