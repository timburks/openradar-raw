    description: "Summary:\r\nDue to the manner in which the Swift runtime and frameworks are linked into app bundles, command line apps are excluded from using 3rd party frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis seriously limit the composability of apps, and limits the use of frameworks for which you don't have the source code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Command line app in Xcode\r\n2. Create a new project for a Swift framework in the same workspace\r\n3. Link to the framework from the command line app and build it\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the app to be correctly linked an run\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"<unknown>:0: error: could not build Objective-C module 'MyFramework'\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 (6C131e), OSX 10.10.1 (14B25)"
