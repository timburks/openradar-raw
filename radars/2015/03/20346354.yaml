        Summary:

        Similar to how Swift includes a native Set type which is compatible with NSSet, it would be great if it included an OrderedSet type which is compatible with NSOrderedSet.

        Currently, if you require NSOrderedSet’s functionality, you must use it directly which means you miss all of Swift’s great features. You can’t create a typed NSOrderedSet, subscript an NSOrderedSet, or take advantage of the mutability guarantees which Swift provides.

        There is a significant downgrade in the developer experience when ordered-set requirement is required for an application written in Swift. This ticket is a request that you please improve it.
