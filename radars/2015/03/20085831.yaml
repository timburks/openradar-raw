    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen tabbing through the Get Info window on a song, if you switch to another app and back, the field you had planned to fill in loses focus\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get Info on a track in iTunes\r\n2. Select the Year field (or any other I’ve tried)\r\n3. Command-tab over to another app (like the Safari window you’re using to look up track info)\r\n4. Command-tab back to iTunes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Year field is still first responder, so you can type the value you just looked up\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo input field is first responder, so you need to tab over (or worse, click on) the Year field you had just selected\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe old style of iTunes Get Info window (before iTunes 12) would keep focus\r\n\r\nNotes:"
