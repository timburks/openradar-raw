    description: Although Do Not Disturb does a great job of silencing sounds attached to notifications it does not stop sounds played in other ways. Our app plays several sounds outside of notifications via NSSound. We'd like to know if DND is enabled so that we can not play those sounds. Currently there is no API for querying the state of DND.
