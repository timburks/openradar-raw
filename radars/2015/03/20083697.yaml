    description: |-
        Press the “volume up”, “volume down” or “mute” key on the keyboard.

        Expected result:
        A bezel shows up indicating the new state of speaker volume

        Actual result:
        Nothing happens for ~10 seconds. Then suddenly the bezel pops up.

        Note:
        After the bezel has shown up, you can press the keys again and the bezels show up immediately. This works for a while, but later the delay is back. (I usually put the Mac to sleep when I don’t use it, so the delay may be after system sleep.
