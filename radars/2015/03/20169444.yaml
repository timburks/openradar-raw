        Summary:
        I would like the ability to drag a folder into the Photos app, and have it create an album based on the folder name.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a folder filled with photos.
        2. Drag the folder to the Photos app side bar

        Expected Results:
        1. When I drag the folder to the Photos app side bar, I expect it to add itself as an album and import all the photos.
        2. I also expect it to create a Hierarchy of albums if there are folders within the folder.

        Actual Results:
        1. Photos does not even allow you dragging a folder into the Photos app.

        Regression:
        None

        Notes:
        None
