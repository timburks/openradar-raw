    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen TextEdit is in the vertical layout (Format > Make Layout Vertical), VoiceOver is impossible to use for navigating or selecting text. For all practical purposes, this makes TextEdit unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on Voiceover and launch TextEdit.\r\n\r\n2.  In the menus, choose Format > Make Layout Vertical.\r\n\r\n3.  Type some number of lines--five of them should do.\r\n\r\n4.  Try to use the cursor keys to read each line (up and down) or each character (left and right) or each word (option-left and option-right).\r\n\r\n5.  Try selecting words, characters, or entire lines (with the addition of the shift key).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOf course, the usual rules should apply: up/down move by line, left/right by character, option-left/right by word, and shift is held to select the respective amount of text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll sorts of nonsense. Shift-left/right seems to select lines, or parts of lines. Left and right seems to move the cursor to the first word of adjacent lines. Up and down skips lines. And using the option keys either doesn't work at all or just moves to the closest word. It's just broken, really.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProblem introduced in Yosemite, and is apparently only specific to TextEdit; every other entry field is fine.\r\n\r\nAppleVis is discussing this issue here:\r\nhttp://www.applevis.com/bugs/osx/vertical-layout-text-edit-causes-voiceover-not-read-document"
