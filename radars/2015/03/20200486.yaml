    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an IBDesignable subclass of UIButton, when calling setImage: programmatically …\r\nif the frame size in IB is set larger than the image, the image does NOT respect the horizontal and vertical alignment properties set in IB.\r\n(This is true BOTH in IBDesignable as well as at Runtime.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSample code, from subclass \"CustomButton : UIButton”:\r\n\r\nIB_DESIGNABLE\r\n@interface CustomButton ()\r\n@property (nonatomic, strong) IBInspectable NSString *buttonStyle;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n-(void)setButtonStyle:(NSString *)styleName {\r\n    if ([styleName isEqualToString:@“play\"]) {\r\n        UIImage *foregroundImage = [UIImage imageNamed:(@“icon-play\")\r\n                       inBundle:[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]]\r\n                compatibleWithTraitCollection:nil];\r\n\r\n        [self setImage:foregroundImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Interface Builder ...\r\n- Add a “Button” from the Object library to a view controller’s view\r\n- Change its Class to a custom subclass containing the IBInspectable code below\r\n- Add a graphic asset by the referenced name to the project’s Images.xcassets \r\n- In IB’s Attributes Inspector, change the Button Style to the string value referenced in the code\r\n- Set the Control Alignment to something *other* than the default values (left/top)\r\n- Stretch the frame of the button in the canvas to larger than the icon’s actual size\r\n- Once IBDesignable updates, observe that the image is aligned or stretched along the left-hand edge, and doesn’t respect the content alignment values (either within IBDesignable or at runtime).\r\n\r\n[Please see attached images.  Note that the tinting of the image is a separate issue (#20200040).  To work around it temporarily, type in a dummy string value for the ‘image’ property in the Attributes inspector, then re-expand the button’s frame size in the canvas.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should align according to the .contentHorizontalAlignment and .contentVerticalAlignment properties set in IB.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is aligned or stretched along the left-hand edge, and doesn’t respect the content alignment values set in IB (either within IBDesignable or at runtime).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5, Xcode 6.1.1; OS X 10.10.2, Xcode 6.3b3\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'button-image-alignment1a.png', 'button-image-alignment1b.png' and 'button-image-alignment1c.png' were successfully uploaded."
