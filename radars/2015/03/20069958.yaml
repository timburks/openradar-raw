        Summary:
        SKReceiptRefreshRequest calls its delegate’s requestDidFinish: method when the request fails due to lack of network connection..

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) disconnect device from the network (e.g enable Airplane Mode)
        2) start a SKReceiptRefreshRequest:

        SKReceiptRefreshRequest *request = [[SKReceiptRefreshRequest alloc] initWithReceiptProperties:nil];
                request.delegate = self;
                [request start];

        3) Enter App Store credentials when promted

        Expected Results:
        The delegate’s didFailWithError method called with an appropriate error passed, as the request was not successful and the receipt not refreshed.

        Actual Results:
        The delegate’s requestDidFinish: called as if the request was successful.

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        tested on an iPhone 6 with iOS 8.1.3
