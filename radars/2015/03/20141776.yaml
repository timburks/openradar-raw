        Summary:
        Because of the way that Equatable is defined, it cannot be used in a variable declaration or as a function argument. This isn’t so bad in and of itself, but if a protocol inherits from Equatable, then it can’t be used anywhere either. Equatable is a vital protocol. There isn’t much you can do without being able to at least tell if 2 things are the same.
