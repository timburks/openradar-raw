    description: "Summary:\r\nTrim Trailing Whitespace while editing is a great feature, but Xcode's implementation is too quick, it needs to allow some delay.  For example, I typically do something like this: type \"x = \", then copy and paste something from another line.  By the time I've copied and clicked back, Xcode has removed the space I just typed.  This significantly reduces the \"delight\" in this feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnable Automatically trim trailing whitespace while editing feature.  Type \"x\", space, \"=\", space, then copy something from another line and paste it in where you were typing.\r\n\r\nI do this dozens of times a day, and so am disappointed by the feature frequently.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.2 (6C131e) / 10.10.2"
