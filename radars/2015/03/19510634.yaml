    description: "Summary:\r\nCoreCursor has been around since 10.7, and provides 43 useful cursors, many of which have no analog in NSCursor, and all of which can be trivially utilised using the private API which no one wants to be forced to use.\r\n\r\nSince NSCursor does not appear to support any public way of doing very high DPI cursors anyway, surely making these standard cursors available should be a priority!?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.7-10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
