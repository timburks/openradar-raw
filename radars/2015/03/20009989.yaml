    description: "Summary:\nA lot of times a user wants to repost a whole album to a shared album. However one does not want to figure out which one that they have posted before. Instead the average person will select a whole album again and repost to the same shared album. This causes a lot of duplicates and a headache for those who want to share photos.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Take a few photos.\n2. Create an album. \n3. Share all the photos in the album to a shared album.\n4. Take a lot more photos and add them to the original album.\n5. Select all the photos in the original album and post them to the shared album.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nI expect Photos (on the iOS and on the Mac App) to warn me that there are duplicates I am about to share, and provide me with 3 options:\n\n1. Post anyway.\n2. Post without the duplicates.\n3. Cancel\n\nActual Results:\nPhotos posts all the photos creating duplicates.\n\nRegression:\nThis occurs in all iOS versions and Mac App Versions.\n\nNotes:\nNone."
