    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently there is no way to conform to a protocol including an initializer in an extension to a non-final class.\r\n\r\nTake the following protocol:\r\n\r\nprotocol Protocol {\r\n    init(aNumber: Int)\r\n}\r\n\r\nNow we want an existing, non-final class defined somewhere else to conform to this protocol:\r\n\r\nextension NSData: Protocol {\r\n   init(aNumber: Int) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is currently impossible. Only convenience initializers are allowed in extensions and a convenience initializer can't be used in this case as the class is non-final and thus the protocol conformance must be inherited by all subclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this would be possible in some way. Perhaps by being able to add non-convenience initializers in extensions or some other way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1030)\r\nSwift version 1.1 (swift-600.0.54.4)\r\nOSX 10.10 (14A361c)"
