    description: "Summary:\r\nMail allows more than 9 \"favorite\" mailboxes.\r\n\r\nMail lists the favorite mailboxes in Mailbox ➤ Go to Favorite Mailbox submenu.  These have command keys shortcuts 1-9.  However if there are more than 9 favorite mailboxes, only the first 9 are listed.  There is no reason not to list the remainder just because you have run out of command keys - the user can use the System Preferences to add other command keys if desired, and may want to use the menu for various other reasons including accessibility and automation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate ten favorites.  Watch them not all show up in the Mailbox ➤ Go to Favorite Mailbox menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.2 (2070.6) & 10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
