    description: "instead of adding a new song/album/audiobook to the iPhone, iTunes Synch deletes all audio content\r\n\r\nexpressions my frustration from my addition notes .....\r\n\r\nRemember the mobile me launch where Jobs reputedly said something along the lines of \"You’ve tarnished Apple’s reputation,” You should hate each other for having let each other down.”\r\n\r\nThe iTunes dev team haven't just stumbled into that kind of territory, it seems like you not only made camp there but decided you liked it and have started building permanent dwellings there."
