    description: "Summary:\r\nI just bought a new MacBook Pro. I set it up, logged into iCloud, and installed some apps. I didn't migrate anything from my previous laptop. So far, every time I've restarted I get an iCloud password prompt immediately after logging in. If I enter my password it prompts me again. If I choose Cancel twice then it goes away.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Restart my MacBook Pro.\r\n2. Select my account and enter my password.\r\n3. Wait a moment.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI shouldn't get a vague prompt for my iCloud password. If I do then entering my password should make it go away.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am prompted to enter my iCloud password every time I restart my computer. If I enter my password I am prompted again. The only way out is to cancel it twice.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 (14C2507)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\n2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB"
