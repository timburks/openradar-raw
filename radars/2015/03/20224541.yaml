    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a WatchKit interface controller with a “next page” segue in your storyboard, the Assistant Editor’s Preview feature should show page indicators on the bottom of the preview so that we can see where our content will sit relative to those indicators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add two interface controllers to your storyboard.\r\n2. Connect them with a “next page” segue.\r\n3. Open the Preview feature of the Assistant Editor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preview will have page indicator dots visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe preview does not have page indicator dots visible."
