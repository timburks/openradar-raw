    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an IBDesignable subclass of UIButton, when calling setImage: programmatically … the image is displayed with the TINT color (both in IB and at runtime).  [This is the tintColor inherited from UIView — even though the image does NOT have its .renderMode property set to Template.]\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nIf the ‘image’ property is set manually in IB, then cleared, the image color returns to normal.  (This might be temporary.)\r\n\r\nSample code, from subclass \"CustomButton : UIButton”:\r\n\r\nIB_DESIGNABLE\r\n@interface CustomButton ()\r\n@property (nonatomic, strong) IBInspectable NSString *buttonStyle;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n-(void)setButtonStyle:(NSString *)styleName {\r\n    if ([styleName isEqualToString:@“play\"]) {\r\n        UIImage *foregroundImage = [UIImage imageNamed:(@“icon-play\")\r\n                       inBundle:[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]]\r\n                compatibleWithTraitCollection:nil];\r\n\r\n        [self setImage:foregroundImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe image should show in its true color — just as it does when the same property is set manually in IB [see screenshots].\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'button-image-color1a.png' and 'button-image-color1b.png' were successfully uploaded."
