    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I accidentally call XCTest.waitForExpectationsWithTimeout without creating an expectation, I get the following error:\r\nAssertions:  failed: caught \"NSInternalInconsistencyException\", \"API violation - call made to wait without any expectations having been set.\"\r\n\r\nThis doesn't crash tests, it acts like an XCTFail. Thus, XCTest.waitForExpectationsWithTimeout should accept file and line parameters so that callers can see exactly where their erroneous XCTest.waitForExpectationsWithTimeout call is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. call XCTest.waitForExpectationsWithTimeout without creating an expectation\r\n2. run tests\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee a failure marker where I called XCTest.waitForExpectationsWithTimeout\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnspecific failure on the whole test method only. No clue as to what caused the failure other than the following output:\r\nAssertions:  failed: caught \"NSInternalInconsistencyException\", \"API violation - call made to wait without any expectations having been set.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C131e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
