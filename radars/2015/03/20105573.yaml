    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using iOS 8 self-sizing cells (tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension and tableView:estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath:) combination. It works great until I start typing something inside a cell. When I'm typing, I'm calling beginUpdates/endUpdates pair to resize my cell (text view grows as I type and shrinks as I delete) but each call results in a bad jump to top of the table view. If I remove the beginUpdates/endUpdates pair then it doesn't jump but my cell doesn't resize as I type.\r\n\r\nWe figured out we could check and only update the table when the size actually needs to change via:\r\n// Resize cell only when cell's size is changes\r\n        if size.height != newSize.height\r\n        {\r\n\r\nso it only jumps when the cell gets bigger but it still jumps. \r\n\r\nI attached the project, also available here on Github - https://github.com/joshdance/TableViewJumpIssue\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap in the cell\r\n2. Start entering text\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the tableView not to jump to the top when it gets resized. Or maybe a parameter to set where I could set a scroll location it would stay at while the table is updating. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalling the beginUpdates/endUpdates pair to resize my cell but each call results in a bad jump to top of the tableView. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator. Also iPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableViewJumpIssue.zip' was successfully uploaded."
