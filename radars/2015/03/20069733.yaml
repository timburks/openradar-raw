        Summary:
        When distributing an app via Testflight for beta testing, an SKReceiptRefreshRequest always fails with SSErrorDomain Code=100 "The operation couldn't be completed.”.
        The error is not documented.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In an app distributed via Testflight start an SKReceiptRefreshRequest like so:
        SKReceiptRefreshRequest *request = [[SKReceiptRefreshRequest alloc] initWithReceiptProperties:nil];
                request.delegate = self;
                [request start];

        Expected Results:
        Receipt refreshed after successful authentication

        Actual Results:
        After successful authentication the request fails with SSErrorDomain Code=100 "The operation couldn't be completed.”.

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        Tested on devices with latest testflight app and iOS 8.1.3

        Others are seeing this error as well:
