    description: "WKWebView cannot load files using file:// URL protocol that is within the app sandbox since iOS 8.0 beta 4 and 5. This worked in 8.0 beta 3, and still works in the iOS 8 simulators (all versions).\r\n\r\nDup of rdar://18039024 & rdar://17761459\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a file in your Documents folder (or Library, or Library/Caches, or tmp, or even load something in your app bundle)\r\n2. Load that file in WKWebView as a file:// URL\r\n3. The file will not load and result in an error\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWKWebView can load a file from a file URL from the app's sandbox (Documents, Library, Library/Caches, tmp, app bundle)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWKWebView will not load a file from a file URL from the app's sandbox (Documents, Library, Library/Caches, tmp, app bundle)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: (hardware)\r\niMac 27-inch (Late 2012), iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6\r\n\r\nVersion & Build:\r\nXcode 6.2 (6C131e)\r\niOS Simulator 8.2 (553.8)\r\nOS X 10.10.3 seed 3 (14D98g)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked in 8.0 beta 3 and also works in all versions of the iOS 8 simulator. However, it has never worked on a device in any publicly released version of iOS 8.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\nThere is a workaround to this issue which is demonstrable in the following sample project:\r\nhttps://github.com/shazron/WKWebViewFIleUrlTest\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to copy the web content to a temporary directory inside the app sandbox and to give the WKWebView a URL to it there."
