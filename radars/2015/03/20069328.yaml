    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UIModalPresentationOverFullScreen instead the default or UIModalPresentationFullScreen presentation mode, interactively dismissing the presented VC first shows the presented VC, but upon completion of the dismissal the presenting VC's view goes black.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the provided sample app in Xcode\r\n2. In the story board change the presentation mode of the segue to UIModalPresentationOverFullScreen\r\n3. Run the app\r\n4. Tap on Open\r\n5. Begin to interactively dismiss the presented VC by making a closing pinch gesture\r\n6. Pinch close enough to fully dismiss the VC\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the appearing presenting VC should remain visible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- the re-appearing presenting VC goes to black after the transition concludes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F5037c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nThe mentioned TransitionTest sample app can be found at https://github.com/cocoanetics/radarsamples"
