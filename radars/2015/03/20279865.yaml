    description: "Summary:\r\nSelecting text then dragging it no longer works. It did work in previous versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select some text in an Xcode code editor.\r\n2. Click, hold briefly and drag.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text is dragged and can be moved to another location, to Finder to be saved as a clipping, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA new selection simply starts.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIâ€™m not sure when this broke. It certainly worked in older versions of Xcode, and is broken in Xcode 6.2. It may have been broken in Xcode 6.1.x, as well."
