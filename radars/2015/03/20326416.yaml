    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8, UINavigationController introduced a new property hidesBarsOnTap, which looks for unhandled taps in its content view and toggles its bars' visibility when it detects one. This is very convenient for providing additional space to the content.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a UIWebView is the content view of the navigation controller, this property fails to perform its function correctly. An attached sample app demonstrates this behavior: even if the content of the web view is not interactable at all, a tap on the view does not show or hide the bars.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app.\r\n2. Wait for the picture to completely load.\r\n3. Tap the picture.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe navigation bars disappear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tap does nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 beta 4 (12F61a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'HideBarsOnWebViewTapTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
