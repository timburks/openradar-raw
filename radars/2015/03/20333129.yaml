    description: "Connor Smith27-Mar-2015 03:27 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you have WKInterfaceGroup objects inside a row controller, the radius is ignored when you set a fixed size for the 42mm and a corresponding radius for the 42 mm. The radius is not ignored if you have a single radius for both watch sizes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS application in Xcode\r\n2. Create a Watch App Target\r\n3. Open the new \"interface.storyboard\" in the WatchKit App\r\n4. Add a WKInterfaceTable\r\n5. Add a WKInterfaceGroup to a row's WKInterfaceGroup\r\n6. Set fixed heights and widths for the newly added group to 30\r\n7. Set fixed heights and widths for 42mm for the newly added group to 40\r\n8. Set radius to 15\r\n9. Set radius 42mm to 20\r\n10. Set the identifier of that row\r\n11. Insert the row programmatically in your interface controller\r\n12. Build and run the watch app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe group will have a corner radius in either watch size\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe group has no corner radius in either watch size\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C131e)\r\nOSX Version 10.10.2 (14C1514)"
