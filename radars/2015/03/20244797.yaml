    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the iTunes Store is unavailable and you try to make a purchase through the iTunes app on OS X, you get a box saying \"Could not purchase ***. The iTunes Store is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.\"\r\n\r\nIf you do the same thing in the iOS App Store (click the \"Get\" button, then click \"Install\"), the button either spins forever without bringing up the Touch ID/Apple ID password alert view, or the button spins and returns to the \"Get\" state.\r\n\r\nThe iOS App Store app should tell users if the iTunes Store is temporarily unavailable, rather than failing silently. Otherwise users think that there is something wrong with their device or network connection, or there is a bug in iOS or the App Store app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wait for the iTunes Store to be temporarily unavailable.\r\n2. Try to purchase a paid app or \"Get\" a free app from the App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp Store should provide a UI that indicates to the user that the iTunes Store is temporarily unavailable, and that apps can't be purchased at this time, like how iTunes on desktop computers behaves.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter tapping the \"Install\" button, the button either spins forever, or the  button spins briefly but reverts back to the \"Get\" state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S Verizon"
