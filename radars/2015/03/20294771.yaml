    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing ‑[WKInterfaceImage startAnimatingWithImagesInRange:duration:repeatCount:], you can provide an arbitrary range of images to animate. Say you have image0 through image360 to animate a circle filling up; you could pass a range of {0, 270} to just animate part of it. It would be nice to be able to specify an index set instead of a range so that animation frames didn’t have to be contiguous.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an animation sequence of 361 images, from image0 to image360.\r\n2. For a given value between 0 and 1, write a function that produces an animation curve for a 60fps animation and the images in step 1, one per frame, each frame in order in an NSIndexSet.\r\n3. Attempt to use that index set to animate the image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a version of ‑[WKInterfaceImage startAnimatingWithImagesInRange:duration:repeatCount:] that takes an NSIndexSet for its first argument, perhaps something like ‑[WKInterfaceImage startAnimatingWithImagesInIndexSet:duration:repeatCount:].\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe only way to animate is using a range, which loses the animation curve in favor of a linear animation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C131e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee https://devforums.apple.com/thread/266213."
