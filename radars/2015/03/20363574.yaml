    description: "The App Store Update list has been presenting a firmware update for my MacBook Pro (17\" late 2011) all of the time and when the update is installed, it reappears in the list immediately.\r\n\r\nMy installed updates list shows that I tried installing the 2.7 update many times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Initially installed the update long ago when I had 10.8.x\r\n2. Upgraded to Mavericks\r\n3. Upgraded to Yosemite.\r\n4. Wait until Feb 2015 when the update reappeared\r\n5. Try to install it again to see whether it goes away.\r\n6. After a month of being irritated by the update notifications, write a bug report.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe App Store should be able to determine that this MacBook already has the firmware update installed and please stop notifying me.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe update will not go away.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApp Store 2.0 (376.6.2)\r\nYosemite 10.10.2 (14C1514)\r\nMacBookPro8,3"
