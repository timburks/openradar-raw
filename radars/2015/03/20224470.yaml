    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter 30 days, apps installed via TestFlight expire. When you try to open them, they just don't open. No message is displayed, and so beta testers e-mail saying the app is broken and they cannot run the app. Users should be instructed to download the App Store version or ask for another beta. Developers may want to be notified that the beta is about to expire.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a TestFlight beta app\r\n2. Wait 31 days.\r\n3. Open the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlert that says the TestFlight beta has expired. Please contact the developer for more information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing (silent failure).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nConfirmed through iOS 8.3b3."
