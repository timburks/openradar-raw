    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to make sure, just like Apple's own apps, that someone hasn't maliciously added an un-approved fingerprint to an iPhone, I need a hook that I can query when the app starts, so that if the set of fingerprints has changed, the user will be forced to re-authenticate against my backend.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open my app (not made yet)\r\n2. Create an account and authenticate\r\n3. Close the app\r\n4. Add a new fingerprint to the iPhone\r\n5. Start my app again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would now like to ask the user to re-authenticate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI dont have any hooks, so basicly anyone can access my apps data, if they have an fingerprint added to the iPhone\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone and iPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
