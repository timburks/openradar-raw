    description: "Summary:\r\nModal transitions between view controllers with different status bars should animate the status bar style and visibility in tandem with the transition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch the provided sample app.\r\n2) Tap on the Open button\r\n3) Note that the presented VC has a white status bar\r\n4) start closing the presented VC by a closing pinch gesture\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The white status bar text should gradually cross-fade to black text\r\n- This cross-fade should be coupled with the percent of the percent driven transition\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The text color changes to black right after the interactive transition was started\r\n- The text color jumps to white if the interactive transition is cancelled\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F5037c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe same problem exists if the presented VC has a hidden status bar. In that case I would expect the status bar to fade out during presentation and fade in gradually according to the percentage during interactive dismissal.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nSample App TransitionTest can be found at https://github.com/cocoanetics/radarsamples"
