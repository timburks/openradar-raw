    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://14202745\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using an MKMapView, it’s possible that the app will be in the background but MKMapView will attempt to call into OpenGL drawing code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app with a method that adds an MKMapView to the app’s UI\r\n2. Create a condition where this code is called while the app is backgrounded\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app will not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes, as seen in this tech note: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1766/_index.html\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis StackOverflow post (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12713781/occasionally-ios-6-mkmapview-crashes-in-initwithframe) seems to indicate that this started in iOS 6. My own crash logs support this, as no iOS 5 devices have reported this crash.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding an MKMapView to the UI is definitely not something we should be doing while the app is backgrounded, but if someone does so accidentally, it shouldn’t crash the app."
