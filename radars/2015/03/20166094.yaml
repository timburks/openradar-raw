    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using LD and LDPLUSPLUS environment variables to override the default linker, it works fine until I added a swift file to the project. When the project has swift code inside of it, xcodebuild doesn't seem to take LD and LDPLUSPLUS variable into account\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project iPhone application project with Xcode (only objective c code) \r\n2. Add User-Defined Setting LD=/tmp/blalba \r\n3. Compile the project - it will fail because it can't be linked with /tmp/blalba \r\n4. Add a new swift file to the project \r\n5. Compile the project - it is expected to fail again, but it will not because it does not use LD variable.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA project with swift code should also activate LD and LDPLUSPLUS environment variables when linking \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnce the project has swift code LD and LDPLUSPLUS does not override default linker"
