    description: "Summary:\r\nHi Apple Dev,\r\n\r\nthanks for your time. I have been playing around with ImageKit and IKImageView lately, mostly by using your Demo Application: \r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/IKImageViewDemo/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\nWith that, I'm easily able to load a random image into the IKImageView and annotate it using the built-in annotation tool. However, I have not been able to actually save the image *with* the annotation I drew on the IKImageView, though I HAVE been able to get the image with the annotations done by using the undocumented API call on IKImageView: -imageWithOptions:. As I'm targeting the Mac App Store, I cannot use this in my app.\r\n\r\nThe documentation says nothing about how to either get the image with annotation or how to get the annotations itself to apply them on the image manually at all, I fear:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/IKImageView/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/IKImageView\r\n\r\nI'm asking you to consider to make the IKImageView: -imageWithOptions: API public or update the ImageKit documentation on how to access the annotations so I could implement this on my own.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Apple provided demo project: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/IKImageViewDemo/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\nGo to: \r\n\r\n- (void)savePanelDidEnd: (NSSavePanel *)sheet\r\n             returnCode: (NSInteger)returnCode\r\n\r\nin Controller.m\r\n\r\nLine 245: image = [_imageView image];\r\n\r\nThe image property does not contain the annotated image from the IKImageView, but only the image without the annotations, as described above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image property either contains the image will all annotations, or IKImageView: -imageWithOptions: is a public API.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image property does not contain the image with all annotations, and IKImageView: -imageWithOptions: is a private API.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.5 and up (according to the docs)"
