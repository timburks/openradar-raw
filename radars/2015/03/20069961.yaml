    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you resize a window displaying a PDF in Preview very fast, sometimes Preview fails to keep up with the mouse movement.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a PDF file in Preview.\r\n2. Select View > Single Page in the Preview menubar.\r\n3. With mouse, grab bottom-right corner of window and resize to make window very small.\r\n4. With mouse, grab bottom-right corner of window and resize by dragging VERY FAST.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Preview to scale the page so that it always fills the entire space available in the window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen I drag VERY FAST, Preview fails to \"keep up\" and the scaled PDF at the end of the dragging does not fill the entire window.\r\n\r\nA further \"nudge\" of the window size is required to force Preview to refresh and properly fill the space available.\r\n\r\nSee attached MP4 file, which illustrates the problem:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/cp0fw3ig2r2uf5j/Preview-PDF-Resize.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nNotice how, after the quick dragging motion to resize, the PDF page does not quite fill the entire window. After a pause, I nudged by dragging the corner a little bit more, and THEN finally Preview finished scaling the PDF page to fill the window. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\nPreview 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem has a very problematic impact on Keyboard Maestro, because its window resize action effectively mimics a very fast mouse movement and is severely affected by this problem when applied to windows in Preview.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2014 Mac Pro with 32 GB of RAM running OS X 10.10.2 + Sharp PN-K321 Display and Apple Cinema HD Display"
