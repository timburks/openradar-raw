    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 8.2 seems to have embraced a lot of parts of the latest Bluetooth 4.2 specification.\r\nOne part that does not seem to be implemented, is the \"Cross-Transport Key Derivation\" feature. This feature is valuable for products that use both the BR/EDR transport as well as the LE transport. An example of such product is are the Pebble smartwatches. When pairing with an iOS device, the user has to pair each of the transports separately. With the new \"Cross-Transport Key Derivation\" feature, only one of the two needs to be paired. The other will be implicitly and automatically paired. Having to pair a device only once instead of twice is obviously a better user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a Pebble\r\n2. Follow the on-boarding steps in the associated Pebble application\r\n3. Observe that there are 2 pairing steps in the process, one for BR/EDR and one for LE\r\n4. Open iOS' Bluetooth Settings.\r\n5. Observe that there are 2 \"devices\" listed (one for BR/EDR and one for LE) even though it's actually one and the same device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Require only one pairing step instead of two\r\n- List only one pairing iOS' Bluetooth Settings instead of two\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee step 3 and 5:\r\n- Two pairing steps instead of one\r\n- Two pairing entries listed instead of one\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
