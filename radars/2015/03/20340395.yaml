        Summary:
        Currently menu action doesn’t provide information of the touched table row even though the visual feedback clear shows which row is force touched.

        Current HIG says:
        Do not create an action that affects only the selected item or only a portion of your interface. Actions apply to the entire screen.

        However, actions for the whole table are almost useless while actions for rows are very useful — they can simulate UITableViewRowActions. Since the visual feedback is so clear users will not misunderstand which object the menus are for.
