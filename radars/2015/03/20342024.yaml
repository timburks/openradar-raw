    description: "When a user hasn't set up passcode on their device, calling the CanEvaluatePolicy(LAPolicy.DeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, out authError) from LAContext will throw out the PasscodeNotSet error as the authError, regardless of whether the device actually supports Touch ID or not. Therefore, it is not possible for developers to determine whether the user's device actually supports Touch ID.\r\n\r\nIf the device doesn't support Touch ID, the authError should always return 'TouchIDNotAvailable' regardless of whether the user has set up passcode or not. This way, developers can determine whether the device actually supports Touch ID or not.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION\r\n\r\nTurns out that someone has reported a similar issue already (#18364575). Here is Apple's reply regarding the issue:\r\n\r\n\"Engineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nIf passcode is not set, you will not be able to detect Touch ID presence. Once the passcode is set, canEvaluatePolicy will eventually return LAErrorTouchIDNotAvailable or LAErrorTouchIdNotEnrolled and you will be able to detect Touch ID presence/state.\r\n\r\nIf users have disabled passcode on phone with Touch ID, they knew that they will not be able to use Touch ID, so the apps don't need to detect Touch ID presence or promote Touch ID based features. \"\r\n\r\nSo..... the final answer from Apple is No. :("
