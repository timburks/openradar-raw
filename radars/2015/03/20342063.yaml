    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have an application in the App Store which uses a UIDocumentPickerViewController to allow the user to select files from other apps. We have included the correct entitlements with the app, and 99% of the time, this all works fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are getting a large number of reports from the field that the application occasionally crashes when using this feature. The crash has the exception message 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Application initializing document picker is missing the iCloud entitlement. Is com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers set?'\r\n\r\nThe entitlement is indeed present, because the application works correctly most of the time.\r\n\r\nI have found through experimentation that testing ([NSFileManager defaultManager].ubiquityIdentityToken == nil) is a good proxy for whether or not the app will crash when attempting to use a UIDocumentPickerViewController. Guarding the call to UIDocumentPickerViewController with this check appears to have stopped the actual crashes, but of course the file selection feature does not work.\r\n\r\nAre you able to provide any guidance as to how to resolve this issue?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOur app encounters difficulty simply by calling [UIDocumentPickerViewController initWIthDocumentTypes:]. I tried to reproduce this issue in a small project but it always succeeded without the crash we are encountering in our production app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document picker should appear and prompt the user to choose a file from iCloud\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes because the UIDocumentPickerViewController cannot find the iCloud entitlement\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nObserved on iOS 8.2 & 8.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nObserved on a wifi iPad air and an iPad mini 2"
