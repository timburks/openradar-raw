    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create a new app and upload builds, before an internal or external build is sent out, the testers tab shows an erroneous build number from a different app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iTC account that has an app with internal and external beta testers...\r\n2. Create a new app\r\n3. Upload a build\r\n4. Select an Internal tester who had installed a build from another app\r\n5. Select an External tester who had installed a build from another app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The \"Latest Build\" column should be empty unless these users have installed a build of the new app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The \"Latest Build\" column for internal and external testers shows a build number that does not exist for this build\r\n\r\nI am attaching screen shots demonstrating this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0.5 (10600.5.9), OS X 10.10.3 (14D105g)"
