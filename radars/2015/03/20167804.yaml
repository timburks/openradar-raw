    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Instruments User Guide, in the \"Executing an Automation Instrument Script from the Command Line\" section of the \"Automating UI Testing\" chapter, provides instructions for running a UI Automation script from the command line. There are two problems:\r\n\r\n1. The instructions are incorrect and incomplete.\r\n\r\n2. Even if the instructions were correct, the process of figuring out how to run an automation script is complicated.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of an actual command-line automation script invocation that works:\r\n\r\n    instruments -w /Users/kdj/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/06995493-FDEA-406A-B9BD-797B812AE77E -t /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/PlugIns/AutomationInstrument.xrplugin/Contents/Resources/Automation.tracetemplate /Users/kdj/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/06995493-FDEA-406A-B9BD-797B812AE77E/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/E37FE608-A0DA-4AB0-8B49-A9985231A73E/KJTipCalculator.app/KJTipCalculator -e UIASCRIPT /Users/kdj/work/iOS/KJTipCalculator/UIAutomationTests/KJTipCalculatorUITests.js -e UIARESULTSPATH /tmp/KJTipCalculatorUITestsResults\r\n\r\nObviously, it is not feasible for a user to type that at the command line. It should not be necessary for users to write complex scripts or use third-party tools to simply run their unit tests.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful if the \"instruments\" command-line tool was updated so that running a script in the iOS Simulator was as simple as this:\r\n\r\n    instruments myapp.app -uia mytestscript.js\r\n\r\nand like this for running on a device:\r\n\r\n    instruments -w <device_id> myapp.app -uia mytestscript.js\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful if Xcode could be configured to run an automation script. Currently, a user can only specify that Instruments should be launched, and all steps after that are manual.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe incorrect documentation for running a script is here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/UsingtheAutomationInstrument/UsingtheAutomationInstrument.html\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
