    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a condition in CoreBluetooth that does not return a sufficiently correct error when a BT peripheral reconnects after it has had it's BT PIN cleared.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPreconditions:\r\n1. Ensure that the iOS -> Settings -> Bluetooth -> My Devices does not have an entry for this BT peripheral.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Set a PIN on a BT peripheral with whatever method is appropriate.\r\n2. Pair this peripheral with an iOS app that supports CB.\r\n3. Attempt to read info from peripheral. iOS will intercept this and prompt for PIN.\r\n4. Provide proper PIN.\r\n5. Quit iOS App.\r\n6. Clear PIN from peripheral with whatever method is appropriate.\r\n7. Start iOS app again and attempt a new pairing with peripheral.\r\n8 . Attempt to read the same info as in step 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCB should return an error here with sufficient info to inform iOS app that the failed read occurred due to a PIN not being provided in initial pairing sequence.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA general error is returned for a failed read. There are numerous failures of CB connectivity that will raise this same error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 and later\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny current Apple mobile hardware"
