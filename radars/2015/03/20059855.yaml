    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new Photos app for Mac does not allow display the file path in the Get Info window. There is no external editor support either, and the Copy function only exports the file at 1024px: which doesn't make for a fantastic workflow!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Photos\r\n2) Click on a photo\r\n3) Right click, click on Get Info\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file path is displayed, or there is a button to show the photo in a folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no file path or button."
