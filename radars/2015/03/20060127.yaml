    description: "Summary:\r\nWith a particular set of structs that contain properties of other structs (that may be optional) the compiler will crash under several sets of conditions with a \"Segmentation Fault: 11\" when compiling with Xcode 6.3b2 (swiftc reports as version \"Apple Swift version 1.2 (swiftlang-602.0.42.4 clang-602.0.42)\"). There are several small changes that can cause compilation to succeed. See the attached source file for more details.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6.3b2\r\n2. Create a single view iOS app with Swift as the primary language\r\n3. Add the attached Swift source file to the project\r\n4. Build the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject should build with no errors\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwift compiler crashes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3 (6D532l)\r\nOS X Version 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Swift compiler also crashes in the current release version of Xcode (Version 6.1.1 (6A2006))\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Breaking.swift' and 'swift compile error log.txt' were successfully uploaded."
