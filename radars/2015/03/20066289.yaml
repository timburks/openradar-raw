    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen converting test suites with many instances of STAssert, I've noticed that a lot of developers used to write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSTAssert(/* ...some expression... */, @\"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trailing string is an empty failure message. Many developers didn't realize you could pass `nil` in order to get an empty failure message from `STAssert`--or maybe they did no, but preferred to pass an empty string. In any case, the current \"Convert to XCTest...\" tool converts the above to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nXCTAssert(/* ...some expression... */, @\"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it would be better if it got rid of the (obviously meaningless) empty string, since `XCTAssert` does not need to be given a second parameter. Therefore it should the first `STAssert` would be converted to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nXCTAssert(/* ...some expression... */);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an .ocunit test bundle that uses SenTestingKit, and includes an `STAssert(true, @\"\")`\r\n2. Run the \"Convert to XCTest...\" tool in Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe call to `STAssert(true, @\"\")` would be converted to `XCTAssert(true)`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe call to `STAssert(true, @\"\")` is converted to `XCTAssert(true, @\"\")`.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.1.1 (6A2008a), OS X 10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
