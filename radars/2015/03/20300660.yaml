        Summary:
        Currently, there is no way to specify that a UIScrollView should use the content height based on auto layout, but keep the width the same as the width of the scroll views frame (or variable width and fixed height).

        Expected Results:
        Perhaps a dynamic constraint that differentiates between the bounds and the frame of a scroll view. Or simply 2 properties that cause the content width or height to match the frame.

        Or even 2 constraints (available through properties) with low priorities that match the frame to the bounds. With this solution, most constraints would just work, as long as it was greater than the content stretching resistance value.

        Actual Results:
        To achieve this, our options are currently to either specify contentSize manually (and update it any time constraints change) or to create a weird constraint where the left and right of a view are set to both the scroll views left and right and itâ€™s superviews left and right.
