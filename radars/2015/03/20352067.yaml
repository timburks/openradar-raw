    description: "Summary:\r\nApple apps have the ability to reply inline to messages. For instance, when you get a new iMessage, you can swipe down on the notification banner (or swipe right-to-left on the notification in Notification Center and press Reply) and type a reply without unlocking your phone. Third-party apps, however, are limited to action buttons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read the Local and Remote Notification Programming Guide at developer.apple.com.\r\n2. Read the section about handling notifications.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a way to include a reply text field in your custom notification handling. Maybe a way to mark a specific category as having one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou may only use actions. Third-party apps are limited to  Reply button that opens the app in the foreground and allows the user to reply.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 (12D508)"
