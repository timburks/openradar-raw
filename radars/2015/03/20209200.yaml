    description: "Summary:\r\nI like to work in a quiet environment.  Sometimes I want my computer unmuted so I can hear an incoming IM or Facetimeâ„¢ time.\r\n\r\nProblem is, Xcode loves to beep, especially if I accidentally type one too many delimiter pairs.  I can already feel I typed one too many, and am already starting to erase it when Xcode lets out a beep.\r\n\r\nI'd love to be able to turn that off, and not have to mute my machine.\r\n\r\nI am aware of PBXBeepOnNoMatchingBrace, but that only works on braces, not parens and brackets.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ntype a )\r\nhear a beep.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI set the \"don't beep at me\" preference, and don't hear the beep.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get beeped at.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.2 (6C131e)\r\n10.9.5 (13F34)"
