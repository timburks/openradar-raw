        Summary:
        When you add a property to your scripting object that returns a list of objects in your app, you can’t query that list in a meaningful way. Using the statement “name of custom property” throws errors, whereas “name of every objectname” retrieves a list of strings.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Decompress the attached sample project
        2. Open the sample project in Xcode
        3. Build and run
        4. Open Test Script.applescript in Script Editor and run

        Expected Results:
        The first two statements log lists of names, and the third returns a list of names

        Actual Results:
        The first two work, the third throws an exception, even though the selectedMyObjects() method returns the exact same type as myObjects()

        Regression:
        It seems that an sdef defined like that has always worked this way, but it makes scripting an app very unfriendly, requiring the second line in my script as a workaround, which shouldn’t be necessary.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
