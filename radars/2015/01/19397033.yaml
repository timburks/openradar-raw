        Within Scripting Bridge, please add some form of multithreading/async support for long running tasks. If only Cocoa used the async/await pattern, that’d be perfect. Without that, I’m seeing something with completion blocks — however we’d need a way to specify a bunch of operations to happen before then. I’m thinking of a situation like where I have about a dozen SB objects that represent messages in Mail. I want to get the body text for each one, via their content property. This is a time consuming operation, as Mail’s AppleScript is slow, so I’d like to do something in the background and be told when it’s done.

        We should do something like NSManagedObjectContext’s performBlock: and performBlockAndWait: methods. Have those as methods on SBApplication, it can handle running its own background queue, and you can put whatever code you want in the block to access Scripting Bridge objects. If the developer wants to do something on the main thread of their app when all the scripting bridge fetching is done, they can add a dispatch_async() inside the block.
