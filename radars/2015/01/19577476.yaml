    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to subclass UISearchController to customize the searchBar. I want it to not show the cancel button. \r\nHowever, once I use this new subclass, searchResultsController controller is not presented and presentSearchController is not called if I implement it on the delegate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project (created from https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/TableSearch_UISearchController/Introduction/Intro.html) and available on https://www.dropbox.com/s/i9n46a87z3qgz4v/TableSearch.swift.zip?dl=0.\r\n\r\n2. Run the project\r\n3. Try to search\r\n4. Observe that the results are not updated, because the view controller that filters them never gets presented!\r\n\r\nPS: The relevant code is on MainTableViewController, mainly CustomSearchController and MainTableViewController.viewDidLoad()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI’d expected that the UISearchController worked flawlessly and the searchBar cancel button was hidden.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUISearchController doesn’t show at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUISearchController is new on iOS 8. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. The docs for UISearchController clearly recommends to subclass (https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UISearchController/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UISearchController/searchBar). Quoting here:\r\n\r\n“To create a custom UISearchBar, subclass the UISearchController class and return your custom object.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2. There’s a post on StackOverflow from an Apple iOS Frameworks Engineer stating that it’s a bug (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25904213/custom-uisearchbar-with-uisearchcontroller/25940619#25940619).\r\n\r\n3. I’d like to replicate the behavior from App Store.app on iPhone, where I have a tab just for search. Notice that it doesn’t show the cancel button in any button.\r\n\r\n4. I can get the expected result by using UISearchDisplayController, which I believe is what App Store.app is using.\r\n\r\n5. This bug was filled after DTS #616849108 (requested by the engineer involved)."
