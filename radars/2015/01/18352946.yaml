    description: "Summary:\r\nThe menubar displays random junk instead of transparency on the right edge of an inactive screen when multiple monitors are configured.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure multiple monitors.\r\n2. Look at the right edge of the menubar of the inactive screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe transparency for the menubar should take into account the background of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's random junk displayed. See the attached Menubar_Photo.jpg â€” the white gradient that's shown is not a part of the background image (which is a solid blue.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 Beta 2 (6A1030) / OS X 10.10 (14A361c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can't take a screenshot of this state. As soon as you try to, you get the correct pixels. The attached Menubar_Screenshot.png file contains an image created using CGWindowListCreateImage().\r\n\r\nThere are two 30\" screens (each is 2560x1600) in my configuration. The graphics cards are NVIDIA GeForce GT 120. A system report is attached (Mac Pro.spx)"
