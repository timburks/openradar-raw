    description: "Summary:\r\nAs of iOS 8/Xcode 6, an app to which I've heretofore linked the ExternalAccessory framework now triggers these warnings in the Capabilities tab (see attached screenshot):\r\n\r\n✔︎ Link ExternalAccessory.framework\r\n❗️ Add the Wireless Accessory Configuration\" entitlement to your App ID\r\n❗️ Add the Wireless Accessory Configuration\" entitlement to your entitlements file\r\n\r\nI'm not using the ExternalAccessory.framework for wireless accessory configuration; it supports bluetooth and directly-connected devices, too. I don't think it should show this warning or automatically switch on this capability.\r\n\r\nIf I remove this capability, it removes the ExternalAccessory.framework from the list of Linked Frameworks and Libraries. If I add it again, it will not again add the warnings to the Capabilities tab. I guess it's because SystemCapabilities/com.apple.WAC/enabled is now set to 0 in the project.pbxproj file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new project\r\n* Add the ExternalAccessory.framework to the list of Linked Frameworks and Libraries.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Wireless Accessory Configuration capability should not be turned on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Wireless Accessory Configuration capability is turned on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nObserved in Xcode 6.1 (6A2008a) and the 6.2 beta (6C107a).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-01-21 at 5.25.22 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
