    description: "With iOS 8, Spotlight Search gained the possibility to use Bing search results and suggestions in it's results.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work when the currently selected language is not the primary language for the currently selected region (see steps to reproduce).\r\n\r\nThe options are available in the Spotlight settings, but enabling them doesn't change anything, the options are reset once the screen is changed back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set system language to \"English\".\r\n2. Select \"Germany\" as region\r\n3. Go to Spotlight settings (General -> Spotlight Search)\r\n4. Activate \"Spotlight Suggestions\" and \"Bing Web Results\"\r\n5. Tab on \"< General\" to leave this screen\r\n6. Head back to \"Spotlight Settings\" and notice that both options are deactivated again (edit: This behavior seems to have been fixed in a recent update, yet this applies only to the deselection of the entries - no search results are pulled with this configuration).\r\n7. Try out a Spotlight Search e.g. for \"Lego Movie\"\r\n8. Notice that no web search results or iTunes results are displayed\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWeb results and suggestions should be fetched with the given language (e.g. US iTunes Store or english Wikipedia with language set to English) and displayed in the search results instead of relying on the region setting and silently deactivating the feature again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe option settings are automatically deactivated, spotlight searches don't use Bing Web Results or Suggestions at all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt might be advisable to introduce a separate setting for this (e.g. \"Spotlight Language\" or \"Spotlight Region\") as many people like to set their Phone to one language while residing in a different country and e.g. also use english language Wikipedia for the higher article quantity and quality or to play games with their original voiceover.\r\n\r\nIn any case Spotlight shouldn't \"silently\" deactivate this new feature without any hint as to why.\r\n\r\nEdit: This issue applies to OS X as well - if region and language aren't matched, new Spotlight features aren't working."
