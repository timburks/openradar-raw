        Summary:
        When network conditions change across a sleep event with the simulator running (and debugging, in most cases, though I haven’t tested if this is required), the simulator loses network connectivity.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In network condition one (home wifi, for example), launch the simulator by debugging an application.
        2. Put host computer to sleep.
        3. Bring computer to network condition 2 (work wifi, for example, with the home wifi no longer reachable).
        4. Wake the computer from sleep.
        5. Continue using the simulator, attempting to make a network request.

        Expected Results:
        The network will have transparently changed, allowing continued connectivity from the simulator.

        Actual Results:
        After switching to the new network condition, every request fails with an NSURLErrorDomain error code -1005.

        Notes:
        Restarting the simulator in the new network conditions causes this issue to go away. Perhaps it’s related to how the host network is bridged to the simulator?
