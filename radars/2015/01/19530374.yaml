    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen submitting a build to TestFlight for Internal testing, the uploaded binary enters a \"Processing\" state. In some cases, the binary may stick in this state for hours on end, with no insight into why the process is held up. \r\n\r\nOnce a build has been successfully processed, it may also sit waiting in the \"Invite Testers\" state until the developer logs in to iTunes Connect and edits some of the metadata, then clicking the Save button to trigger the email / APNS push to testers.\r\n\r\nThe above behaviour is unpredictable and is a huge inconvenience, especially in cases where sending out builds to internal testers in a timely manner is of utmost importance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an app with TestFlight Internal testers.\r\n2. Submit a build for internal testing via Xcode Organiser.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild sits in \"Processing\" for a short time, before pushing out notification emails and APNS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild may sit in \"Processing\" status for hours. After processing, it may also sit idly in the \"Invite Testers\" state until some unrelated metadata is edited in iTC.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X - all versions\r\nTested in Safari & Chrome.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSometimes, editing the app metadata (e.g. What to Test? or Contact Info) can kick the app out of the Processing state."
