    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a password to unlock iPad, sometimes the text insertion point does not appear in the password text box and the keyboard is unresponsive to touches.\r\n\r\nThis happens rarely, maybe about 1 time in 15. Enough to be noticeable, not enough for me to have been able to recognise a patter of exactly when it does or does not occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. iPad requires a password to unlock.\r\n2. Press the power button to sleep the iPad.\r\n3. Press the home button to wake the iPad.\r\n4. Swipe to the right to show keyboard.\r\n5. Type the password on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeypresses are registered, the password unlocks the iPad.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRarely, maybe about 1 time in 15, the keyboard registers no touches. No insertion point or dots appear in the text field, no keys are highlighted when touched.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad Air (Model MD787B/A)\r\niOS 8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn unresponsive keyboard does accept swipes left to show the lock screen again. Swiping to the right once more usually does result in a properly working keyboard."
