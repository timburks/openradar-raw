        Summary:
        When editing an appointment note which contains a character that needs to be escaped, the \ is visible.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a Genius Bar appointment
        2. In the note for the appointment, type `15” Macbook Pro`.
        3. Save the appointment.
        4. Edit the appointment’s note.

        Expected Results:
        I expect the appointment’s note text field to say `15” Macbook Pro`.

        Actual Results:
        The text field has a \ inserted: `15\” Macbook Pro`.

        Notes:
        This is a rookie mistake.
