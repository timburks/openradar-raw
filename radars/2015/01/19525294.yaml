        Summary:
        I’m trying to overload but Swift thinks I’m trying to override.

        My use case: XCTestCase has a method named measureBlock taking (() -> ())!. My XCTestCase subclass has a method named measureBlock taking Int -> () which calls the () -> () one passing in { block(n) } with some n.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Write this code:

        @objc class A {
        	func f(x: () -> ()) {}
        }

        class B: A {
        	func f(x: Int -> ()) {}
        }



        Expected Results:
        I expected this to work.


        Actual Results:
        Error:

        ./overload-ride.swift:8:7: error: overriding method with selector 'f:' has incompatible type '(Int -> ()) -> ()'
        ./overload-ride.swift:4:7: note: overridden declaration here has type '((() -> ())) -> ()'


        Regression:
        Only occurs if the superclass is @objc; pure Swift classes are fine.


        Notes:
        Have a lovely day! <3
