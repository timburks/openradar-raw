    description: "Summary:\nFailures of Time Machine to back up a server do not get pushed or emailed.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSet up a Mac Mini with OS X 10.10.1 Build 14B25\nInstall Server 4.0.3 Build 14S350\nConnect a Time Capsule in bridge mode / network off physically via ethernet to a switch.\nConnect the Mac Mini to the same switch with ethernet and configure the network so they can see each other.\nConfigure email and/or push notifications in server app and select Time Machine in the list.\nSet up Time Machine on to back up the Mac Mini to the Time Capsule and let it run for a day to get several backups complete.\ndisconnect the ethernet cable to the Time Capsule\nLet the Mac fail to back up for days or a week\n\nExpected Results:\nNo alerts are sent \n\nActual Results:\nAlerts should be sent when a working Time Machine setup has errors \n\nRegression:\nunknown\n\nNotes:\nsee screen shot. The Time Machine service seems to alert OK in server app. Alerts are great when a disk fails on server, however losing backups is also a critical problem for a server in production. Please implement this change / fix this bug as needed."
