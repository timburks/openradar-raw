    description: "Summary:\r\nThe WWDC14 video on iOS 8 frameworks recommends single-project, multiple target workflows for app-framework bundles, but that of course isn't possible for so many distributed projects that use multiple internal and external (FOSS/GitHub/etc) repositories. This bug details one of a few problems when trying to replicate framework embed builds using a multi-project workspace.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious/discoverable method for adding Embedded Binaries from a framework project in a workspace to a separate app project in the same workspace does not work as expected. A series of steps is required before Xcode will even acknowledge the external framework.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a \"Single View App\" iOS template, App.xcodeproj\r\n2. Create a \"Cocoa Touch Framework\" template, Framework.xcodeproj\r\n3. Create a Workspace, e.g. Workspace.xcworkspace\r\n4. Drag the two xcodeproj's into the workspace.\r\n5. Select the App project from the workspace window, and go to the General settings for the App target.\r\n6. Under \"Embedded Binaries\", hit + and try to add the Framework.framework file listed under the Framework project (see EmbeddedBinaries-start.png)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the framework to be added.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. Xcode seems to want an explicit file reference to the framework in the current project before it can link.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 (6C107a) / OS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe easiest way to straighten this out is to first add the external framework to Linked Frameworks, then select that reference under App (as opposed to the one under Framework - see EmbeddedBinaries-Workaround.png). That has its own problems, however, which I will link to another Radar on that once I've filed it.\r\n\r\nIt's much better if you perform these steps yourself to see how awkward the flow is, but for technical / state reference, you can download or checkout the WorkspaceEmbed branch of my radars repo on GitHub:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/drance/radars/tree/WorkspaceEmbed\r\n\r\nIt has both Broken and Fixed variants for easy diffing of the two App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj files (the only file that needs to be changed.)"
