    description: "Summary:\r\nNOTE: I didn't try to reproduce this or narrow down circumstances surrounding it because of the troubling nature of the bug being directly tied to making real-life phone calls from my phone. Doing the kind of analysis I would normally make with a bug would require a lot of false-dials of phone numbers, irritating people I don't want to irritate, or else contriving fake pages with embedded phone numbers leading to known dead-ends. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I have to imagine Apple is in a better position to test dialing functionality on the phone in a way that doesn't require dialing actual numbers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHere's what happened to me:\r\n\r\n1. I discovered there was a live hawk flying around my back porch, trapped by screens on every side.\r\n\r\n2. I Googled the local animal rescue on my iPhone, tapped the phone number, and placed a call.\r\n\r\n3. I resumed dealing with the situation, and in case you're curious, managed to free the hawk by tearing open the screen with a gardening tool, and then prodding it to escape by tapping the other end of the porch.\r\n\r\n4. I decided to call the animal rescue team back, so that they wouldn't feel obliged to follow up on the report.\r\n\r\n5. I tapped the \"Phone\" app icon to open the Phone app.\r\n\r\n6. I tapped the \"Keypad\" icon at the bottom to bring up the dial pad.\r\n\r\n7. I tapped the green \"dial\" icon, TRUSTING that the implicit behavior, \"redial the last number I dialed on this phone\" would hold true.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected that the last number I dialed, the number for the local animal rescue which I had Googled, tapped, and dialed a half hour ago, would be called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a few rings, I was connected to Upper Crust Pizza and Pasta in Santa Cruz, California. As it happens, this was the last telephone number I had explicitly dialed from my phone, several weeks ago. I don't use my phone much.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's a delay in adding the phone number, dialed by tapping in Safari, to my recent calls list, or if it was never added. In the fury of the moment I looked up the number again and dialed it again, without taking time to work out the details of why the iPhone didn't work.\r\n\r\nAll I know is it it didn't work, and I ended up calling a pizza place I hadn't called in weeks, instead of the animal rescue I had called 30 minutes prior.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 US Verizon 64GB."
