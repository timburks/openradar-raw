        Summary:
        UIKeyCommand shortcuts only register after skipping the first time

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Subclass UIApplication
        2. Override -keyCommands to add some other key command.
        3. Override -sendAction:to:from:forEvent: and run the method if applicable.

        Expected Results:
        The method should be invoked every time the shortcut is pressed.

        Actual Results:
        The method is only invoked after skipping the first time, works every time after that.

        Regression:
        Repros in iOS 8.1 simulator and device.
