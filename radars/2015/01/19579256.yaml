    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an enum with an associated struct value is passed as a parameter to a function, in certain circumstances the compiler will incorrectly pop the parameter off the stack, leading a to a Bad Access crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project on an iPhone 5S with iOS 8.1.2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should show blank screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes when the function “f” is called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe crash does not happen in the simulator. I did not test other devices or different iOS versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe crash will not occur if one of the following is changed:\r\n  * use associated class value instead of struct\r\n  * function “f” returns Void instead of a tuple\r\n  * enum has only one associated value\r\n  * struct only has one property\r\n\r\nSo it is a very fragile combination of events that causes the crash. In my app, I changed the structs to classes as a workaround."
