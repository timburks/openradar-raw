        Summary:
        After a reset the iOS simulator always restarts in portrait orientation. This is frustrating when developing an app that requires testing in landscape as after every reset the device needs to be rotated again.

        Itâ€™d be really handy to be able to set a preference as to which orientation the simulator should default to when launched, after a reset, etc.
