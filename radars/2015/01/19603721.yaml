    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://17265615\n\nSummary:\r\nIt seems like everyone is reinventing the wheel on text loups. There is one on UIKit, one in CorePDF, one in iBooks, one in iWorks and I'm pretty sure that there's a custom one in Safari as well. \r\n\r\nThis is a lot of redundant code... and we're not even talking about 3rd party apps that usually do a bad job at replicating these. It requires a custom window and a lot of know-how.\r\n\r\nThis should be solved by Apple.\r\n\r\n(See https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers/blob/master/PrivateFrameworks/CorePDF.framework/UIPDFMagnifierController.h for example)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBrowse the UIKit API. Find no UILoupeView.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUILoupeView (or window? controller?)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAPI is not public (and will also have to be refined)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 DP1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
