    description: "Summary:\r\nWindows don't repaint correctly over a VNC connection. Portions of windows don't redraw and pieces of other windows are left around on screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a system running 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n2. Use it for awhile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe windows should repaint correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEventually the windows will fail to repaint.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround is to disable beam sync in Quartz Debug. After the beam sync is disabled, the windows repaint correctly.\r\n\r\nNote that I can't take a screenshot of this because doing so causes all the corrupted windows to repaint.\r\n\r\nThis problem looks like the same thing that happens when using a virtual machine (like VMware) on Yosemite: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/improving-yosemite-vm-performance-in-vmware-fusion/\r\n\r\nBoth my wife and I do tech support for the other members of our family using Screen Sharing. Until this bug gets fixed, no one in our family will be updating to Yosemite."
