        Sometimes I want to drop down to AppleScriptObjC. AppleScriptObjC has its own issues (mainly related to tooling: Xcode is nowhere near as good at handling AppleScript code as it is ObjC), but some things are just easier to do in Applescript.

        My normal use case is to make a new class in ASOC, write a method that does the processing I want, then call that method from my ObjC code, passing in parameters to give it data. For example, this method definition:

        	on moveTaskID_toProjectID_(taskID, projectID)
        		tell application "OmniFocus"
        			set myTask to task id (taskID as string) of default document
        			set myProj to project id (projectID as string) of default document
        			if myTask's containing project ≠ myProj then
        				move myTask to end of tasks of myProj
        			end if
        		end tell
        	end moveTaskID_toProjectID_

        As you can see, in the above method I’m taking IDs as strings, and using those strings to obtain the AppleScript objects I want.

        There should be bridging between Scripting Bridge and AppleScriptObjC objects. For example, I should be able to have a Scripting Bridge object of class OmniFocusTask (let’s call it ofTask), pass it into an AppleScriptObjC method, then do this:

        	set myTask to (ofTask as task)

        And it would magically convert the Cocoa Scripting Bridge object into the native AppleScript object it represents. This would make things SOOO much easier when writing mixed Cocoa and Applescript applications! (Actually, the problem is more than just convenience. OmniFocus supports object IDs, but apps like Mail do not, so I can’t even use this workaround.)

        Casting the other way would also be lovely.
