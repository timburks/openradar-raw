    description: "Summary:\r\nA text based filter on the current view, set by the search field in the top right corner, is not reseted if the view is changed to e.g. a different playlist or a completely different type of media.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to media type Music\r\n2. Select view \"Songs\"\r\n3. Search for a term, e.g. \"Beatles\" in the search field\r\n4. do not select an item from the drop down, but press enter to filter on the string directly\r\n5. change to a different media type, e.g. TV Shows\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch field should be emptied, all TV Shows should be shown.\r\n\r\nReason for this expectation:\r\nI cannot foresee a scenario in which a user searches for a specific term in Music and after changing to a completely different media type still wants to have the view reduced to results matching this search term.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsearch is still active, list of TV Shows is reduced to any entry that has the search term in its metadata.\r\n\r\nUser freaks out for a few seconds and thinks iTunes deleted nearly all/all (depending on the search term) content of its library (I know the behaviour and still freak out twice a day)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.1\r\niTunes 12.0.1.26\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would even argue that only changing to a different playlist should completely reset the search, but I could see a possible use case in this behaviour, so I didn't want to force the issue. If you agree, please fix it so that the search gets reseted after a different playlist in the same Media type is activated.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMy configuration is with list view (Songs, Movie List, Episode List) and Playlist view activated in all media types, but the behaviour seems to be identical in all configurations (at least the ones I've tried)."
