    description: "Link to project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1sf27na0nj0c0m2/Test.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you are in an Action Extension in a navigation controller and you swipe from the left using the interactive pop gesture and stop halfway and rotate the device, rotation will happen and the layout is completely broken.\r\n\r\nThe same on a normal app does not happen, rotation does not happen. The pop will get canceled and then the rotation will happen\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen my attachment and build it\r\nGo to Photos app and select a photo and tap the TestActionExtension action extension (you will have to enable it)\r\nTap the \"Test\" cell so that it pushes a view controller and you can do the interactive pop gesture to pop the top view controller (the swipe from the left)\r\nIf you stop half way, still holding the screen and rotate the device the layout is now completely broken. Sometimes even nav bar button items won't work anymore.\r\nThe same does not happen on the \"Test\" app in the same project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected it to behave like the main app, where rotation does not happen and pop is canceled and rotation happens afterwards.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRotation happens as you rotate (while still holding the screen) and then the layout is completely broken.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
