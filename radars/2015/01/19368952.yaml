    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the past, I had an account on an Exchange server, and had configured Mail to fetch messages from that account. The account was deleted, but I never removed it from Mail; now, I've had that account recreated, and have updated Mail's stored credentials appropriately. Whenever I try to fetch mail from that account, it crashes, reporting that the root folder ID has changed.\r\n\r\n(The use case, in case it's relevant: I graduated college and had my student email account removed, but am now teaching a course at that college and so had the email account recreated.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure Mail to connect to an Exchange account.\r\n2. Fetch messages from that account. Store them locally.\r\n3. Delete the Exchange account. Leave Mail configured.\r\n4. Recreate the Exchange account with the same username.\r\n5. Attempt to fetch messages from that account with Mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail should fetch new messages. If it's necessary to prompt me to archive or otherwise store old messages before doing so, that's fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\nMail Version 8.1 (1993)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air, 13-inch, mid 2013\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'mail-root-folder-id-changed.crash' was successfully uploaded."
