    description: We’d like to request the ability to customize the launch screen appearance for a WatchKit app. Right now the launch screen appears as just the App title and App icon. We’d love some flexibility on this, along the same lines as the new Storyboard based launch screens on iOS. We’d love to be able to define a page in our Storyboard that represents the launch screen for our WatchKit app.
