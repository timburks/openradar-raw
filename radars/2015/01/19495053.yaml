    description: "Summary:\r\nOften when I'm recording a voice message, I get cut off after speaking for around 10-15 seconds. This happens to several of my friends too, so I know it's not my device. This results in a horrible user experience, as sometimes I don't even notice and just keep talking for several minutes only to find that the first 10 seconds were recorded. Even worse, when it happens, it happens over and over again, so I can try 7 times to record a 30-second voice message and it'll only get the first 10 seconds every time.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Hold the phone to your ear to record a voice message; I don't think I've seen the cut off happen here\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Messages app\r\n2. Open a thread\r\n3. Press and hold the Voice Message button\r\n4. Speak for more than 10 seconds (for instance, try leaving a message of more than a minute, because my friends and I often send messages to each other that are several minutes long)\r\n5. After around 10-15 seconds, sometimes the app will just stop recording\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to record as long of a voice message as I want without the app cutting me off\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app often cuts me off at around 10 seconds"
