    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you are using TestFlight to distribute beta builds, and have the same external testers on more than one app, the \"Latest build\" column in the \"Prerelease > External Testers\" page will show the build number of the last app they downloaded, regardless of which app your are currently viewing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create and start beta testing on more than one app (App A and App B) on the same developer account.\r\n2. Start beta testing on both apps, using different build numbers for App A and App B.\r\n3. Invite the same External Tester email to both beta releases.\r\n4. Accept the invitation and install App A on the External Tester's device.\r\n5. In iTunes Connect, navigate to App B > Prerelease > External Testers. \r\n6. Look at the \"Latest build\" column for the External Tester.  It will show the build number for App A, or whatever other of your betas they downloaded last...regardless of the fact that you are looking at App A.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Latest build\" column for External Testers should reflect only the latest build of the app who's tester list you are currently viewing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Latest build\" number for a completely different app is shown, if it is the last one they installed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
