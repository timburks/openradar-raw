    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a view modally using the Form Sheet presentation style, the preferredContentSize is not respected after device rotation.  Only tested on iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached project.\r\n1)  Have View Controller (let’s call it VCA) present another view controller (let’s call it VCB) modally.\r\n2)  Set the presentation Style to Form Sheet\r\n3)  In VCB, set the preferred content Size.  In the attached example, it is set in viewDidLoad and set to a Size just smaller than full screen.\r\n4) When running, rotate the device.  If not rotated to an orientation of the same size, VCB’s preferredContentSize will not be respected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen rotated, VCB’s view will be in the preferredContentSize.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen rotated, VCB’s size is the default formSheet view size.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways occurs in 8.1 on iPad, haven’t tested others.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo rotation events are delivered to VCB.\r\nWorkaround is something akin to :\r\nself.view.superview.frame = CGRectMake(…);\r\nin viewWillLayoutSubviews"
