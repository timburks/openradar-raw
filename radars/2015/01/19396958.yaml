    description: "Iâ€™m trying to write the equivalent of the following AppleScript in ObjC using the Scripting bridge (to control OmniFocus):\n\n\t\tset myTask to task id (taskID as string) of default document\n\t\tset myProj to project id (projectID as string) of default document\n\t\tmove myTask to end of tasks of myProj\n\nHowever, it is not possible in Scripting Bridge to specify a location in the collection. \n\nThere is a private API that does what I require:\n\n\t\t[myTask moveTo:myProject.rootTask.tasks.lastObject.positionAfter]\n\nPlease consider making this API public and documenting it."
