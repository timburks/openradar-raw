    description: "Currently to place an image on a NSUserNotification we are required to use the contentImage property. This places the image on the right and the app's icon on the left taking up the majority of the space on the notification. iTunes does not suffer from this limitation, the album artwork shows up large on the left while the iTunes icon is smaller on the right hand side. To do this you can use a private API along with `setValue:forKey` where the key is `_identityImage`. This API should be opened up to third party developers.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. Make a NSUserNotification\r\n2. Set an image as the key for `_identityImage`\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\nThe image shows up on the left side of the notification, like iTunes notifications, and your app is accepted into the Mac App Store \U0001F389\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\r\nGet rejected from the Mac App Store \U0001F626"
