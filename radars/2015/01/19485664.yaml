    description: "When an alarm set using the Clocks app comes due, the iOS device screen shows the words \"Tap to snooze\" in the system default color and font. When a timer set using the same Clocks app expires, the iOS device screen shows the words \"Tap to stop\" in the same color and font. The use of the same stylized text for two different functions within the same app is confusing. Users who make frequent use of both alarms and timers cannot develop muscle memory with regards to dismissing the alarms/timers. As a result, users who are not wearing their glasses in bed (eg. me) will tap the alarm, expecting it to \"stop\" but it will instead \"snooze\" and ring again while they are (I am) in the shower. When this occurs, other nearby people (eg. my wife) will be woken up by the alarm. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Set a timer using the Clock app (or Siri). When the timer expires, tap the screen to dismiss it. \r\n2. Repeat until you are used to this gesture.\r\n3. Set an alarm using the Clock app (or Siri). When the alarm comes due, tap the screen to dismiss it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alarm will stop, like the timer did.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alarm will be snoozed and ring again soon."
