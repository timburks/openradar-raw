        It seems that the controller has to be active in order to update the menu items. Clearing and reloading the menu in a paged based application on a specifically loaded page while that page is not active, i.e. while another page is selected and visible, will result in the menu not being updated properly.

        The workaround is to update the menu when the controller becomes active again, but reloading the menu seems to be relatively expensive, and so it would be nice to not have that action necessarily always tied with transitioning to the screen.
