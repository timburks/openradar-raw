    description: "Summary:\r\nI can make a generic protocol in Swift that has an associated type (see section on Generics in Swift book). I can then make my own types that conform to that protocol:\r\n\r\nFor example, here's the protocol:\r\n\r\n\tprotocol PointType {\r\n\t\ttypealias ScalarType\r\n\t\r\n\t\tvar x:ScalarType { get }\r\n\t\tvar y:ScalarType { get }\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nHere's a struct:\r\n \r\n\tstruct IntPoint {\r\n\t\tvar x:Int\r\n\t\tvar y:Int\r\n\t}\r\n \r\nAnd here's where I make the struct conform to the protocol:\r\n \r\n\textension IntPoint : PointType {\r\n\t\ttypealias ScalarType = Int\r\n\t}\r\n \r\nGroovy! Unfortunately when I try to make CGPoint conform to the protocol swiftc crashes:\r\n \r\n\textension CGPoint : PointType {\r\n\t\ttypealias ScalarType = CGFloat\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThis _should_ work. As far as I should care - CGPoint is just a swift struct (obviously under the hood it is more complex than this)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee description.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwiftc should not crash and I should be able to make CGPoint confirm to a protocol w/associated types\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C107a)\r\n\r\nOccurs in 6.1.1 too\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PointType.swift' was successfully uploaded."
