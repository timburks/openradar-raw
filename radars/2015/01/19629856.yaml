    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen interactively dismissing keyboard on UIScrollView with UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissModeInteractive on, the content jump before smoothly bouncing back to it's place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached iOS demo project\r\n2. Create a new item\r\n3. Tap the item to show the detail view\r\n4. Click on the textview\r\n5. Drag the keyboard down and let it go to dismiss it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe content of the scroll view should smoothly bounce back to it’s original position, like in Messages and Mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe content quickly jumps (to the top it seems) before it bounces back to it’s original position.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI added a link[4] to a demo project based on the master-detail iOS template that reproduces the bug in DetailViewController.swift in about 25 lines. The method used to adjust the scrollview to the shown/hidden keyboard is what is shown in the IOS Developer Libraries “Managing the Keyboard”[1] in listing 5-1, so it should be sound enough.\r\n\r\nI have also linked[2] to a video where you can see the bug in action, and the DetailViewController.swift[3] itself for your viewing pleasure.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html\r\n[2]: http://cl.ly/3g3h2i2c0b3w\r\n[3]: http://cl.ly/1E3N2a340z0J\r\n[4]: http://cl.ly/06001T3B2X2b"
