    description: "The Apple iOS Podcast app allows users to share links to podcasts. Those links use old-style Web Objects links. For example: https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=937578527#episodeGuid=http%3A%2F%2Frelay.fm%2Fbonanza%2F4. iTunes on Mac uses a link format that is similar to other media in the iTunes stores on both iOS and Mac OS X. For example, https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bonanza!-1-arkansas-chuggabug/id937578527?i=322565012&mt=2. The difference makes it difficult to provide a consistent user experience across platforms.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose a podcast in Apple's iOS Podcast app.\r\n2. Tap the share button.\r\n3. Copy the link generated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the Podcast app to return a link similar to what is returned by the iTunes Mac app and returned by the iOS App Store and iTunes Store apps. Something like the following: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bonanza!-1-arkansas-chuggabug/id937578527?i=322565012&mt=2\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the iOS Podcast app returns a WebObjects link like this: https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=937578527#episodeGuid=http%3A%2F%2Frelay.fm%2Fbonanza%2F4. This seems to be the last remaining place in any of Apple's iOS apps where a WebObjects link is returned."
