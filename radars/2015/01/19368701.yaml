    description: "Image URLs returned by the iTunes Search API return media artwork images at 60x60 (too small) and 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels (too big). There used to be a hack to get alternate size images (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13382208/getting-bigger-artwork-images-from-itunes-web-search/14417222#14417222), but that no longer works. Offering multiple size files as part of the iTunes Search API would allow third party developers to minimize data usage and enhance user experience under poor network conditions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search for content using iTunes Search API. For example, https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=yelp&country=us&entity=software\r\n2. Returns two sizes of images. 1024x1024 (http://a1262.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/04/24/6d/04246da1-0536-0545-467e-53974d9fa1c4/mzl.nevrdwno.png) and 60x60 (http://a1568.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/df/03/41/df03410b-a6c2-ba1c-8438-3c8de9e3834a/AppIcon60x60_U00402x.png)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI use iTunes media artwork in an affiliate linking app under development. I expected to be able to get artwork close to the size I display in my app (100x100px).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, I have to scale down 512x512 or 1024x1024 images, which take longer to download and scale them down, which pixelates the images."
