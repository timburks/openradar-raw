    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode provides the “Launch due to a background event” scheme option for debugging background fetch. I am able to test background fetch manually in Xcode by selecting “Debug→Simulate Background Fetch,” but the scheme option seems to have no effect on anything.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project in Xcode.\r\n2. Verify that the “Launch due to a background event” setting is enabled for the active scheme.\r\n3. Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app will launch in the background and perform a background fetch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app launches in the foreground. No background fetch is performed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\nOS X Version 10.10.1 (14B25)"
