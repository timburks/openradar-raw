    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMy app's App Icon is missing on the Mac App Store and on the downloaded app. Icon is visible in Xcode and app passes Validation.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a caching issue. There has been no app icon for many days, and others have reported this to me. It's not just my machine.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a new version of my app. After being reviewed and released, the app icon is missing *everywhere* in the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nICON MISSING:  \r\n - Mac App Store search results\r\n - App's page on the Mac App Store\r\n - Once downloaded, App has no icon.\r\n - Notification Center messages have no App Icon.\r\n - Anywhere that touched the Mac App Store.\r\n - The \"build\" section of iTunes Connect. Small \"build\" app icon is missing after you upload a build, where it should show the icon.\r\n \r\nICON VISIBLE:  \r\n - The app `product` as built via Xcode, viewed in the Finder.\r\n - Images.xcassets file in Xcode.\r\n - iTunes Connect shows correct icon.\r\n - Essentially anywhere *other* than the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Upload a build with an images.xcassets file with  256@2x and 512@2x files (only). See picture.\r\n- I have since tried this with a *full* images.xcassets file. Same issue. So the missing resolutions don't cause the issue.\r\n- Validate using the Organizer. Validates fine.\r\n- Upload to Mac App Store. Note that \"build\" thumbnail is missing on iTunes Connect for the build you just uploaded.\r\n- Go through review. Pass review with no issues. Not rejected due to missing icon.\r\n- Everywhere in review and iTunes Connect, it looks fine.\r\n- Once released, look for your app on the Mac App Store. The icon is not visible. See pics.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy app has an icon! Customers buy an app that has an icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo app icon! Huge headache.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI recently switch the NAME of my app.\r\nI recently switched to using Asset Catalog for my app icon images in Xcode."
