        Summary:
        Making a new target will silently overwrite any existing files. The old contents aren’t moved to the trash, either, they’re just gone. This is unrecoverable if you haven’t committed/backed up yet.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make a new app.
        2. Edit some of the sources, e.g. AppDelegate.swift
        3. Delete the app target. Note that AppDelegate.swift’s contents are preserved at this point.
        4. Make a new target; make it an app target and give it the same name as the previous one had.


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to preserve my changes, possibly renaming the original file, or prompting me, or moving the original file to the trash.


        Actual Results:
        It silently overwrote them.


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        This just cost me a morning’s work.
