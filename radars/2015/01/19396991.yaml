        I would like to be able to send Apple Events directly to the target application. What that should entail is a way of easily building an Apple Event to send to the target process, and a way of sending it. I know I could build my own Apple Event then send it using AESendMessage, but that is not convenient to integrate with Scripting Bridge code. I suggest the following APIs on SBApplication:

        - (NSAppleEventDescriptor*)appleEventTargetDescriptor; // returns an NSAppleEventDescriptor that can be used as the target descriptor for another event

        - (BOOL)sendAppleEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor*)event sendMode:(AESendMode)sendMode timeout:(NSTimeInterval)timeout completion:(void (^)(NSAppleEventDescriptor* reply, NSError *error))completionBlock;
