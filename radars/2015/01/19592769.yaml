    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an UIVisualEffectView with UIBlurEffect that shows on top of a remote image. Iâ€™d like to be able to set the blur style dynamically, according to the contents of the image (so the content on UIVisualEffectView is legible).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to set effect on UIVisualEffectView or look for a style property on UIBlurEffect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\neffect would be a read-write property or UIBlurEffect would have a read-write style property.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\neffect is read-only and UIBlurEffect has no style property.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUIVisualEffectView was introduced on iOS 8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
