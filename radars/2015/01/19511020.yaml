    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to share a home with another user using `HMHome.addUserWithCompletionHandler()`, I get a successful response. But the home never appears on the other user's device when shared from the iCloud account \"***\".\r\n\r\nSharing does work from other iCloud accounts though - so it seems to be an iCloud issue with the above mentioned account.\r\n\r\nI see the following error logs on the device which tries to share the home.\r\n\r\nhomed[96] <Warning>: Failed to send message with identifier 52727205-CBFB-4A6C-9573-C833CC28E4FF from account: IDSAccount: 0x14e24050 [Service: com.apple.private.alloy.willow  User: ***  ID: EE58EE47-57DC-48F7-8DD5-BE55505420E5  Type: Apple ID  Active: YES  Registration Status: Registered] with error: Error Domain=com.apple.identityservices.error Code=15 \"Encryption failed\" UserInfo=0x14e1e7a0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.
