    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is applicable for the iOS Podcasts app, Version 2.2 (740)\r\n\r\nUsers can have multiple podcasts in the My Podcasts view, however, users are not always subscribed to all of the podcasts in the view. Some are just 1 or 2 downloaded episodes of the feed, some are subscriptions that have been halted by the user, etc.\r\n\r\nThis new version introduces a warning message for Podcasts that haven't been played recently. It is a yellow-ish banner at the top of the episode list (attached):\r\n\"This podcast has stopped automatically downloading because you haven't viewed or played it recently. Tap to resume.\"\r\n\r\nThis message appears when a feed hasn't been opened in a while, my guess would be a few weeks. The problem is that it appears for every podcast that has the \"Download Episodes\" setting set to anything other than \"Off\", even is the Subscribed toggle is disabled. Since the disabled subscribe toggle prevents podcasts from automatically downloading new episodes, the warning is not applicable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iOS Podcasts app\r\n2. Go to the Featured tab\r\n3. Open a random podcast page (e.g. NPR: Planet Money Podcast)\r\n4. In the Details tab, download a random episode from the feed.\r\n5. Wait for the required amount of time (few weeks?). Given the default setting \"Download Episodes\" -> \"Only New\", the banner will appear even though the podcast is not subscribed to. It will be indicated by an orange exclamation mark badge on the podcast image, in the My Podcasts tab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe banner should only appear if a podcast is both downloaded automatically AND subscribed to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe banner appears for podcasts that aren't subscribed to.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4s 16GB, Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0191.PNG', 'IMG_0192.PNG' and 'IMG_0193.PNG' were successfully uploaded."
