    description: "Summary:\r\nThe use of optional enums as parameters to closures in Swift code (such as for completion handlers) crashes the Swift compiler with a segmentation fault\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild the attached CompilerCrasherExperiment with Xcode 6.1.1. It's an iOS project with an EnumThing.swift file:\r\nenum EnumThing {\r\n    case Foo,\r\n    Bar\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc doSomething (completion: (thing: EnumThing?) -> Void) {\r\n    completion (thing: .Foo)\r\n}\r\n\r\nwhich is then called from ViewController.viewDidLoad() as follows:\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.\r\n        doSomething { (thing: EnumThing?) -> Void in\r\n            let msg = thing == .Foo ? \"Foo\" : \"Bar\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen run, this should do nothing (although a breakpoint would allow you to see that the msg variable is being set in doSomething()).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashes the Xcode build. Swift Compiler Error: Command failed due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11\r\n\r\n(too much text to paste - will attach as CompileSwift-crash-log.txt)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.10.1 (14B25), Xcode Version 6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have found that using non-optional enums as parameters eliminates crashes like this.\r\n\r\nI've had similar swiftc crashes passing structs as optionals, but don't have a buglet put together for that.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CompilerCrasherExperiment.zip' and 'CompileSwift-crash-log.txt' were successfully uploaded."
