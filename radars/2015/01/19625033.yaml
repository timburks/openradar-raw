    description: "Summary:\nPer Winnie Technmannâ€™s notes: \nhttps://twitter.com/thatswinnie/status/560259247498600448\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nAsk Siri who owns this phone.\n\n\nExpected Results:\nI expected some minimal information, and perhaps the emergency info HealthKit can share.\n\n\nActual Results:\nThe whole contact card. This means that someone asking that of my otherwise unlockable phone now knows way too much about not only me but my family as well. \n\n\nRegression:\nWinnie also notes the workaround: https://twitter.com/thatswinnie/status/560262843397070849\n\nNotes:\nN/A"
