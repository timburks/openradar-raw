    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen printing a webpage that uses a fixed-width container in Safari, the apparent font size in the output is significantly smaller when compared to printed versions of the same webpage from other browsers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsbin.com/tuxos/2 in Safari 8.0 (10600.1.25) on OS X Yosemite\r\n2. File->Print\r\n3. Set \"Paper Size\" to \"US Letter\"\r\n4. Ensure that \"Scale\" is set to \"100%\"\r\n5. PDF->Open PDF in Preview\r\n6. Compare the resulting PDF to those produced by Chrome's or Firefox's print features.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisregarding margins and margin-related scaling, Safari's PDF should look nearly the same as the other browsers' PDFs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDue to page scaling (or font size adjustment?), the apparent font size in Safari's PDF is significantly smaller compared to the other browsers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0 (10600.1.25)\r\nOS X Yosemite\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding\r\n  .container {\r\n    width: auto !important;\r\n  }\r\nseems to make Safari scale the page closer to how the other browsers scale it.\r\n\r\nWebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138192\r\nOriginal Bootstrap issue: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/14868\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'printouts.png' was successfully uploaded."
