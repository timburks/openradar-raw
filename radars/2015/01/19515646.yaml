    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using cmd-tab to jump to an application it is not guaranteed that the focus will end up on the last focused window of that application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have two monitors (external to laptop for example).\r\n2. On your main monitor have an app in fullscreen, on the second monitor have a window from the same app (not necessarily in fullscreen).\r\n3. Make sure focus is on the fullscreen window.\r\n4. Use cmd-tab to jump to another application with a window on your main monitor.\r\n5. The fullscreen space is swept away.\r\n6. Main monitor now have the window of the newly selected app active, the second monitor still shows the window of the first app.\r\n7. Use cmd-tab to switch back to the first app.\r\n8. The focus is set on the window on the secondary monitor. Fullscreen window is not shown.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would like the _last focused_ window of the target application to get focus. I usually have a fullscreen terminal on both monitors. On my secondary monitor I have logs open. On the main monitor I have Vim. If I cmd-tab to Safari and then back the log window gets focus. When the Vim window was the one I wanted to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFocus is set on the wrong window."
