        Summary:
        In the “Activity” section of the iCloud Photo Sharing tab in the Photos app, sometimes, the preview of a video or photo does not match the photo or video that is referenced, and that appears when tapped.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Tap on a photo referenced in the Activity section

        Expected Results:
        Photo or video preview matches the actual photo or video referenced

        Actual Results:
        Photo or video preview does not match the actual photo or video referenced

        Regression:


        Notes:
        It seems that the issue is persistent to individual photos or videos, i.e., if I leave the Activity screen or force quit the app and relaunch, the same mismatched photo pair exists (same incorrect photo paired with same correct photo). As can be seen in the video capture, the preview changes to the actual asset at the very end of the transition.
