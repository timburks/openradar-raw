    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I get to the office, I plug my rMBP into a thunderbolt display and leave it in clamshell mode.  I then try and play music in Spotify with AirPlay as an output device.  However, AirPlay works, at most, once and many times never.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetup:  rMBP running 10.10.1 running in clamshell mode attached to an Apple Thunderbolt display.  Spotify playing music (haven't tested with iTunes).  There are two people in my office.  There is one AirPort Extreme providing WiFi and internet access.  An Airport Express is extending the wireless network and has speakers attached to it.  This is the output device I'm trying to play music with.  Both airports have the latest firmware updates.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1.  Leave home network, travel to office and office network.\r\n2.  Put rMBP in clamshell mode, log in.\r\n3.  Open Spotify, play music\r\n4.  Option-click on volume and select AirPlay for device output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAirPlay should connect quickly and start playing music soon after.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo possible scenarios happen:\r\n\r\n1.  Sounds starts playing.  If the Spotify track is the last track and music stops, AirPlay disconnects and is never able to reconnect.\r\n\r\n2.  Sound doesn't start playing. AirPlay is never able to connect.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, logging out does not fix the situation.  A full reboot is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)"
