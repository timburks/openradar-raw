    description: "Summary:\r\nThis bug occurs only on iPhone 6 plus. The Keyboard doesn't hide on a modal pushed ViewController after an orientation change. Both ways (resignFirstResponder and endEditing) was tested, both function calls returns with a \"true\" value, but the keyboard is still visible on the screen. If I start the app in landscape modus, the methods works like expected.\r\n\r\nI tested the same code on a iPhone 6 and the methods works like expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open example app in portrait modus\r\n2. Tap on the open button (to push a modal ViewController)\r\n3. Tap on the TextField to open the Keyboard (becomeFirstResponder)\r\n4. Tap on the Done Button within the accessoryView -> Everything works fine\r\n5. Rotate Device to Landscape modus and tap again on the TextField\r\n6. Tap on the Done Button again -> Keyboard is still visible\r\n7. Tap on the keyboard button to hide the keyboard is working correctly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I call resignFirstResponder or endEditing(true) then the Keyboard should disappear on every device in every orientation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Keyboard is still visible even though I called the resignFirstResponder or endEditing method. This occurs only on iPhone 6 plus."
