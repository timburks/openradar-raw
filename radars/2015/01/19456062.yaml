    description: "Summary:\r\nI imported all of my photos taken with iPhones from 2010-2014 to iCloud Photos using AirDrop from my Mac, some of them had wrong EXIF data - maybe because they were saved from other apps to the camera roll.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Some photos had GPS date but were placed on the wrong date.\r\n2. Some photos had no date and were placed on the same date that I saved them to the Mac.\r\n3. Some photos had no location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOrganized Photos Library like in the keynote.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI asked some friends and found out that its a common problem, because there is no other way I built a small app to help advanced users to organize their photo library.\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/from-an-idea-to-the-app-store-in-16-days-f5b2d0b1ceff\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-organizer-view-edit/id954717485?ls=1&mt=8\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
