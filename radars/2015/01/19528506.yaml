    description: We’d like to request the ability to customize the press states for buttons in WatchKit. Currently the only press states available to 3rd party developers are the darkened icon effects built into WatchKit. While we realize that table-view style press states that involve executing code likely aren’t possible, we’d love at least pre-defined press state icons that could be added to the storyboard and rendered on the watch while a button is tapped.
