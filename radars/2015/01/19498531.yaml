        Summary:
        Xcode reports that a device is locked, even when it isn’t.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode with an iOS project.
        2. Attach iPhone 6 with a passcode and Touch ID enabled.
        3. Try to build and run the iOS project on the iPhone 6.
        4. Note that Xcode (correctly) warns that the device is locked.
        5. Unlock the device with Touch ID.
        6. Build and run the project again. Xcode sometimes complains that the device is still locked, even when it isn’t.

        Expected Results:
        Xcode runs the App on the device when it is unlocked.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode does not run the App on device and instead complains that the device is locked.

        Regression:
        None observed.
