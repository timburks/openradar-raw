        Since the Scripting Bridge can never be perfect (purely by view of it being an abstraction on top of a poorly specified language that every target app implements differently), we need a way to drop down to AppleScript itself. Can I suggest something like the following:

        - [SBObject executeAppleScriptWithFormat:(NSString*)appleScript, …]

        What this would do is execute the piece of AppleScript as if it were inside a “tell ___” block, with ___ being the SBObject that it was sent to. (You’d need to be able to send it to an SBElementArray as well.)

        The format would be a string of AppleScript, with substitution variables which allow you to plug other SBObjects into there, and the Scripting Bridge figures out how to get the right AppleScript reference to the object and pass that in. So I’d be able to do something like this:

        		OmniFocusContext *context = …
        		OmniFocusTask *task = …
        		[task executeAppleScriptWithFormat:@“set context to %@“, context];

        Obviously the above is just an example, since that is something that could be done with the Scripting Bridge directly, but there will always be things that cannot be done, so we NEED a way to drop down to AppleScript itself.
