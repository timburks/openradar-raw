    description: "Summary:\r\nA partition of the HDD inside should be able to be specified to work with iTunes Home Sharing. This would allow media files stored on the HDD to be accessed by Macs and PCs running iTunes, and Apple TVs.\r\n\r\nIt would mean that content on Apple TV could be played without having a Mac or PC on and running iTunes, or without streaming over the internet — something that can pose a problem to those with limited data-allowance, or slow connections.\r\n\r\nThe Time Capsule system could potentially be smart enough to detect iTunes libraries backed up with Time Machine, and automatically share that media.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Store (or back up) media on an HDD partition in a Time Capsule.\r\n2. Try to watch that media using iTunes on a PC or Mac, or Apple TV.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Time Capsule presents it’s self as a HomeShare, allowing media to be viewed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Time Capsule stores the media. On PC and Mac, the Time Capsule can be mounted as a network drive, and media can be played that way."
