        Summary:
        Developers are making less money from apps, meaning we have to work more efficiently and do more with less and react faster to the market. The tools and APIs are brilliant and let us get so much done in very little time, yet the submit & approval process adds a week or so of delay.

        And now on top of that, we also have to factor in additional time for TestFlight beta approvals if we want to draw on our audience of users and get their feedback.

        Since the app will be reviewed anyway, I strongly feel that any benefit or added sense of security is greatly outweighed by the additional burden on developers.

        I'd suggest that existing apps in good standing should be allowed to bypass Beta review and that only brand new apps should have to be approved.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Try to provide a new version of your app to external testers

        Expected Results:
        - You can immediately invite them and ask them to provide feedback before your real submit

        Actual Results:
        - You have to wait several days, by which time your pre-holiday submit window will have closed, leaving you with option a) submit without external tester's feedback or b) don't ship a cool new feature for the holidays
