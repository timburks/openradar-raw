    description: "Summary:\r\nOften, such as in the morning when the “I’m working from home” or “I’m out sick today” e-mails start rolling in, I have a half-dozen or so e-mails in my inbox that I want to perform two actions on: marking as read and moving into a folder. In iOS Mail, once you select multiple messages and mark as read, they become unselected, forcing you to re-select them to move them to a folder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select multiple unread messages in your inbox.\r\n2. Select Mark→Mark as Read.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe e-mail messages you selected are marked as read and are still selected, allowing you to perform another option.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe e-mail messages are marked as read, and your selection disappears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2 [12B440]"
