    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Disk Utility app cannot restore a valid backup in a disk image because it encounters a \"resource busy\" error when scanning the image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFor this test, you need some media that you can backup, erase and restore. I have used both a 1 TB disk drive and a 1 GB thumb drive.\r\n\r\n1. Mount the disk\r\n\r\n2. Create a new disk image by selecting the volume on your test drive and clicking \"New Image\". Set the image format to \"read-only\" and the encryption to \"none\".\r\n\r\n3. Enter your password so Disk Utility can make changes\r\n\r\n4. Verify the disk image was created.\r\n\r\n5. Select the test drive and click the \"Partition\" tab. Select a single partition. Set the format to \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\". Click \"Apply\" then \"Partition\" to partition the drive with an empty \"Untitled 1\" volume.\r\n\r\n6. Click on the \"Restore\" tab\r\n\r\n7. Drag the disk image file you created in steps 2-4 into the Source field\r\n\r\n8. Drag the \"Untitled 1\" volume you just created to the Destination field\r\n\r\n9. Click \"Restore\" then \"Erase\" in the confirmation dialog\r\n\r\n10. Enter your password so Disk Utility can make changes\r\n\r\n11. Click \"Scan Disk Image\" when prompted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe disk image source would be scanned and the blocks would be copied to the destination.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou will see a message saying \"Unable to scan \"Untitled 1.\" (Resource busy)\". You freak the fuck out because YOU CANNOT RESTORE A BACKUP.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nClicking on the \"Image...\" button causes the same behavior as drag & drop.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is to select the disk image in the lefthand sidebar instead of selecting a Source image. After the scan is complete, you have to re-initiate the restore and blocks will start copying."
