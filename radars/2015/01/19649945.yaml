    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile animating in, the split keyboardâ€™s background on iPad spans the full width of the device. When the animation is complete, the background changes to only be behind the two separate parts of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure that split keyboard is enabled\r\n2. Bring up the keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard animates in with no visual bugs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe background of the keyboard spans the full width of the device until animation is complete.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue is not present in Messages, as it seems to maintain the background due to the fact that the input field is connected to the top of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini with Retina Display (32GB)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nVideo of issue: http://cl.ly/2z013Y1o1B18"
