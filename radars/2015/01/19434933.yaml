    description: "Summary:\r\nOn non-retina screens, at certain viewport widths, an alpha-channel linear background gradient has a dark vertical line at its edge in Safari on OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Go to a Mac with a non-retina screen.\r\n1. In Safari 8, open http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel\r\n       or http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.2.0/docs/javascript/#carousel\r\n2. Resize the window horizontally while observing the right side of the carousel.\r\n3. As you resize, you'll observe a dark vertical line flicker in and out of view (see screenshot).\r\n4. While the line is visible, stop resizing. The line will remain visible.\r\nYou can refresh the page or open the same page in a new tab (while keeping the window the same size)\r\nto confirm that the bug is not related to resizing. (It's just necessary to discover what are the\r\nright \"magic\" window widths where the bug is visible.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no dark vertical line at the edge of the alpha-channel gradient.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt certain sizes, there is a dark vertical line at the edge of the alpha-channel gradient.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0.2 (10600.2.5)\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you inspect the\r\n    <a class=\"right carousel-control\" href=\"#carousel-example-generic\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"next\">\r\nin the carousel (i.e. the carousel's right arrow)\r\nand disable its \"background-image: linear-gradient\" CSS styles,\r\nyou'll observe that the line disappears, which indicates that the line is due to the gradient.\r\n\r\nOriginal Bootstrap issue: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/15205\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'carousel.png' was successfully uploaded."
