    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you right-click on a message in Mail, then select “Move To” and a folder, the message will appear to have moved to the folder. If you have a Smart Mailbox for all unread mail, and you do this on a message in your Inbox, the message will still be in the Inbox when the move operation is done. This is a Gmail account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Smart Mailbox (screenshot attached) for all unread mail.\r\n2. Receive new unread mail in your Inbox.\r\n3. In the Smart Mailbox, read the message, right-click it in the message list, select “Move To,” and move it to a folder.\r\n4. Navigate to the Inbox.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe message, having been moved to a folder, will not be in the Inbox.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message is in the Inbox.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 8.1 (1993) on OS X Version 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe account in question is a Gmail account. This may be due to Gmail’s labels-vs.-folders distinction compared to most IMAP providers."
