    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen removing a city/location from the Today View weather widget, after short time, they come back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Remove a city from the Today View weather widget.\r\n2. Wait.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe removed city/cities are still gone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe removed cities reappear\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis may be an iCloud sync issue — syncing the cities, but not the deletion of cities from the widget. But I’ve not tested this."
