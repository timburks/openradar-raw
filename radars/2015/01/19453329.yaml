    description: "Summary:\r\nOne of the coolest things that GitHub does is automatically mark notifications as read when you open the e-mail associated with the notification (using, I presume, specially-crafted embedded images). It would be neat if subscribing to e-mail updates to a forum on the Apple Developer Forums could accomplish the same thing, marking threads as read as the e-mails are opened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subscribe to e-mail updates to a forum on Apple Developer Forums.\r\n2. Open an e-mail notification.\r\n3. Head to the forum in Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe thread for which you opened the e-mail notification is marked as read.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe thread is marked as unread."
