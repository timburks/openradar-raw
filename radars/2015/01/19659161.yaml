    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter entering Full Screen mode to read a book, I am unable to exit Full Screen mode.  When I initiate the command to exit Full Screen mode iBooks hangs and becomes unresponsive.  I've reproduced this with multiple different books from my iBooks library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a book in iBooks.\r\n2. Enter Full Screen mode.  Using either the keyboard shortcut or the green \"maximize\" widget on the window.\r\n3. Try to exit Full Screen mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe book exits full screen mode and remembers it's previous window position.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe book stays in full screen mode.  The application hangs and is unresponsive.  iBooks must be killed using either Activity Monitor or Force Quit.  The application is able to be killed with a regular Quit, it doesn't have to be a Force Quit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Version: 10.10.2\r\niBooks version: 1.1.1 (600)"
