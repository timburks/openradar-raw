    description: "Summary:\r\nTyping or pasting a Google Image Search URL into the Safari navigation bar results in Safari loading a web search results page. \r\n\r\n(Clicking a link to an Image Search URL, however, loads the image search results as expected.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Paste the following URL into Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/search?q=Wade+Guyton&tbm=isch\r\n2. Observe that it loads the search results page with the \"Images\" tab selected and displays image results.\r\n3. Paste the same URL into Safari and observe that the \"Web\" tab is selected and web results are displayed.\r\n4. Note that if Safari is the default browser and the link is clicked, the expected image search results will be displayed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect image search results to be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWeb search results are displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\nSafari Version 8.0 (10600.1.25.1)"
