    description: We use glBlitFramebuffer to save and restore depth-stencil renderbuffers. When both the source and destination buffers are multisampled however the blit operation no longer seems to work properly (the blit destination does not appear to contain the correct depth image). When msaa is not used then everything works as expected. There is no error generated in the msaa version of the test and CheckFramebufferStatus never reports any problem so I assume the test code is correct.
