    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a button constrained to a certain width, with word wrap on, and you give it a title which causes the button to wrap, then the button's UIButtonLabel will wrap correctly and grow in height, but the button itself will not change size. This causes misleading click targets, and possible overflows if you are spacing your button with other content via autolayout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Make a UIButton in interface builder. \r\n2.) Constrain it's left and right edges to some other interface element.\r\n3.) Set UIButton to word wrap.\r\n4.) Set title of button to more than 1 line's worth of text.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to see button label wrap (in this case growing in height) and the button increases in size to encompass it's label.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button label wraps and grows in height, but the button itself remains the same height. Capturing view hierarchy confirms that the button is smaller than it's corresponding label.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2 (12B440)"
