    description: "Summary:\r\nIn OS X Mavericks (10.9), after deleting an app's sandbox container, on next run, the sandbox container is recreated, with the exception of the app's Preferences plist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n 1. Run either of the included apps in Xcode 4.6.3 or Xcode 5 Developer Preview. It has a single checkbox that is persisted to the sandbox's Preferences plist.\r\n 2. Click the checkbox and quit the app.\r\n 3. Re-run the app to verify the checkbox is checked on subsequent launch, and quit the app.\r\n 4. Delete the app's Sandbox: rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.orangutango.SandboxDefaults (or com.orangutango.SandboxDefaultsXcode4)\r\n 5. Re-run the app from Xcode, click the checkbox, and quit.\r\n 6. Re-run the app from Xcode, verify the checkbox is *not* checked.\r\n 7. Verify that ~/Library/Containers/com.orangutango.SandboxDefaults{Xcode4}/Data/Library/Preferences/com.orangutango.SandboxDefaults{Xcode4}.plist does not exist.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n When the Sandbox is recreated, it's expected that the plist for the app's defaults is recreated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhile the rest of the Sandbox is recreated, the app's defaults plist is not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a sample project you can use to verify the bug (just supplying the Xcode 5 version)\r\n\r\nCreating the defaults plist manually in the recreated containers folder makes it so values will start saving again.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of <rdar://problem/14187964>\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is a regression from 10.8, where the same code works as expected.  \r\nMac Pro.spx - configuration file has been successfully uploaded\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SandboxDefaults.zip' and 'Mac Pro.spx' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations13-Sep-2013 04:40 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. \r\n\r\nThe open or closed status of the original bug report your issue was duplicated to appears in the yellow \"Duplicate of XXXXXXXX\" section of the bug reporter user interface.
