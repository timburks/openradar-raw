        Summary:
        There used to be a menu that let you show alternative views of a mail message.  This was very handy when viewing a message where the html formatting was badly done or hard to read.  That menu seems to have been removed despite it’s significant contribution to Mail.app’s usefulness.  Please consider adding it back.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. in Mail.app view a message with HTML formatting.  Preferably with gaudy colours or bad layout code that squishes paragraphs to about 15 points wide.
        2. Look for the “Show plain text alternative” menu. It’s not there.

        Expected Results:
        1. View terribly formatted message
        2. Select the “Show plain text alternative” menu and find peace

        Actual Results:
        1. View terribly formatted message
        2. Look for the “Show plain text alternative” menu. It’s not there.  Delete the message without reading it.


        Regression:
        This was in a previous version of Mail.app.  I’m sorry that I don’t know from which version it was removed.

        Notes:
        Please re-add this.  It was so useful!  While you’re in that part of the code maybe you could make a checkbox that enables the “com.apple.mail.PreferPlainText” defaults setting?  I will love you forever.
