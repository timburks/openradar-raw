    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you're running your WatchKit extension, you can see the console output from it, but not from the parent iPhone app. When you run the parent app, you can't interact with the watch simulator. It would be nice to be able to see both the console output of the WatchKit extension and the parent iPhone app simultaneously.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iPhone app with a WatchKit extension.\r\n2. Run the watch app target in Xcode.\r\n3. Press ⌘⇧Y to reveal the console in Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone app’s console output will be displayed alongside the WatchKit app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the WatchKit extension’s output appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C101), OS X 10.10.1 (14B25)"
