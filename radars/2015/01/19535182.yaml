    description: "Summary:\r\nIf iOS Simulator.app is not open and then: I wipe a simulator, install an app and then try launching it from simctl, it does not start ever.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nissue the following commands in your Terminal:\r\n\r\nkillall \"iOS Simulator\"\r\nDEVICE_UUID=\"B6EF565C-C3B1-4449-8EC6-C9FECD10D90A\"\r\nAPP=<Path to some .app>\r\nAPP_ID=<app identifier>\r\nxcrun simctl shutdown $DEVICE_UUID\r\nxcrun simctl erase $DEVICE_UUID\r\nxcrun simctl boot $DEVICE_UUID\r\nxcrun simctl install $DEVICE_UUID $APP\r\nxcrun simctl launch $DEVICE_UUID $APP_ID\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsimctl should return with the process id of the app being run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsimctl hangs and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems the only way to get this to work is the have the Simulator app open, though the api should tell you this."
