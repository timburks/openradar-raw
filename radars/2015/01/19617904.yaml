    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen releasing an app for a beta, there can be issues, data loss, crashing, etc.  This is why the app is in beta.\r\n\r\nWhen a user participates in a TestFlight beta, the installed shipping version of the app is overwritten.  There is no way to have a beta version running for testing, and a stable version installed for the use by the user.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to specify that a TestFlight beta should be installed alongside the shipping app.\r\n\r\nIt could potentially happen automatically for the user with the bundle ID automatically having '.beta’ appended, giving each app a unique beta bundle ID.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the icon could automatically be given a ‘Beta’ banner.\r\n\r\nOr, instead of an automatic process, the developer could provide a bundle ID and icons for the beta versions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTestFlight in iOS 8."
