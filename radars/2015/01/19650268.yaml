    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the split keyboard on iPad, the Find in Page UI in Safari seems to be cropped to fit the area above the split keyboard. This presents it’s self both when the keyboard is visible, and when it is hidden.\r\n\r\nIt’s especially visible when entering a new search term in the Find in Page UI, as a “done” button appears, pushing the left of the input box off the cropped area.\r\n\r\nIn both instances, the top border of the UI is still visible, spanning the full width of the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, with a web page open, type a search query into the address bar.\r\n2. Under on “On This Page” tap “Find…”\r\n3. Bring up they keyboard tapping the search field in the Find on Page UI.\r\n4. Split the keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Find on Page UI would span the full width of the page, displaying the background correctly. When they keyboard is visible, the UI would not be cropped to fit the area above the split keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Find on Page UI — with the exception of it’s top border — seems to be cropped to fit the area above the split keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Messages app has a similar UI, with the text input being fixed to the top of the keyboard. It does not have the same issue, though, as the keyboard — even in split mode, extends the full width off the screen.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini with Retina Display\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot 1: http://cl.ly/image/2d0i25222p3p\r\nScreenshot 2: http://cl.ly/image/1w01273p1p15"
