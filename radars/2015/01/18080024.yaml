    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8 UINavigationController gained some methods to manage it's navigation and tool bars. In addition, it should provide a method which includes toggling the status bar as well.\r\n\r\nThis is already used internally by Apple's Maps app (see attached video). We think this is very useful and should be included in UIKit as public API, as we have found no way to achieve the same animation with public API.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround we've implemented our own class which manages this, but due to the inability to customise the status bar animation, it looks not as good as the animation from Apple Maps. I've included an example project which demos our status bar manager.\r\n\r\nThis is especially useful for apps apps which want to utilise iOS's devices full screen, but provide the user with the ability to show all available controls including the status bar, which Apple Maps itself is actually a perfect example for.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'barhidemaps.mov' and 'HideBarsExample.zip' were successfully uploaded."
