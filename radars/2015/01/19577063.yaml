    description: "Summary:\r\nIn MobileSafari, there's an AutoFill button that allows you to fill a form with iCloud Keychain credentials. If user has more than one credential pair with a website, tapping AutoFill should ask user which one they mean to authenticate with.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open MobileSafari\r\n2. Go to website where you have multiple accounts saved in iCloud Keychain\r\n3. Go to login page\r\n4. Tap AutoFill\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari asks you which account you mean\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt fills credentials for only one of the accounts (it's unclear how it picks which one)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niCloud Keychain API available for 3rd party apps has this feature.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
