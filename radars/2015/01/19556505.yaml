    description: "Summary:\r\nPresenting a keyboard from within a popover can result in a state where the application is completely frozen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch example. Tap the “Okay, let’s freeze!” button and observe the process to make it freeze.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee a text field in the popover.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication completely freezes, UIKit loops within layoutSublayers endlessly. There’s no way to get the app into a working state again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks correctly under iOS 7.1 (uncomment the old popover logic to try it in the example)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHaven’t found a great workaround for this nasty bug yet. Any comments greatly appreciated."
