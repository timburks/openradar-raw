    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes I fire up iTunes, or just wake my Mac from sleep, and the images never show up for my iTunes Radio channels. Not sure if it's because it tries to load them before the Mac successfully connects to the WiFi network and never tries again or what. If I restart iTunes, some of the time, at least, the images show up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Connect to iTunes Radio, add some channels, make sure images display.\r\n* Quit iTunes\r\n* Turn off WiFi (or disable all network access)\r\n* Start iTunes Radio again\r\n* Images will be missing\r\n* Connect to WiFi (or other network)\r\n* Play iTunes Radio\r\n* Still no images\r\n* Restart iTunes\r\n* Images will appear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImages should appear. If iTunes can't connect to the network, it should used cached images from the last time it connected. Once it is able to connect, it should update the images.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImages do not appear when not connected to the network. If you then connect and play iTunes radio, images still do not appear.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 (14C94b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSeems like iTunes should use Reachability to determine changes in connectivity state and take action."
