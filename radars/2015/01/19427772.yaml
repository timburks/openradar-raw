        Summary:
        There is no way to visualize the storage available on the backup media / history of Time Machine backups or failures other than trolling system.log in server.app

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Install OS X 10.10.1 (Build 14B25) on a Mac Mini
        Install Server App 4.0.3 (Build 14S350)
        Configure the server to back up to a Time Capsule on the local network
        Click on Overview/Settings/Storage and there is no indication that backups are enabled
        There is no indication when the last backup completed successfully
        There is no indication if the last backup had an error or what that error might have been

        Expected Results:
        Better communication of the lack of backup at all (if Time Machine is never configured)
        Better communication on the status of the last backup
        Better communication of error status if a backup interval, device or drive fails.

        Actual Results:
        Only my looking in system.log can errors and last interval be obtained in this configuration

        Regression:
        unknown

        Notes:
        see attached screen shot with a potential place to list this information under the storage tab for server.app so it is easily communicated and recorded
