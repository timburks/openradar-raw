        The default Glance templates do not have a way to use the San Francisco font with the following characteristics:
        - Size larger than “Body”, ideally at least 20pt or higher
        - The ability to wrap to multiple lines

        We’d like the ability to use a glance template to create a label that will show in a large font size but still wrap to multiple lines. The use case for our glance is to show a currently selected section and track for an audio player. Wrapping the section title to one line at a medium size is fine, but the track title is the most important item on the screen, so we feel it should merit a larger font size, but doing so would lose us the ability to wrap it to multiple lines.
