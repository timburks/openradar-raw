        Summary:
        Online documentation for software updates not available

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Wait for an Update, like iOS 8.1.3 or OS X 10.10.2 to become available to the general public.
        Search for that Update on Apple's support pages/kBase, etc.


        Expected Results:
        Searching for “iOS 8.1.3” should lead to the release notes kBase article of said update.

        Actual Results:
        The search term “iOS 8.1.3” gives “About 2 results found for 'ios 8.1.3'.”.
        “About”? Is the search engine not sure how many search results that give?


        https://www.apple.com/search/?section=global&geo=us&q=ios%208.1.3
        The results found are :

        APP for iPhone - UK and Ireland
        AppleCare Protection Plan for iPhone
        https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/applecare/appforiphoneuk.html

        AppleCare Protection Plan for iPad
        https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/applecare/appforipaduk.html

        Which BOTH are
        a) totally irrelevant to the search term
        b) do not even contain the search term
        c) are _exactly_ two unusable results

        No release notes article about the already available over-the-air update can be located for customers.



        Regression:
        This issue is not new, but has been persistent for a long time.
        Apple still doesn't seem to care enough about IT departments to provide them with information about updates for their users device's.
