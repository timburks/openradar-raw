    description: "Summary:\r\nWorking with Objective-C objects which have NSArray and NSDictionary properties is cumbersome and error prone in Swift, because the collections or members of the collection must constantly be cast to the expected type.\r\n\r\nThere should be annotations (similar to NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER) to annotate NSArray and NSDictionary properties with the types contained in them. Swift should automatically cast these collections to correctly typed collections when they are accessed, with expected runtime errors if the cast fails.\r\n\r\nThis would greatly simplify working with properties like UINavigationController.viewControllers or NSURL.pathComponents."
