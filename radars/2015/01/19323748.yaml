    description: "Summary:\r\nAn image view as content of a scroll view shows flashing white lines at the right and bottom corners while being zoomed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Have a single-view app that:\r\n- has a scroll view\r\n- with an image view\r\n- that shows an image and \r\n- allows zooming\r\n\r\nrun on iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- while zooming there should be no visual artefacts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- while zooming white lines appear on the right and bottom edges of the image view\r\n- A screenshot of the problem is attached. You can see the white lines on it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI looked if these white lines are from a background color that is \"shining through\", but that does not appear to be the case. A workaround I found is that you can set the image view's layer's border width to 2.0 and the border color to black. This will mask the white lines."
