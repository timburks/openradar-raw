        Summary:
        Now we cannot add target for Apple Watch’s digital crown events in WatchKit. I think it would be great if we can add them as the stepper event.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode 6.2 beta with WatchKit API
        2. Look for Apple Watch’s digital crown events

        Expected Results:
        Can add target-action for Apple Watch’s digital crown events

        Actual Results:
        Cannot add target-action for Apple Watch’s digital crown events

        Regression:


        Notes:
        Actually they might be used as a normal events, not just for stepper UI/event.
