    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile stepping through disassembly code in Xcode's debugger, the editor pane that shows the disassembly switches for a moment to another source file and then back to the disassembly view. This is a real impediment to debugging because it's hard to keep one's eyes trained on the assembly code that is being examined. Movie attached demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.2 (6C101)"
