    description: "Summary:\r\nConnecting to remote system using Screen Sharing is VERY slow.\r\n\r\nA connection from Yosemite (10.10.1) to a system running 10.6.8 takes over a minute every time.\r\n\r\nA connection from Yosemite (10.10.1) to a system running 10.10.1 takes about half a minute the first time. After that, it's immediate for awhile, but there's some kind of timeout where it starts being slow to connect again. (24 hours, maybe?)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Screen Sharing app.\r\n2. Connect to a server by hostname or IP address.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe connection should happen within a second or two.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe connection can take over a minute.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther apps, like Screens on iOS, connect to these same systems immediately. It doesn't seem like a problem on the remote end."
