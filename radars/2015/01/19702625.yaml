    description: "Scrolling with a table view with cells sized using UITableViewAutomaticDimension and estimatedRowHeight is very jumpy when returning to the view and scrolling towards the top of the table. Scrolling is ok in this situation if all of the cells are of the same size and you can provide an accurate estimatedRowHeight but when the cells are of varying height scrolling becomes very jumpy without an obvious solution for making scrolling smooth. \r\n\r\nIn our application we have a view with very varied dynamic cell heights, this is where the problem is most prevalent. We looked into implementing the delegate for estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath but this seemed to remove all benefit of using UITableViewAutomaticDimension. \r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nUsing the project provided: https://github.com/IndieGoGo/JumpyScrollExample\r\n\r\n1. scroll down until a number of cells have scrolled out of view \r\n2. tap one of the cells which will bring you to a new view, if you have Slow Animations on you will notice the table jump right before the transition starts \r\n3. press the Back button to go back to the table view \r\n4. scroll towards the top of the table, notice the cells are jumping, scrolling is not smooth\r\nThis would be a very poor experience for our users, we need the scrolling to be smooth when returning to the table view."
