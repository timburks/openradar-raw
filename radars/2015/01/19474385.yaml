        Summary:

        Text seems to be dictated correctly, but when dictation terminates, the dictated text is erased.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Open Mobile Safari and go to amazon.com or apple.com. (If you try apple.com, click the search icon.)
        2) Put the cursor in the search box.
        3) Click the microphone icon on the keyboard.
        4) Dictate a search phrase; the phrase appears in the text box.
        5) Click Done in the dictation feedback area; the phrase disappears.

        Expected Results:

        Dictated results should remain in the web form as dictated.
