        Summary:
        implicitly generated initializer of public classes should have public access control by default.
        When we have a public class and its properties have all default value, Swift will auto implicitly generate initializer. For the public class, I think those initializers should have public access control by default

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use this code
        public class APIEndPoint {
        	var count: Int = 0
        }

        In importing module try to create an  instance.
        let endPoint = APIEndPoint()

        Expected Results:
        implicitly generated initializer should have public access control

        Actual Results:
        Compiler failed because initializer has default access control.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
