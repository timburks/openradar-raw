    description: "There needs to be native support for bridging NSAttributedStrings to rich text in AppleScript-land. I know this is a hard problem, not least because different apps support it differently (see Omni’s research into what scripting classes are used: http://support.omnigroup.com/omnifocus-2-applescript-changes ). However, it’s a pain in the arse to have to iterate through everything and build your own NSAttributedString, and even more of a pain to do things the other way when you want to mutate things. \n\nWhen you do add this, please test support with both Mail (on the content property of a message) and OmniFocus (on the note property of a task)."
