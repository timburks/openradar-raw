    description: "Summary:\r\nFinder's 'ascrgdte' handler returns an AETE resource missing almost all class and command definitions. \r\n\r\nThis prevents AppleScripts that target the application via Remote Apple Events retrieving the remote app's terminology. (It also breaks third-party Apple event bridges that use 'ascrgdte' events to retrieve application terminology.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ntell application \"Finder\" to «event ascrgdte»\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should return Finder's full AppleScript dictionary. (AppleScript shows it as hex-encoded, but even without de-hexing it should run to several screens.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReturns a truncated AETE (<1K) containing only a single class definition.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA similar problem affected iTunes 10.6.3 (fixed in a subsequent release), and has also been observed in a few third-party apps. Only apps with Carbon-based scripting support appear to be affected. (Perhaps these apps are incorrectly enabling the Cocoa Scripting framework as well, causing the two to conflict?)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWorks on 10.6.8 and earlier. (No idea about 10.7, 10.8.) Breaks on 10.9.4, 10.10 DP5."
