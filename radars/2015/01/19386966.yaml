    description: "Summary:\r\nI work right next to a building where I used to work. The wi-fi network for the old building was still saved in my phone, and sometimes when walking to and from work would be joined by my phone, since it extends outside. Lately, however, the Wi-Fi password was changed, so every time I’m on my phone and I walk next to the building, I get prompted for the password. I don’t know what the new password is, however, so I can’t join the network. There is no UI on iOS that I can see to get to the “Forget This Network” button unless I connect to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Join a Wi-Fi network on an iOS device.\r\n2. Turn Wi-Fi off on the device.\r\n3. Change the password of the network.\r\n4. Turn Wi-Fi on on the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen prompted for the password once attempting to join the saved network fails, you will have the option to remove that network from your list of saved networks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEvery single time your device tries to connect to the network, it will prompt you for a password.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2 [12B440]"
