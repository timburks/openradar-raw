        Summary:
        I’m implementing a code editor using an NSTextView. As quote substitution, smart dashes etc. would be undesired there, I turn them off in IB. That doesn’t work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Take a XIB file with an NSTextView in it
        2) Bring up its Attributes Inspector
        3) Scroll down where it says “Substitution” and un-tick the checkboxes for “Smart Quotes” and “Smart Dashes”
        4) Build and run
        5) Type

        	put "This is some text" into card field 5 -- typical example script

        into the text view.

        Expected Results:
        6) The field should contain that literal text.

        Actual Results:
        6) The field contains

        	put “This is some text” into card field 5 — typical example script

        (Note the curly quotes even though smart quotes are off, and the single long em-dash replacing the 2 short minus signs) This code will not compile.

        Notes:
        A workaround is to set the properties in code. Like an animal.
