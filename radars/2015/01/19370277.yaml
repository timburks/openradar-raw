    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UI in a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium (Bootcamp with OSX Yosemite 10.10.1) on a Macbook Air 13\" Early 2014 has black areas which sometimes stay black and sometimes flash between the correct colour and black.\r\n\r\nThis only occurs after waking the laptop from sleeping. Restarting the computer fixes the problem, until the laptop sleeps then the problem returns.\r\n\r\nThe problems appear to affect Firefox and the task bar at the bottom of the screen the most. The attached image shows what Firefox looks like after waking from sleep. Disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox does not solve the problem.\r\n\r\nI tried to update from the Apple supplied graphics drivers (10.18.10.3960) to the latest version provided by Intel (15.36.7.64.3960) but windows/intel would not install the drivers (likely because it detected the laptop was a macbook and knew the installed drivers were already at the latest apple supplied version)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boot into Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium using Bootcamp\r\n2. Sleep the laptop (either by closing the lid, waiting for the time specified in the power options or from the start menu)\r\n3. Wake from sleep (press any keyboard button)\r\n4. Graphical glitches appear, including black areas in Firefox, missing menus in firefox and areas of the windows task bar that flicker between black and their normal colour\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo graphical issues when waking laptop from sleep.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGraphics glitches after waking from sleep.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWindows 7 SP1 64-bit Bootcamp with all updates installed\r\nFirefox 34.0.5\r\nOSX Yosemite 10.10.1 with all updates installed\r\nMacbook Air 13\" Early 2014 1.4ghz, 8gb RAM, 512GB SSD\r\nIntel graphics driver 10.18.10.3960 supplied by Apple Bootcamp installer\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Graphical errors after sleeping.JPG' was successfully uploaded."
