        Summary:
        Security content for new updates is not available

        Steps to Reproduce:
        OS X 10.10.2 and iOS 8.1.3 were just (2015-01-27 19:21 CET) released by Apple.
        Searching for 10.10.2 or 8.1.3 on Apple's support area doesn't yield ANY results about these updates or their security content.
        Not even the usually references kBase article 1222 is shown as a link to the central repository for security information.

        Sample searches that lead to ONLY irrelevant or even NO results at all:
        https://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&src=support_site.globalheader.search&locale=en_US&q=10.10.2
        https://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&locale=en_US&product=&q=8.1.3&src=support_site.kbase.search.searchresults
        https://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&locale=en_US&product=&q=kBase%201222&src=support_site.kbase.search.searchresults


        http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1222
        Does not contain timely security information.


        Expected Results:
        When Apple releases an update for OS X or iOS the corresponding update contents and security information should be readily available.


        Actual Results:
        Cricketsâ€¦ Security information often is delayed for days on the web.
        Apple's security mailing list has a delay of at least 24h plus time-zone differences.
        IT-Departments get necessary information about their user's devices and software updates way too late to react to security problems.


        Regression:
        This is a known problem with Apple documentation. Still, Apple doesn't provide IT-professionals with timely documentation for updates and especially security relevant data.
