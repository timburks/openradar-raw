    description: "Summary:\nDebug builds of Swift are nearly unusable. Seriously. Try building any type of responsive app that actually interacts with a bunch of Swift code, rather than just bridging into ObjC code, and you are plagued with terribly slow debug builds. Sure, the release builds are faster (though still 2x slower than the ObjC version), but itâ€™s terribly annoying debugging release builds all the time.\n\nA sample project is here: https://github.com/owensd/handmade-swift/tree/day005_badperf \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\n\nExpected Results:\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\n\nActual Results:\nExplain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.\n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
