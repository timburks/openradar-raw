    description: "Summary:\r\nSuper weird bug. Someone noticed this in my app Deliveries: tap Share, tap Mail, then type some text into the HTML template the app supplies. If you mistype a word, autocorrect will change it, but then add an extra letter in front. If there is any text after, then it will also eat the first character. So it seems like it's basically inserting the corrected text using the wrong character offset.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app. All it does is load an HTML file and give it to UIActivityViewController, then present it. The specific CSS used is what triggers the bug.\r\n2. Tap Mail when the share sheet appears.\r\n3. Tap in the body of the message.\r\n4. Type \"whem\" (or some other word that is not spelled correctly)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"whem\" should be changed to \"when\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"whem\" becomes \"wwhen\", and the character immediately after the insertion point is removed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 (12D5461b), Xcode 6.2 (6C107a).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe really weird part of this bug is the workaround: in Email.html, just remove the width and from the a.icon CSS class. This doesn't even affect the way the text is laid out.\r\n\r\nThe bug is also present on iOS 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, not sure about earlier versions.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation, 32GB. Also tested on iPhone 6."
