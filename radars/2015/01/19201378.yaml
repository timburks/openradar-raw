    description: "I am running 10.10.1 and OS-X Server on a late 2012 Mac mini with fusion drive. I'm running with 16 GByte of RAM, two external USB 3.0 drives, and two monitors.\r\n\r\nThe local Time Machine backups appear to be happening correctly. I can browse the backups directly using the finder as hinted at by the screenshot. The problem is that when I \"enter TimeMachine\" - either by opening the \"O\" on the dock and selecting \"Enter Time Machine\" or by running Time Machine from the application folder, the main screen goes blank and never achieves the space warp/Star Wars screen. I say \"never\" - I have waited ~30 minutes and the screen remains blank. I can press \"esc\" and get back to normal operation. I have attached a screen shot taken on return to normality (second attachment, 06.16.05). On one occasion I have had the system monitor open on my second screen and this shows only a very small amount of disk traffic - I did not notice anything else strange.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click on Time Machine icon (\"O\") on the dock. \r\n2. Click on \"Enter Time Machine\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see the Time Machine Space Warp browser.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get a blank screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1\r\n\r\nNB - TIMEMACHINE WORKS CORRECTLY WITH A SINGLE MONITOR"
