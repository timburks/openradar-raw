    description: "I wanted to send the following AppleScript to OmniFocus:\n\n\t\tset value of attribute named \"link\" of style of characters 1 thru 9 of note of myTask to urlString\n\nThe problem was that I could not work out how to send things to a range of items inside a collection, without sending separate Apple Events for each character. \n\nThis could be solved with a makeObjectsInRange:performSelector: method on SBElementArray. The underlying problem is that I should be able to send, in one single Apple Event, any getter/setter that AppleScript could manage to send in one Apple Event."
