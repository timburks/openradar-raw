        Maybe that was PowerPlant or TCL or MacZoop or whatever I was using back then, but in Ye Olde Carbon Daysâ„¢, any view (even completely transparent plain HIViews and other containers, not just actual controls) had an "enabled" property that allowed to disable not only it, but also all its subviews.

        This was very useful for single-window UI, because you could just disable a whole area of the window that wasn't applicable instead of having to manually pick each item in it, e.g. to deactivate certain UI while a progress bar is up.

        Another nice feature of this was that each view actually had three enabled states: enabled, latently enabled, and disabled. If a view is disabled directly, its state becomes disabled. If a view is just disabled because its superview is disabled, it becomes latently enabled (which displays the same as disabled). That way, re-enabling a view restores the enable state of its subviews.

        Would be great if NSView could get this feature, too. Thanks.
