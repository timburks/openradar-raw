    description: "Summary:\r\n> NOTE: this is a dup of 18397373. This issue is having significant impact on an indoor mapping project\r\n\r\nAs of iOS 8 the MKMapView maximum zoom level has been reduced from 21 to 20. This has significant impacts for indoor mapping solutions built on top of MKMapView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip MKMapViewSample.zip\r\n2. Run MKMapViewSample on Xcode 5 targeting an iOS 7 iPhone (simulator or device).\r\n3. Notice the overlay sample encompasses the the entire view .\r\n4. Now, open MKMapViewSample in Xcode 6.\r\n5. Run MKMapViewSample with Xcode 6 targeting an iOS 8 iPhone (simulator or device).\r\n6. Notice that the maximum zoom level is much less than iOS 7.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaximum zoom level to be the same or better in iOS 8.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMaximum zoom level on iOS 8 is much worse than iOS 7.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A365) and 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe were hoping that the maximum zoom level would improve in iOS 8 to better enable indoor mapping applications built on top of MKMapView. The current zoom level makes indoor mapping solutions built on top of MKMapView untenable except for very large venues.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S AT&T using WiFi, iPhone 5 AT&T using WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
