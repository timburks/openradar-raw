    description: "Summary:\r\nThe tableView:didEndEditingRowAtIndexPath: delegate method is not being called if the swipe-to-edit gesture is cancelled with the editing actions opened too little.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem if you have a UIButton inside the table view cell, because if you start the swipe-to-delete gesture over the button, then both the button as well as the editing action are executed. The provided delegate methods would allow me to enable/disable interaction with this button during editing. \r\n\r\nBut this issue allows for a state to occur where the editing actions are not visible, but the button still being disabled. So the user would have to tap once to get the delegate method to fire and re-enable user interaction and another time to actually tap the button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Run the provided sample app\r\n2) Swipe any row to the left\r\n3) Note that it turns red\r\n4) tap anywhere to have the editing end, it turns green again\r\n5) Now swipe to the left, but only so far that the cell text begins to touch the left edge of the screen, then let go\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the editing actions should be hidden\r\n- the tableView:didEndEditingRowAtIndexPath: should be called when they are\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- editing actions are hidden\r\n- tableView:didEndEditingRowAtIndexPath: is not called called\r\n- when you start scrolling the table view, it is called TWICE\r\n\r\nI expect the \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIndeed the tableView:didEndEditingRowAtIndexPath: is called TWICE even during normal operation of showing the actions. Should I file another bug report for that?"
