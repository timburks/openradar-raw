    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user has items awaiting download in iTunes, there is an option to \"Download Now\" but no control over what to download or not download. There should be better control over this. Users should be able to select what to download and what to ignore. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important when presented with repeated \"unknown error occurred (8268)\" errors because there is no way to tell iTunes not to attempt downloading this item (which was downloaded already, in 2008).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch iTunes\r\n2. From the Store menu, select Store->View Account \r\n3. Sign-in\r\n4. Note that there is a Download Now button without any indication of what content is awaiting download.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see a \"view items awaiting download\" button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see a \"Download Now\" button without any indication of what content is awaiting download. Then a few seconds later I get an error 8268 which makes this even more annoying because I cannot cancel the download attempt every time I launch iTunes."
