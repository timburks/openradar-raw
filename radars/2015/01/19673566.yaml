    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen sharing a photo from the Photos app into a message thread, one can tap to the right of the photo to start typing a caption. However, after typing the first letter of your caption, the cursor jumps to before the first letter, so that if you're trying to type something like \"what\", you end up with \"hatw\". This has been broken since at least iOS 8.1.0, but I want to say all the way back to 8.0.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Photos.app\r\n2. Open a photo that you want to share\r\n3. Tap the Share button\r\n4. Tap Message in the share sheet\r\n5. Tap to the right of the photo in the message composition view so that you can start typing a caption\r\n6. Start typing. After typing the first letter, the cursor will jump one character to the left, jumbling the word you're trying to type\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor should always remain to the right of whatever I'm currently typing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor jumps to the left after the first character, jumbling up the caption I'm trying to type\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64 GB Verizon, Wi-Fi or LTE"
