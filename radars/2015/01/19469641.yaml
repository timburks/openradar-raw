        Summary:

        When an APP provides settings with a Settings.bundle and opens this settings view with

        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString]];

        the view initially only contains the privacy settings and not any entry from the Settings bundle.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. create an APP with a Settings.bundle
        2. request access from the PHAssets or ALAssetLibrary
        3. call openURL with the system constant UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString

        Expected Results:
        APP switches to System settings and its APP settings view with all fields from the privacy settings AND the contents of the settings bundle.

        Actual Results:
        Only the privacy settings appear in the view.

        Regression:
        iOS 8, on device debugging

        Notes:
        When the user goes back from the APP settings to the general settings and re-enters the APP settings, the entries from the settings bundle will appear but this is a huge bug from a UX perspective.
