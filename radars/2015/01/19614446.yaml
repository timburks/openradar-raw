    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, when I go to the “Flagged” mailbox on the left pane in Mail, right-click on a flagged message, and click the X to remove the flag, it’s removed, but the “1” badge on the Flagged mailbox remains until I close the window and re-open it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a message that’s flagged.\r\n2. Click on “Flagged” on the left side of the main Mail window to open the list of flagged messages.\r\n3. Right-click on the flagged message and remove the flag.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe “Flagged” mailbox on the left will not have a badge of “1,” since now there are no flagged messages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe badge remains.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 8.1 (1993) on OS X Version 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a Gmail account, and the messages that seem to do this the most are “Starred” in Gmail using server-side filter as they come in."
