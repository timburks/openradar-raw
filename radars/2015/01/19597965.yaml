    description: "Summary:\r\nAdd enough songs to Up Next that the list scrolls, and it becomes impossible to double-click the top item\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Stop iTunes and clear Up Next\r\n2. Add enough songs to Up Next that the list must scroll\r\n3. Double-click the first song in the list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first song gets selected and starts to play\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first click causes the Up Nextlist to scroll down, and then the second click selects the second track, and starts it playing, so the first song gets skipped over\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don’t recall it happening in iTunes 11, but can’t be sure\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround is to single-click the first item in Up Next, scroll the list back to the top, and then double-click it"
