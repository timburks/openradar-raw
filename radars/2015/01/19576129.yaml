    description: "Link to project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ytcz4m83jcdccfs/Test_UINavigationBar_ButtonItem_Jump.zip?dl=0\r\nLink to video demo: https://www.dropbox.com/s/d4gnfrgsz2nblz0/Action_Extension_nav_bar_button_jump.mov?dl=0\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you present a modal with a navigation controller and a bar button item in the navigation item, that button jumps if you're in an Action Extension. If you're in the normal app it is fine.\r\n\r\nThe video I attached demos this. And the project is in the zip attached\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild the project in the zip attached\r\nOpen Photos app and select an image and open the TestActionExtension action extension\r\nIf you tap the \"Test\" cell, a modal will be presented\r\nThe right bar button item of that modal jumps to the left as the presentation ends\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the button not to jump, as it is the case in the main app. You can see the video or build the app for that\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does jump to the left\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator iPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Action_Extension_nav_bar_button_jump.mov' and 'Test_UINavigationBar_ButtonItem_Jump.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS FIXED ON iOS 9.0"
