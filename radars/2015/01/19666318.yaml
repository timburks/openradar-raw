    description: "Summary:\r\nTestFlight betas expire after 30 days, so all of our testers will be locked out of our app once it expires. The App Store version of the the same build has been approved and is on the store, but it doesn't auto-install over the TF build. I think it should. It's the same build and it won't expire. \r\n\r\nThis issue will lead developers to constantly re-issue unchanged TF builds to keep their testers happy, or to have to implement custom communication telling their testers to jump in and out of the test. \r\n\r\nIf I subsequently release a new beta, the user can be notified and then choose to switch back to that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Release a TestFlight beta\r\n2. Test and confirm the build works as expected\r\n3. Submit for review, get approved.\r\n4. Wait 30 days.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected that when the app store version was approved, it would install over the Test Flight beta with the same build / version number.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTest Flight beta expires and beta users' apps simply crash on launch. Users are confused, likely to delete and re-install (losing data), and nervous about joining future betas.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnly work around is to avoid the 30 day limit by continuously re-submitting the same build to testers every 30 days.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"

    title: App Store releases of the same or greater build should automatically over-write Test Flight beta installs.
