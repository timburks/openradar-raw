    description: "Summary:\r\nThe time zone is dropped when adding a Genius Bar appointment to the calendar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Genius Bar appointment at a store in another time zone\r\n2. Select “Add to Calendar”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the appointment to be added to my calendar at the appointment time in that store’s time zone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy current time zone is used.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor example, if I’m in New York, and I make a 1:45pm appointment at the Chicago Apple Store, the appointment should be added to my calendar at 1:45pm Central Time. Instead, the appointment is added to my calendar at 1:45pm Eastern Time, which will be off by 1 hour once I get to Chicago."
