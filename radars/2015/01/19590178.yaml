    description: "Summary:\r\nPasswords saved in Safari, or synced through iCloud Keychain should be searchable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Settings » Safari » Passwords & AutoFill » Saved Passwords\r\n2. Try to find the password for a specific domain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should be able to scroll up, revealing a search field (as in almost every other native app), which they can use to find the password they’re looking for.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser must scroll through an impossibly long list of domains, that seems to be in no discernible order.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEven just ordering the list alphabetically, and hiding the protocol (http/https) would be a huge help in finding passwords."
