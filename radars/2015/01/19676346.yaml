        On my Mac Mini, the following Swift code yields the error shown:

            let z = Array(0...4)
            let two = 2

            // "Expression was to complex to be solved in reasonable time"
            let doesntWork = two * z[0] + two * z[1] + z[2] + z[3] + z[4]

        I understand that the type solver is not optimized yet, but this expression is so type-constrained that I wonder if there isn’t an outright bug somewhere. All the variables are Ints, and all the subscripts have to be interpreted as Ints, so I’m not seeing any obvious places where a choice of interpretation must be made.
