    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a third party keyboard is set as the primary keyboard, Spotlight sometimes refuses to show any keyboard at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a third party keyboard and make it the primary keyboard (I use SwiftKey)\r\n2. Power cycle your iPhone\r\n3. invoke spotlight from the springboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected spotlight to show a keyboard so that I could type the !@#$&%^ query.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo keyboard is shown at all, making it impossible to enter any search text.  The spotlight search field with blinking cursor just sits there, mocking me.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs in iOS8.1 (not sure about 8.0) when a third party keyboard (SwiftKey) is installed as the current/primary keyboard.  It seems to be easily reproducible, but doesnâ€™t occur every time.  \r\n\r\nNotes:"
