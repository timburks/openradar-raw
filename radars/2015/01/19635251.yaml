    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, pages such as http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1785 don't load in Safari. They load fine in Chrome.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click a link to an Apple kb article, such as http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1785\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPage loads in Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPage is blank. The loading indicator indicates that the page has finished loading. When I view source, the DOM is completely empty (no tags at all).\r\n\r\nIf I load the same page in Chrome, it works fine every time. I've attached the Charles Proxy results for the request and response of both Safari 8.0.3 (10600.3.18) and Chrome 40.0.2214.93 (64-bit) on OS X 10.10.2 (14C109) and Charles Proxy 3.9.3.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this is not a network issue. If I alternate between browsers, Safari always fails and Chrome always loads.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0.3 (10600.3.18) on OS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNavigating to another Apple support page in Safari (in this case, http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204) and then back has fixed the issue (for now). But I don't doubt it will reappear, as it has in the past.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple kb articles are the only pages where I have ever seen this. I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen every single time. I think I've seen them load sometimes in Safari.\r\n\r\nInstalled extensions in Safari:\r\n1Password (beta)\r\nAdblock Plus\r\nExifExt\r\nTinEye\r\nInstapaper\r\n\r\nBut when I disable all extensions, the page still comes up blank.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nscreenshots and Charles output: http://cl.ly/ZV67"
