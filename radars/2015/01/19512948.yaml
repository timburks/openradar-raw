    description: "I am getting some crashes related to releasing the error result returned by SMJobSubmit.  Crashes began with 10.10, so this appears to be a regression.  Crashlog attached.  I have not seen this myself, but I have received about 70 crashlogs with this crash in it.\r\n\r\n\t\tCFErrorRef error;\r\n\t\tif ( SMJobSubmit( kSMDomainSystemLaunchd, CFBridgingToCFDictionary(plist), auth, &error) ) {\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif ( error ) CFRelease( error );\r\n\r\nSo either SMJobSubmit is returning success and not setting the error value to NULL, or is returning an invalid or already released error result on failure."
