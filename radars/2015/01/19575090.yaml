    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I create an empty Action Extension on my project I'll get the default implementation that has a Done button and loads an image in an imageView. If you tap twice in the share sheet to open that extension the Done button is unresponsive and does not close the extension. The user has to quit the containing app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate the default action extension\r\nGo into photos app, select a photo and tap twice on the action extension you created\r\nDone button will not work and you'll have to close the photos app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou'd expect that the system does not allow another tap on the same or any other extension until the current extension is done (or at least done loading). The second tap should no-op\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get into a state where the extensions seems to be presented multiple times and canceling it from the Done button does not work. You are now stuck and forced to kill the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
