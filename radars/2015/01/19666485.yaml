    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a Test Flight build expires and a user tries to open it, the app looks like it’s launching and then closes. This appears to the user like a crash. There’s no hint about what has happened however, so a user will not know to either install the app store version or wait for a new release.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Release a TF beta.\r\n2. Let it expire after 30 days.\r\n3. Try to launch it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS should notify the user that the app has expired.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app appears to crash.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways happens.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also radar #19666318 - not fixing this issue will lead developers to continuously re-submit the same unchanged build, just to get around the expiry time limit."

    title: Expired Test Flight builds should inform the user why they can't launch instead of just closing.
