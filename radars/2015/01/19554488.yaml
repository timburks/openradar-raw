    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, test bundles cannot be created for app extensions. In order to write tests for an extension, you have to extract out the testable pieces of code into their own framework, which doesn't always make sense architecturally. You should be able to easily write unit tests for app extensions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create extension\r\n2. Write unit tests for extension in its own test bundle\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to easily write unit tests for an app extension.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou need to copy all of the testable code into a separate framework in order to write unit tests."
