        Summary:
        When opening Xcode in several situations, but most consistently with the steps given below, the full screen projects will be restored full screen and off screen, as they should be. However, the first time you switch to the fullscreen window it pauses for a second and then exits fullscreen. Whatâ€™s worse, often times multiple fullscreen projects will be hidden behind a single fullscreen project, and will only appear again when the project exits fullscreen.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open one or more Xcode projects fullscreen.
        2. From the desktop, restart the Mac.
        3. Wait for all the apps to restore.
        4. Switch to a fullscreen Xcode project either by swiping to it with a trackpad or from mission control.

        Expected Results:
        Xcode should restore exactly as it was before and remain fullscreen when switching to it.

        Actual Results:
        The project exits fullscreen.
