    description: "Summary:\r\nAdding a WKInterfaceGroup to a WKInterfaceTable and setting the background color doesn't always give the group rounded bottom corners, only top, even with the radius is set to default in the storyboard inspector. It ends up with top rounded corners and bottom normal, straight corners.\r\n\r\nThe workaround to this is to explicitly set the radius of the group to 6pt.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen more with bigger scenes, so in order to reproduce, you may need to add several different groups and items to the interface.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a WKInterfaceGroup to WKInterfaceTable\r\n2. Change background color of WKInterfaceGroup so that you can definitely see the rounded corners (may not be necessary, I'm honestly not sure because I can't reproduce this 100% of the time).\r\n3. Run the app. The top corners are rounded but the bottom corners are not when set to default radius.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe corners on top and bottom should be rounded when set to default radius. I should not have to explicitly set the radius to 6pt.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe corners on the bottom are not rounded by default. I have to explicitly set the radius to 6pt.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 4, Apple Watch simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch simulator"
