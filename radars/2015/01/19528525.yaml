    description: We’ve noticed inconsistent behavior with starting a background audio session from the Watch to the Phone. Using the openParentApplication method usually works very well to ask the phone to perform some task, but starting a background session doesn’t always work the first time. Sometimes it requires a few requests before it kicks in and stays awake.
