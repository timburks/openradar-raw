    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, in Guided Access Mode, after 5 consecutive crashes iOS will stop opening the app and stay on the Home Screen. This makes sense if the app is crashing within seconds of launching, because otherwise the user would be trapped in a never-ending app relaunch cycle with no escape.\r\n\r\nAs of iOS 8, we have found that apps slowly eat up memory and eventually crash out. We vigilantly work to avoid memory leaks in our own code, but several Apple frameworks we depend on are known to leak themselves. It can take weeks to happen, but eventually and inevitably after a month or so 5 crashes will cause the device to return to the homescreen and stay there.\r\n\r\nBetter behavior would be if the automatic disabling of Guided Access Mode worked off of the number of crashes within a time window, and not just an absolute number of crashes. If there have been 5 crashes within the last x minutes or seconds, then disable Guided Access Mode. This would allow the automatic disabling to still save users from apps that crash on launch, without harming the apps that crash rarely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set device in Guided Access Mode.\r\n2. Let crashes happen 5 times.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGuided Access Mode stays enabled *if* 5 crashes have happened over the course of long time frame. It gets disabled if 5 crashes if it happens over a short time frame.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGuided Access Mode gets disabled after 5 crashes regardless of time frame."
