    description: "When the “Subject” field is filled, Messages sends text messages via MMS if the recipient isn’t on iMessage. For most carriers (at least in Europe/Germany) this creates significant extra costs compared to SMS.\r\n\r\niOS should warn the user if he really wants to send the message as a costly MMS - at least if no multimedia content is provided."
