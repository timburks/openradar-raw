    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://19435810\n\nWhen sending emails to other people the new mail template doesn't allow for sending mails encrypted even if the S/MIME option and certificate is setup properly on the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup certificates and mail account to be able to send mails encrypted\r\n2. Have another person's public key imported \r\n2. Open Photos\r\n3. Select a picture\r\n4. Choose to mail it to the recipient you have the public key imported\r\n5. You won't be see the encryption options in the mail header fields\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs if I used the native Mail app within iOS, I would expect to see that I am able to send out mails encrypted from any app (also Apple's own) - not only from Mail itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly Mail shows the option to send mails encrypted; all other apps donâ€™t."
