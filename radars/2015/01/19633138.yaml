        Summary:
        In Xcode, there is a long-standing bug that toggling open multiple trees (for instance, folders in the Project Navigator view or IB Document Outline elements) collapses entire tree. It seems that you must wait for the tree-opening animation to complete before toggling open a second element or the entire tree collapses to its root, and you lose the entire expand/collapse state of the tree.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open a project in Xcode that contains a multi-level directory structure
        - Show the Project Navigator view
        - Attempt to expand several directories quickly

        Expected Results:
        Best case: both directories expand.
        Better, but not best case: Only the first directory expands, and the second interaction is suppressed/ignored.

        Actual Results:
        The entire tree collapses
