    description: "Summary:\r\nScheduling of local notifications is done with this line of code:\r\n\r\nUIApplication.sharedApplication().scheduleLocalNotification(notification)\r\n\r\nSince UIApplication.sharedApplication() is not available from an app extension, it is impossible to schedule local notifications (it is also impossible to cancel scheduled notifications).\r\n\r\nIt is always possible to do so by launching the main app using an url scheme and then having the main app schedule/cancel the notification. However it is most defenitely not user-friendly to yank the user out of the app they're in just to shedule/cancel a notification on the main app and then have the main app just sit there without doing anything.\r\n\r\nThere are many uses for scheduling notifications from within extensions, specially from within Today Extensions. However, it is impossible to do so right now (as far as I can tell). Here are some examples of why this is useful:\r\n\r\n - A list of upcoming movies is displayed on a today extension and the user taps on one of the movies to schedule a notification to alert him that the movie is now available in theaters\r\n\r\n - A reminders app shows a list of reminders and users can toggle whether a reminder should present a notification or not (this involves both scheduling and canceling notifications)\r\n\r\n - A to-do app shows a list of tasks and allows for to-dos to be completed by tapping on them. A to-do can have scheduled notifications associated with it and when a to-do is completed those notifications should be cancelled (imagine having to switch to the main app just to cancel the notification...).\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding this feature. It would make extensions even more powerful for developers and users alike.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
