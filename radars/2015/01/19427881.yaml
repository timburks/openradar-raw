    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://19382113\n\nSummary:\r\nWindows don't repaint correctly over a VNC connection. Portions of windows don't redraw and pieces of other windows are left around on screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a system running 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n2. Use it for awhile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe windows should repaint correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEventually the windows will fail to repaint.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround is to disable beam sync in Quartz Debug. After the beam sync is disabled, the windows repaint correctly.\r\n\r\nNote that I can't take a screenshot of this because doing so causes all the corrupted windows to repaint.\r\n\r\nThis problem looks like the same thing that happens when using a virtual machine (like VMware) on Yosemite: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/improving-yosemite-vm-performance-in-vmware-fusion/\r\n\r\nI find this corruption whether I’m using Screens.app - Apple Screen Sharing app - Apple Remote Desktop. It’s irritating and sometimes fatal when supporting a remote server with a low bandwidth connection. Dropping the resolution only works so far and interacting with Time Machine to restore files remotely is a real pain when the screen repaint is so buggy and full of garbage when things get garbled."
