    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS simulator should be able to zoom to sizes larger than 1:1 on Retina displays.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run an app in iOS simulator on a Mac with a Retina display.\r\n2. Want to look at something up close in the simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can press Command 4 or Command 5, or perhaps Command +/- to zoom the simulator up to 200%, 400%, or larger, as I would in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe simulator will not zoom larger than 1 iOS pixel = 1 Mac pixel. On a Mac with a Retina display, this means the simulator is only slightly larger than life size. Especially when running a Retina Mac at higher than native 2x resolution (e.g. a 13” Retina MacBook Pro at 1440x900 HiDPI), this makes it hard to tell what’s going on at the pixel level without taking a screenshot and zooming in in Preview or Photoshop.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is not (as much of) a problem on non-Retina Macs, just because the pixels are larger. But even there, sizes larger than 1:1 would be useful."
