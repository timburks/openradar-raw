        Summary:
        Thereâ€™s no way to remove Facebook events in calendar without Internet connection

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Configure your iOS device to show Facebook events in the calendar
        2. Get invited to a Facebook event
        3. Turn on Airplane Mode or walk into an underground tunnel
        4. Try to delete the Facebook event

        Expected Results:
        I expect to be able to decline the Facebook invitation from the iOS calendar app, and have it be removed immediately. If no Internet connection is available, I expect this action to be communicated to Facebook when one does become available.

        This is consistent with how other event invitations work.

        Actual Results:
        I cannot remove the event without launching the Facebook app and waiting for the content to load, which requires an Internet connection.
