    description: "NSAppleEventDescriptor currently provides methods for packing and unpacking most - but not all - commonly used descriptorTypes. The attached patch contains six additional convenience methods:\r\n\r\n+descriptorWithDouble:\r\n+descriptorWithFileURL:\r\n+descriptorWithProcessID:\r\n+descriptorWithApplicationURL:\r\n-doubleValue\r\n-fileURLValue\r\n\r\nThese methods are not essential as all of these values can be packed and unpacked as raw bytes using NSAppleEventDescriptor's -descriptorWithDescriptorType: bytes:length: and -data methods. However, adding these methods to NSAppleEventDescriptor would make the process much less painful and error prone.\r\n\r\n(To minimize patch size, -processIDValue and -applicationURLValue are not included. Descriptors of these types are frequently used in +appleEventWithEventClass:eventID:targetDescriptor:returnID:transactionID: to identify the target process, but are rarely used elsewhere so there is little need to unpack them again.)\r\n\r\nWhile the patch has been implemented as a category (NSAppleEventDescriptor+AEDescMoreExtensions), this was done for testing purposes only. I recommend inserting these methods directly into the NSAppleEventDescriptor class.\r\n\r\nThis code is taken from my existing AppleEventBridge project (https://bitbucket.org/hhas/appleeventbridge/), originally released under the BSD/MIT License but now released into the public domain. Apple is free to incorporate these six methods into its own codebase and place its own copyright upon them."
