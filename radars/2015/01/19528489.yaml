    description: "Summary: $ is used in prefix form in swift for retrieving arguments by position in closures.  This still leaves infix and postfix form open for user defined operators, or even operators that just use $ somewhere in the name (notably <$>).  Swift should not reserve $ so greedily just because it is used in one particular feature of its syntax.  Strangely, $ is already allowed as an identifier in every other language construct, but not for operators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1.  Attempt to define any operator whose identifier contains the character $\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Swift allows such an identifier to be defined without error.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Swift considers all identifiers containing $ to be invalid.\r\n\r\nVersion: Xcode 6.2 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
