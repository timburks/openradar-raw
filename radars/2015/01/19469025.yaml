    description: "Summary:\r\nI recently updated by Silverlight plugin. The plugin was set to \"Ask\" before allowing to run. However after updating the plugin, I discovered it being defaulted to \"Allow\". The result was that this plugin, however disallowed to run, was allowed on all websites and could have been used as an attack vector on my machine. Setting a plugin to \"Ask\", should never revert back to \"Allow\" after updating.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install old version of Silverlight plugin\r\n2. Set plugin to \"Ask\" before run\r\n3. Update to new version of Silverlight plugin\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Security setting reverted to \"Allow\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Security setting should not revert to \"Allow\", but remain at \"Ask\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.1, Safari 8.0.2"
