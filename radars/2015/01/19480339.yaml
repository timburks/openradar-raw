        Summary:

        Running Screen Sharing on a system with multiple displays is unusable. Both mouse movement is erratic and keyboard keystrokes are not recorded.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Open Screen Sharing to a remote machine with multiple displays

        Expected Results:

        You should be able to use the system normally

        Actual Results:

        Both mouse and keyboard events are never delivered to the remote system. Screen redraw is very blocky, also.

        Regression:

        This worked fine in 10.9 and earlier.

        Notes:

        The system is usable if you don’t use the “Both Displays” setting in the Screen Sharing toolbar.
