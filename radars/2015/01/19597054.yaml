    description: "Summary:\r\nThe storyboard attached is in some way fundamentally broken. With Auto Layout on, I am unable to edit it. When I do try to edit the storyboard by changing the size of an object, Xcode crashes and gives me the attached Crash Log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode Project.\r\n2. Add the attached MainStoryboard-iPad.storyboard to the Xcode Project.\r\n3. Add a UIButton to one of the view controllers in the storyboard.\r\n4. Attempt to resize the UIButton.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to edit the size of the UIButton with Xcode crashing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes as I drag one of the sides of the UIButton in an attempt to resize it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1\r\nOS X 10.10.2 Yosemite\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MainStoryboard-iPad.storyboard' and 'Xcode Crash Log.txt' were successfully uploaded."
