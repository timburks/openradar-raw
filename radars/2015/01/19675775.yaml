    description: "Summary:\r\nIn some cases, Interface Builder will create Auto Layout constraints that have a 0.5pt constant. When these constraints are created, IB can lay out views successfully and report no conflicts or ambiguities; however, at runtime, these constraints can conflict with others due to the half point offset that IB seems to discard. The constant is not shown in the Attributes inspector; instead, it is reported as \"0\" (or \"-0\" if the constant is -0.5pt). However, opening the relevant .xib or .storyboard in an XML editor reveals the actual constant value.\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample app that illustrates this behavior. Open the Main.storyboard file and set the size classes to compact width/regular height. In IB, there are no reported Auto Layout problems, but in a portrait iPhone 6, the console logs two conflicts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project\r\n2. Run on a portrait iPhone 6 Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince IB shows no Auto Layout problems for the compact width/regular height case, I expect no exceptions logged to the console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo Auto Layout constraint conflict exceptions are logged to the console.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 (6C107a) / OS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Simulator in portrait orientation\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'HWAdaptiveWeather.zip' was successfully uploaded."
