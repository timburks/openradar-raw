    description: "Summary:\r\nDocument based applications should hook the Print… menu to “printDocument:” but when a document based application is created using a storyboard the Print menu is hooked to “print:” and “printDocument:” must be defined by the user, which is very non-intuitive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a project in Xcode and choose Cocoa Application.\r\n2. Choose document-based and storyboard (Core Data is indifferent)\r\n3. View Main.storyboard > Main Menu > File > Print… \r\n4. Look at its Connections inspector\r\n5. See that Sent Actions is hooked up to “print:”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe print methods on the NSDocument subclass will never get called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nprint: is hijacked somewhere else in the responder chain (still not quite sure where).\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n1. Choose First Responder in Main.storyboard\r\n2. Choose Attributes Inspector\r\n3. Add a User Defined Action for “printDocument:”\r\n4. Hook the Print menu’s selector up to printDocument.\r\n\r\nNow the print methods are called as expected."
