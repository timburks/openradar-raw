    description: I’ve noticed that multiple calls to setRowsNamed will generally not update the table correctly. Usually the table will not update at all, meaning that if you specified a different number of rows and different content for the rows that the original table would remain set. I’ve also seen this crash a few times, though that seems to happen less frequently. When I’ve seen this happen the setRowsNamed method and corresponding updates to the various row controllers are called in immediate succession. The work around was to force the table not to be updated twice in succession.
