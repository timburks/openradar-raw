    description: "NSUserNotificationCenter assigns it's delegate leading to crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\nSet a temporary object as the NSUserNotificationCenter delegate, present the notification, exit the scope so the object is deallocated, the app crashes.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\nThe deallocation of the weak delegate should make it become nil and messaging nil shouldn't crash the app.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\r\nThe deallocation of the assigned delegate crashes the app.\r\n\r\nSample project: http://cl.ly/ZI9K"
