    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you attempt to share an app from the App Store's Updates tab (on iOS) by tapping the action button, the URL is missing. From any other tab the shared items include the app name, the app URL, and the app icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the App Store on an iOS device.\r\n2. Switch to the Updates tab\r\n3. Tap the icon of any recently updated app. One tap reveals the full release notes, the second tab opens the app preview page with screenshots and a full description.\r\n4. Tap the Action/Share button on the right side of the navigation bar.\r\n5. Share the results with Mail, Twitter, Messages, etc., or \"Copy Link\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new share sheet should be opened, including the app name, an app store short link, and the app icon. Depending on which share action is done, some combination of these will be available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo matter which share action is done, including \"copy link\". The link is not included... only the app name and app icon.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Photo 2015-01-05, 10 00 40 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
