        Summary:
        Since I cannot prevent my own sharing extension from showing in the list when a user has not configured an account, my extension needs to be able to send the user to my app to configure an account.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Download and install my app
        2. Open another app and try to use my sharing extension
        3. Be disappointed because you have not setup an account and I cannot send you to the app to do so.
        4. Hunt around on your home screen to find my app and launch it yourself.

        Expected Results:
        My extension could just launch my app to help you setup an account.

        Actual Results:
        You’re left with a bad experience and you’re kind of lost.

        Regression:
        This never worked ever.

        Notes:
        Thanks for your time!
