    description: "Initial note: Voice Over with standard configurations activated. Rotor is on 'actions'.\r\n\r\nHaving the cursor (the rectangle marker VoiceOver uses, I'll call it cursor) on a conversation (i.e. a row in the \"Messages\" TableView) in Messages.app and swiping up circles through \"Delete\" and \"Activate item\". Double tap after \"Delete\" and the conversation is gone. \r\nAlright, now enter a conversation, set the cursor on a message. Say you want to delete that message; you'd expect to do the same - repeatedly swipe up until \"Delete\", but nope. Just \"More\" and \"Activate item\". Of course, one who does this task being able to see knows, \"More\" hides a selection mode behind it and gives you the ability to delete all the selected messages at once by tapping the dedicated button in the lower left corner (btw: how is a blind person supposed to get the view-transition from message field to sort of task bar??), but all these steps are way too complicated to do more often. Since there is such an easy and well thought through way with conversation, why not add that \"Delete\" action to single messages too??\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(0. Activate VoiceOver.)\r\n1. Open a conversation.\r\n2. Select a message.\r\n3. Set rotor to \"actions\".\r\n4. Swipe up repeatedly\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Open a conversation.\r\n2. Select a message.\r\n3. Set rotor to \"actions\".\r\n4. Swipe up until \"Delete\" action.\r\n5. Double tap after \"Delete\" action is chosen.\r\n6. Message deleted. Boom - that easy!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Open a conversation.\r\n2. Select a message.\r\n3. Set rotor to \"actions\".\r\n4. Swipe up -> \"More\".\r\n5. Swipe up again -> \"Activate item\" (why does that even exist there??)\r\n6. Swipe up -> \"More\". Apparently no \"Delete\" there."
