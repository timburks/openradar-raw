    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a UITableViewController subclass, if you call presentViewController:animated:completion: from within your implementation of tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath: it can take a very long time (sometimes several seconds) to present the view controller.\r\n\r\nIf you push the view controller onto the Navigation Controller stack, there is no delay. Similarly, if the call to presentViewController:animated:completion: is made from within a dispatch_async block on the main thread, there is no delay.\r\n\r\nI have provided an example Xcode project which demos the problem. In the example, the delay is not huge, but the same situation in a more complex app can cause a delay of several seconds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached example project (in TableViewDelayBug.zip) in Xcode and run the app.\r\n\r\nThe segmented control in the master view lets you choose between 3 ways of showing the detail view controller:\r\n1. Push - calls pushViewController:animated:, and is instant.\r\n2. Present - calls presentViewController:animated:completion: and has a noticeable delay.\r\n3. Pres Async - calls presentViewController:animated:completion: from within a dispatch_async block on the main thread and is also instant.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is all in MasterViewController.m in the implementation of tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath: at line 51.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe detail view controller should appear instantly, regardless of whether it is pushed onto the navigation stack or presented modally. It should not be necessary to present modally from within a dispatch_async block in order to achieve an instant presentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the detail view controller is presented modally (without the workaround of a dispatch_async block) there is a noticeable delay before it appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (simulator or device)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 (simulator or device)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableViewDelayBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nDropbox link to attachment: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1020204/TableViewDelayBug.zip"
