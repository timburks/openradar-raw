    description: "Summary:\r\nIf 2 or more reminders have been configured for the same day, hour and minute, they will be presented in such a manner that only one of the reminders is interactable with the user. This could lead to a situation where the contract \"to be reminded at a certain time\" is not functionally met, potentially causing embarrassment or danger to a user who has come to rely upon iOS to help organize their life.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo reproduce the problem, create two or more reminders for a specific time and wait for that time to arrive. For example, if the time is currently 9:13:\r\n\r\n1. Activate Siri and say \"Remind me at 9:14 to save the universe\", creating a reminder.\r\n2. Activate Siri and say \"Remind me at 9:14 to water the plants\", creating a reminder.\r\n3. Activate Siri and say \"Remind me at 9:14 to watch TV\", creating a reminder.\r\n4. Wait until 9:14.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll three time-sensitive reminders should be presented modally, in succession.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll three time-sensitive reminders appear to be presented in rapid succesion, force-dismissing the previous one before it can be read or interacted with. The result is an ugly flicker that also hides data that wold normally require the user's interaction in order to dismiss."
