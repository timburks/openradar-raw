        Summary:
        For the best UX every APP should support the "continous-swipe-and-delete" gesture which Mail got in iOS 8.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. open Mail on iOS8
        2. feel lucky to have at least one unread email
        3. feel bad it's spam
        4. swipe-and-delete an email entry within the new Mail APP
        5. switch to Messages
        6. feel lucky for a new message
        7. feel bad about a complete stranger contacting you
        8. try swipe-and-delete and got stock half the way along
        9. touch delete button
        10. feel better

        Expected Results:
        8. swipe-and-delete the entry from within Message
        -> feel like a pro

        Actual Results:
        -> UX inconsistency/confusion

        Regression:
        (almost?) all APPs except Mail (obviously) suffer from the missing API/behaviour
