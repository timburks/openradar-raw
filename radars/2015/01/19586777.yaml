    description: The only place where find this event documented in the Safari Developer Library is the document „Safari Extensions Development Guide“. And that description leaves more questions that answers. Every subresource? Also for XHR-requests? Form requests? Dynamically included script tags? Video sources? While the Image prefetcher works? I don't know.
