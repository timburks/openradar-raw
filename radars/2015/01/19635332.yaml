    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen putting a WKInterfaceImage inside of a WKInterfaceGroup in a storyboard, one can set the image height to Relative to Container and the group height to Size to Fit Content. This way, you can load an image from the network, resize the group at runtime to fit the image (setting a max height of 123pt, for instance, if the image is too big), and have everything work correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, the way that this is represented in storyboard is confusing. It works at runtime, but visually, the image ends up being enormous, taking up the majority of the Watch face.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a group in a storyboard\r\n2. Set the group's width to Relative to Container and the height to Size to Fit Content\r\n3. Put an image inside the group\r\n4. Set the image's width and height to Relative to Container\r\n5. The image takes up the majority of the Watch face\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince there's no content, the size of the group and image should be very small until an image is actually added and the group dynamically resized at runtime with setHeight and setWidth.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image in the storyboard appears to be huge, even though everything works at runtime.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 4, OS X 10.10.1"
