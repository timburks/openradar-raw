    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter plugging a rMBP into a thunderbolt display, the magic mouse never connects.  The mouse has brand new batteries.  Restarting bluetooth does not fix the problem.  Logging in and out does not fix the problem.  Only rebooting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  rMBP 15\" logged to an account in sleep mode over night.\r\n2.  Plug into Thunderbolt Display in the morning. Keep in clamshell mode.\r\n3.  Log in when display wakes up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMouse works.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMouse doesn't work.  The green LED light blinks like it is in search mode.  The bluetooth icon in the menu bar never shows the three dots indicating it is connected.  Clicking and sliding the mouse around does nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)"
