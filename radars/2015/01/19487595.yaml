    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8, setting the modalInPopover property dynamically while the view controller is presented does not have any effect on the view controller.  This behavior occurs when using both UIPopoverPresentationController and the \"soft\" depreciated UIPopoverController.  Prior to iOS 8, the property would behave as intended regardless of whether the view controller is presented.\r\n\r\nAlthough if you set modalInPopover to YES prior to presentation, the view controller will be modal after presentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Present a view controller using the UIPopoverPresentationController APIs or depreciated UIPopoverController.\r\n2. The presented view controller should contain a button, which it's action should toggle the value of modalInPopover.\r\n3. Select the button to set modalInPopover = YES.\r\n4. Tap outside of the presented view controller (the dimming view)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view controller should be modal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view controller does not become modal.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPad, iPad Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
