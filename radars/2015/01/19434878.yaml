    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari for iOS 8.1, applying `display: block;` to temporal <input>s, (i.e. <input>s of type=\"date\" , type=\"time\" , type=\"datetime-local\" , or type=\"month\") causes the <input>'s value text to become vertically top-aligned instead of vertically centered.\r\nThis does not match the behavior of other browsers (specifically: OS X Firefox, OS X Chrome, and OS X Safari).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsbin.com/janaz/4 in iOS Safari\r\n2. Observe that the 1st <input> in each section, which has a `display: block;` CSS style applied to it,\r\n     has its text aligned to the top of the <input>'s box.\r\n     Compare this to the 2nd <input> in each section,\r\n     which has its default `display` left at its default value,\r\n     and which has its text vertically centered within the <input>'s box.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the <input>s in the example should have their text vertically centered. See 2nd attached screenshot (taken in Chrome) that shows the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll the <input>s in the example should have their text vertically top-aligned.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFirefox and OS X Safari behave the same as Chrome.\r\n\r\nWebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139848\r\n\r\nOriginal Bootstrap bug reports:\r\n* https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11266\r\n* https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/13098\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'safaribug.png' and 'correct_chrome.png' were successfully uploaded."
