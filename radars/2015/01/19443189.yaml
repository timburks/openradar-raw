        Summary:
        Upon upgrade from 10.9.x(various versions) or a clean imaging of 10.10.1, machines that are bound to AD become frozen during startup or post FV2 EFI unlock. A progress bar gets 1/3rd or as much as a 1/2 way, then stops. Logs in verbose mode showed networking related issues, but no network setups seem to make a difference.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - update or install or image 10.10.1
        - bind machine to AD(not a .local domain, placed in a custom OU/container three levels deep of the single-domain forest, but otherwise no extensive connector modifications are used)
        - start machine as normal, or unlock FV2

        Expected Results:
        Machine boots and allows mouse control, usable OS

        Actual Results:
        Locked at ~1/3rd to 1/2, no mouse or keyboard response, caps lock light is active but otherwise DOA

        Regression:
        noticed on 10.10 as well, was unsure it was solely related to domain binding

        Notes:
        Clearing /private/var/db/BootCache* and /Library/Caches/com.apple* has been attempted with varying degrees of success. Asking enterprise support for backup.
