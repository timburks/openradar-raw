    description: "Summary:\nThere is a NSLayoutConstraint conflict while using a UIDocumentMenuViewController and selecting a UIDocumentPickerViewController.\n\nUnable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.\n\tProbably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints) \n(\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb43978df90 H:[UIView:0x7fb439786140(304)]>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb4396bad40 _UIAlertControllerView:0x7fb439785c40.width == UIView:0x7fb439785b00.width>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb4396c58f0 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Width' H:[UIView:0x7fb439785b00(142)]>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb43978c4b0 _UIAlertControllerView:0x7fb439785c40.width >= UIView:0x7fb439786140.width>\"\n)\n\nWill attempt to recover by breaking constraint \n<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb43978df90 H:[UIView:0x7fb439786140(304)]>\n\nMake a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.\nThe methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKit/UIView.h> may also be helpful.\n\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nInstantiate and present a UIDocumentMenuViewController\nSelect the iCloud document provider\n\nExpected Results:\n\n\nActual Results:\nThe log appears on the debugger, however the popover content seams to show correctly\n\nRegression:\n\nNotes:\nI managed to fix the log by applying setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints to NO to the document menu view.\nThe file attached contains the printed view hirarchy in the context when the error occurs"
