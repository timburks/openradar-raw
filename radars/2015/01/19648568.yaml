        Summary:
        Every time I create a target, I have a series of manual steps I have to do to clean up the turds that Xcode creates. STOP CREATING TEST TARGETS BY DEFAULT! At the very least, make it a check box. Itâ€™s so frustrating to create something and a whole set of other crap comes along of the ride. If I want a test target, I know how to create it. Please stop.
