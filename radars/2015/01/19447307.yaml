    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA provisioning profile created manually via the developer portal or automatically with Xcode can expire before the certificate used to create it.\r\n\r\nFor example, this provisioning has expired:\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/Expired_Provisioning.png\r\n\r\nBut the certificate used to create it has not:\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/Valid_Certificate.png\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a certificate using the developer portal.\r\n2. Create a provisioning profile using the developer portal.\r\n3. Wait a year.\r\n\r\n(The files downloaded from the portal are attached to this bug report.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe certificate should expire at the same time as (or before the) provisioning profile.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe provisioning profile expires before the certificate. This breaks both internal and external builds, causing general havoc.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe portal is as confused as this developer: the status for the expired provisioning is both Active and Expired.\r\n\r\nEven a fastidious developer will get tripped up by this if they add the certificate expiration date to their calendar. Many do this because we not only deal with certificates for apps, but also for web sites where SSL and push notification services are deployed.\r\n\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAttached are two files:\r\n\r\nIconfactory_Distribution.cer which expires on 1/13/2015 at 8:05:10 AM PST\r\nIconfactory_App_Store_Distribution.mobileprovision which expires on 1/12/2015 at 12:04 PST\r\n\r\nWant to bet someone is using local time and someone else is using GMT?"
