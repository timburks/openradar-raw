        Summary:
        Per Winnie’s notes https://twitter.com/thatswinnie/status/560259247498600448 asking Siri who the phone belongs to causes it to show the full contact card selected as the owner. So does telling Siri never to show people my contact card.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Tell Siri: “Never show people my contact card.”


        Expected Results:
        I expected it wouldn’t work, since Siri doesn’t usually know that sort of interaction.


        Actual Results:
        Siri displayed my full contact card.


        Regression:
        N/A
