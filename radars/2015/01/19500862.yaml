    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring the setup of a new device, a screen is displayed asking if the user wants to enable or disable Location Services. For a variety of reasons, I select “Disable Location Services”. When I finish setting up the device, and head into Settings > General > Date & Time - I can see that iOS has chosen to enable the automatic setting of time zones. The problem—as confirmed by the note on the bottom—is that “Setting the time zone automatically requires turning on Location Services”. Where the time zone is displayed, it shows a Spinner, which is not an ideal experience. If I turn off “Set Automatically” and toggle it back on, I am not prompted to enable Location Services.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen is if Location Services is disabled, “Set Automatically” for time zones should be also be disabled. In the event that a user wants to turn it on, they should be prompted to toggle on Location Services.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Reset an iPad, or break out a new one. \r\n2. Walkthrough on-boarding, until you reach Location Services.\r\n3. At Location Services, Disable Location Services.\r\n4. Finish on-boarding. \r\n5. Go to Settings > General > Date & Time.\r\n6. Note that \"Set Automatically\" is ON and spinner is visible in Timezone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee Steps 1 - 5.\r\n6. \"Set Automatically\" should be OFF. Timezone defaults to \"Cupertino\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Set Automatically\" is ON and spinner is visible in Timezone."
