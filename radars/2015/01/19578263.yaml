    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Messages is the active window, clicking causes the window to “jump” to where the user clicked. This includes clicking somewhere inside the Messages window itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Make sure the Messages window is active.\r\n2.  Interact with another window, while keeping Messages the active window (unsure if this is required to reproduce, but I can consistently reproduce when, for example, scrolling a few times within Tweetbot).\r\n3.  Click somewhere.\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\nThe item clicked on should gain focus.\r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\n(Occasionally) The item clicked gains focus, but the Messages window moves where the user clicked."
