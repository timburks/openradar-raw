    description: "Summary:\r\nWe render a HTML on a UIWebView. While the rendering is going on, the user plugs in the device to the mac and the \"Trust this computer\" alert shows up. This moves the app to the background and on dismissing the alert, while the app comes to the foreground, it crashes. \r\n\r\nHowever, this issue is very infrequent. I have attached both the stack trace and the thread on which the app crashed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a UIWebview in the application.\r\n2. Load a HTML on the webview.\r\n3. While the webview is rendering, connect the device to the mac and let the \"Trust your computer\" alert show up.\r\n4. On dismissing the alert, the app crashes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app does not crash when the \"Trust your computer\" alert is dismissed when the UIWebview is still rendering.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashed when the \"Trust your computer\" alert is dismissed when the UIWebview is still rendering.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone OS Version 8.1 (Build 12B411)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus"
