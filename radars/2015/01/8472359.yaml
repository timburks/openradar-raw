    description: "Summary:\r\n/usr/bin/zip produces files which /usr/bin/unzip cannot read if the input file is stdin.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a Terminal window in any convenient directory. Type the following commands:\r\n\r\necho hello | zip test.zip -\r\nunzip test.zip\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe unzip command would output\r\n    Archive: test.zip\r\n     extracting -\r\nand a file \"-\" would appear containing the contents \"hello\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo file is generated. The following error message is output:\r\n\r\nArchive:  test.zip\r\nwarning [test.zip]:  76 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile\r\n  (attempting to process anyway)\r\nerror [test.zip]:  reported length of central directory is\r\n  -76 bytes too long (Atari STZip zipfile?  J.H.Holm ZIPSPLIT 1.1\r\n  zipfile?).  Compensating...\r\n   skipping: -                       need PK compat. v4.5 (can do v2.1)\r\n\r\nnote:  didn't find end-of-central-dir signature at end of central dir.\r\n  (please check that you have transferred or created the zipfile in the\r\n  appropriate BINARY mode and that you have compiled UnZip properly)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis affects 10.6.2 and 10.6.4 Intel, and does not affect 10.5.8 PPC.\r\n(Sorry, I'm unable to test 10.5.x Intel)\r\n\r\nzip on Debian Linux (ostensibly the same version) is not affected."
