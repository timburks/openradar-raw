    description: "Summary:\r\nTests should verify the public behavior of a component. In Swift a componentâ€™s internal methods are public from within the module they belong too. In order to test this internal public behavior, a method is required to make tests part of that module.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an internal class or method\r\n2. Attempt to use that class or method from the unit test target\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe unit test should have access to the class / method\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe unit test does not have access"
