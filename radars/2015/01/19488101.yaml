    description: "One client’s sales team uses our app to show product videos on an external monitor, frequently switching back and forth from mirroring the webpage to the native full-screen video control.\r\n\r\nIn recent versions of the iOS, they are experiencing an issue where the iPad appears to quit mirroring, only showing a black background on the attached monitor.  In the Control Center, the device still shows as connected to AirPlay and mirroring is on.\r\n\r\nI was able to replicate this in mobile Safari on the same devices.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Mirror device to external screen using either Airplay to Apple TV or wired AV Adapter.\r\n2) Open mobile Safari and navigate to http://www.kioskproapp.com/tests/video-mirroring/index.html \r\n3) Tap screen to view video.\r\n4) On video page, tap the full-screen icon in the lower right corner.\r\n5) Wait for the video to start to AirPlay to the device.\r\n6) Tap ‘Done’ to exit full-screen mode.\r\n7) Tap back button.\r\n8) Check to see if device is now mirroring.  If yes, repeat steps 2-8.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExternal screen shifts between full-screen video and mirroring when expected. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn my testing, mirroring generally fails after this sequence is repeated 10-20 times.   \r\n\r\nAfter mirroring fails in this way, you can exit mobile Safari to the home screen and mirroring is not re-established, but AirPlay is marked as connected and mirroring is on.  Both AirPlay and Mirroring can be toggled on and off without any visible effect on the connected monitor.\r\n\r\nRebooting the device and reconnecting AirPlay resolves the issue (which can then be replicated again through the above steps).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad Air 2, iOS 8.1.2\r\niPad 2, iOS 8.1.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nable to replicate with both Apple TV (A1427, software 7.0.2 (6915)) and Digital AV Adapter (A1422)"
