    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you select a text in Safari or anywhere else and then right-click and select the \"Look up\" popup menu the Dictionary will be displayed. Then if you select a work inside the dictionary and then right-click again and select \"Look up\" again the the dictionary popup closes and the selected work remain floating on screen (see attachments).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open Safari on any web page, e.g.: http://www.viggiosoft.com/blog/blog/2014/08/05/social-login-with-cocoa-and-cocoa-touch/\r\n2. select any english word and right click on it, then select the \"Look up <word>\" menu: the dictionary with opened to the selected work will popup (see \"bug1.png\" attachment)\r\n3. then from the dictionary popup select another word, right-click and select \"Look up <new word>\" again\r\n4. the dictionary will close and the new word will be displayed only highlighted and floating on the screen (see \"bug2.png\" attachment)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect in step (4) of the description above a new lookup dictionary to open or, at least, the same lookup popup to replace its content with the dictionary result of the new search\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA weird effect instead is displayed, where the popup is closed and the select work remains highlighted and floating in the middle of the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1"
