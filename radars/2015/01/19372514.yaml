    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 8 there has been an \"EU Internet\" toggle underneath the Data Roaming toggle in the Settings -> Cellular menu (probably only for EU subscribers). The only explanation for this toggle is in the subtext underneath \"[...] EU Internet service only applies to Internet and personal hotspot data traffic\". There is no further explanation about this \"EU Internet service\".\r\n\r\nMy original thought was that the toggle would limit Data Roaming services only to EU member states. I tried it, and found that even though the \"3G\" (or other cellular data technology indication) icon remained visible on the phone, we were effectively disconnected from the internet. The fact that \"3G\" remains visible can be deceptive, and lead to think that cellular data is functioning properly.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some online research, I found out that the 'bug' is in fact a feature to enable LBO (Local Breakout). This changes the APN to 'euinternet' and signals the carrier that you have singed up to a different data roaming provider (LBO). This LBO scheme is fairly new, and the EU public seems to ignore all about it. For the moment, the only LBO provider is \"Cheap Data\", available to EU subscribers roaming in Lithuania. (https://www.cheapdata.com/#/home)\r\n\r\nThere seems to be misinformation and confusion circulating on websites & forums. Here are some websites:\r\n- Cult Of Mac reports \"[...] gives users the ability to active Internet connectivity when they visit countries inside the European Union, while in other parts of the world in will remain inactive\" which is completely false (http://www.cultofmac.com/288360/europeans-new-roaming-options/)\r\n- The same happens on iDownloadBlog (http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/07/28/ios-8-beta-4-eu-internet/)\r\n- And on Redmond Pie (http://www.redmondpie.com/ios-8-beta-4-adds-new-eu-internet-switch-for-european-users-heres-what-it-does/)\r\n\r\nAnd here are some confused users:\r\n- StackExchange (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148188/what-does-the-eu-internet-switch-do-on-my-iphone-5s)\r\n- Apple Support Communities (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6541651)\r\n- Reddit /r/iPhone (http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/2bj7ws/what_exactly_is_eu_internet_should_i_turn_it_on/)\r\n\r\nI think the confusion comes from the name & explanation of the function. Changing the name to \"EU Local Breakout\", explaining the APN change underneath and prompting a warning when toggling \"EU Local Breakout will only provide internet connectivity if you've signed up with an LBO\" would certainly make for less accidental disconnections.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be in another EU member state\r\n2. Have data roaming enabled and working\r\n3. Unlock iPhone\r\n4. Go to Settings -> Cellular\r\n5. Toggle EU Internet\r\n6. Attempt to load a web page in Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari web page loads successfully, since the toggle limits roaming only to EU member states.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari can't load the page, since the toggle changes the APN to 'euinternet', and the user hasn't signed up for any LBO (Local Breakout)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4s 16GB on BASE (Belgium)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0178.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
