        Summary:
        If you have a single screen with several spaces, you can assign an application's windows to a particular space by clicking its dock icon and choosing one of the "Assign to" options from the "Options" submenu.

        If you have multiple screens attached to your Mac, you can set it up to have a separate space for each screen (giving you 2 spaces).

        Therefore, I would expect to be able to click an application's dock icon and assign it to a particular screen.

        However, the menu item is not visible.

        To make the menu item visible, I have to create a second space at least on one of the two screens, even if I do not want more than one space per screen.

        Please fix this mechanism so I can assign an application's windows to a particular screen when "Displays have separate Spaces" is active.

        Thanks!

        PS - Or even better, just remember what screen an application was last opened on and re-open it on there, instead of opening them on some random screen.
