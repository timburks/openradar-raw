    description: "Summary:\r\nSome AAC audio streams are unlistenable.\r\n\r\nThe amount of audio degradation varies: sometimes it's just a \"ringing\" at high frequencies, other times it's a painful screeching noise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tune into one of the following URLs using iTunes 12.0.1.26\r\n\r\nhttp://stream-dc1.radioparadise.com/aac-128\r\nhttp://stream-uk1.radioparadise.com/aac-128\r\nhttp://stream-ru1.radioparadise.com:9000/aac-128\r\n\r\n2. Listen\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe audio should play without any degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEventually, you'll want to rip your ears out.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample:\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/128k.m4a\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe audio was reproduced using a Nuforce ÂµDAC connected to the USB port on the back of an Apple Thunderbolt Display. It was recorded using the Voice Memos app on my iPhone 6. A .spx file is attached.\r\n\r\nThe same streams play without any problems on my Squeezebox 2 and Squeezebox Boom. They also played fine in Mavericks with iTunes 11.\r\n\r\nA 64K stream from the same station plays correctly:\r\n\r\nhttp://stream-tx1.radioparadise.com/aac-64\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/64k.m4a"
