        Summary:
        It would be helpful to have an URL scheme in order to open the system camera APP.

        Every iOS version introduces new exciting features we developers have no access to (i.a. generate *and* save burst photos into the photo library) which only the built in APP can provide. At least redirect the user would alleviate the missing API.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        -

        Expected Results:
        Something like
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:UIApplicationOpenCameraURLString]];
        would be awesome.

        Actual Results:
        -

        Regression:
        -
