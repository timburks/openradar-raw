While service request is still being processed, app was sent to background. \r\n2. After several hours, user launched the app. Since the requests are still being processed prior to going background, those calls are being sent from the app and these calls received the timeout error. \r\n3. Then the App Crashed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEven after the requests which are waiting in the background are processed when the app becomes active, segmentation violation shouldn't happen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRequests being processed when the app goes to background when retried if the app becomes active causes segmentation violation in the DNSServiceProcessResult(as per stack trace)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone6,1"
