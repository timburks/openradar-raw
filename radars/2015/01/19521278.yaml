        Summary:

        The Icon Services cache can easily get corrupted. Iâ€™ve seen it happen during a Yosemite install, a Yosemite upgrade and when installing apps with icons updated using the new Yosemite style.

        When this happens, the only recourse is to use the following Terminal commands:

        $ sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \;

        $ sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \;

        $ sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store

        Followed by restarting your Mac.

        Notes:

        Considering that this bug can easily be encountered by end users, there also needs to be a more user friendly way to clear this cache. Terminal commands scare the hell out of most normal folks.
