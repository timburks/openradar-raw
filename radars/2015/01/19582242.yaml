    description: "Description:\r\nChanging the text color on an WKInterfaceLabel outside of the awakeWithContext: method has stopped working as of WatchKit 8.2 beta 4. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a WatchKit project\r\n2. Add an Interface Controller scene to the watch app’s storyboard\r\n3. Create a custom WKInterfaceController subclass called MYInterfaceController and set its class name in the Class field in the identity inspector for the above scene\r\n4. Add a WKInterfaceLabel to the scene\r\n5. Control+drag from the new label to the MYInterfaceController class in the assistant editor\r\n6. Name the new outlet connection “myLabel\"\r\n7. Set the text color on the new label to blue in the attributes inspector\r\n8. Add an awakeWithContext: override to MYInterfaceController, and include the following line of code:\r\n    [self.myLabel setTextColor:[UIColor yellowColor]];\r\n9. Add a context menu to MYInterfaceController in the storyboard, configure one menu item to call a new IBAction method\r\n10. In the IBAction method add the following line of code:\r\n    [self.myLabel setTextColor:[UIColor redColor]];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the scene loads on the Apple Watch simulator, the label should show text in yellow. When the context menu button is tapped, the label color should change to red.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label color is yellow, even after tapping the menu button which should change it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: (hardware)\r\niMac 27-inch, Late 2012\r\n\r\nVersion & Build:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 4 (6C107a)\r\niOS Simulator 8.2 (553.8)\r\nOS X 10.10.2 seed 5 (14C106a)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot an issue in Xcode 6.2 beta 3 (6C101) / iOS Simulator 8.2 (553.8). The label color changes correctly."
