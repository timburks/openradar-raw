    description: "When creating an instance of NSURLSessionDownloadTask with a hostname that doesn't resolve, no NSURLSession delegate methods will get called (most notably, URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError will never get called). In most situations, this means that the app cannot know when the request did or did not complete without some hacky workarounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an NSURLSession with a defined delegate, and define URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError on this delegate.\r\n2. Create a NSURLSessionDownloadTask with a URL that doesn't resolve. I.e.,\r\n\r\nNSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://testing1234442322.com\"];\r\nNSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];\r\nNSURLSessionDownloadTask *task = [mySession downloadTaskWithURL:url];\r\n[task resume]\r\n\r\n3. Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nURLSession:task:didCompleteWithError will get called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nURLSession:task:didCompleteWithError never gets called, nor do any of the other delegate methods."
