        Summary:
        Tests should verify the public behavior of a component. In Swift a componentâ€™s internal methods are public from within the module they belong too. In order to test this internal public behavior, a method is required to make tests part of that module.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an internal class or method
        2. Attempt to use that class or method from the unit test target

        Expected Results:
        The unit test should have access to the class / method

        Actual Results:
        The unit test does not have access
