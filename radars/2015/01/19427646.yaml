    description: Xcode provides the nifty 'Behaviors' feature, accessible from both Preferences as well as the Xcode menu. However, there doesn't seem to be a way to import or export Behaviors, so that they can be moved to an Xcode installation on another Mac. A tool to allow Behaviors to be imported or exported would be very convenient for developers who work on multiple machines, or whose machines are upgraded relatively frequently.
