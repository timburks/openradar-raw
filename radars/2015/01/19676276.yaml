        Summary:
        The More info… button inside of the attached screenshot leads to http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572, which is, weirdly, a blank page.

        Steps to reproduce:
        1. Try to launch an app that requires Java (like JDownloader http://jdownloader.org, for instance) without having it installed.
        2. The window attached as a screenshot opens. The More info… button leads to a white page.
