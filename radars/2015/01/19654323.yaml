        Summary:
        Data Detectors will spot URLs without a preceding http:// or https:// if the TLD is .com, .edu, or .org (or other presumably common TLDs, I did not try them all). However, it doesnâ€™t recognize .io, for instance.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Type a URL into Messages or other app that uses Cocoa text frameworks

        Expected Results:
        The URL is recognized and converted into a clickable link.

        Actual Results:
        The text is not converted into a clickable link.

        Regression:
        Unknown, presumably all versions of OS X.

        Notes:
        Image is attached showing similar URLs, where one is recognized and the other is not.
