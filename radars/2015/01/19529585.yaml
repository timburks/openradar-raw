    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `xed` command's `--line` argument allows you to open a file in Xcode at a specified line number. Technically it works, but is extremely slow (often, several seconds!) and the viewport is not scrolled so that the selected line would be visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a file in Xcode and scroll the viewport so that line 2 is NOT visible.\r\n2. In Terminal.app, run \"xed --line 2 /path/to/the/file\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• Xcode opens the file\r\n• Xcode sets the insertion point to line 2\r\n• Xcode scrolls the viewport so that the insertion point is visible\r\n• All of the above happens _quickly_ (i.e. within one second)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• Xcode opens the file (as expected)\r\n• Xcode sets the insertion point to line 2 (as expected)\r\n• Xcode DOES NOT scroll the viewport so that the insertion point would be visible\r\n• Xcode opens the file quickly (as expected), but it can take several seconds for the insertion point to move to the specified line."
