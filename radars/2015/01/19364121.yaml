        Summary:
        There is no way to access the NSViewController responsible for the root view of a window from the window’s NSWindowController.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the API docs
        2. Discover there is no way to access the view controller

        Expected Results:
        I expected to find a method analogous to rootViewController on UIWindow in UIKit.

        Actual Results:
        No way to do it.

        Notes:
        This can be worked around by calling self.view.window!.windowController()! in the NSViewController’s viewWillAppear (can’t use viewDidLoad, see rdar://18565021) and setting a property on the window controller. But this is a deeply unsatisfying hack and we shouldn’t have to bend over backwards to do this.
