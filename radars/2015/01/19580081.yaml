    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to easily determine which accessibility element is currently focused by VoiceOver.  While you can traverse the entire view hierarchy and test accessibilityElementIsFocused, the app won't know when to do this logic because it doesn't know when focus changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver should do two things to help identify the currently focused element:\r\n\r\n1. Post a notification when focus changes to a new element (i.e., UIAccessibilityFocusChangedNotification with the new id<UIAccessibility> instance in the userInfo dictionary)\r\n2. Provide a global function that returns a pointer to the currently focused element or add it as a property to UIWindow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no API to determine the currently focused element across an entire view hierarchy or determine when that focus changes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2 (12B440)"
