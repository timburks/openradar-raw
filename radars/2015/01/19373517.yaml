    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using NSWorkspace openURL: or LSOpenURLsWithRole() on Yosemite, no more than 6-7 files or folders can be opened at once. Before 10.10, this was never an issue.\r\n\r\nFor example, the attached project atttempts to open 10 folders (as windows in the Finder). On 10.9, this works, on 10.10 only about 6 open, for the rest there's even an error msg when using openURL: (\"You can't open the application \"Finder\" because it is not responding\").\r\n\r\nLooks like a regression bug to me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall NSWorkspace openURL: on more than 7 different folder URLs. Test on 10.10 and 10.9 systems.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll folders should open as windows in the Finder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly up to 6 or 7 open on 10.10, whereas they all open fine on 10.9 and earlier systems.\r\n\r\nAttachment can be downloaded here:\r\n\r\nhttp://files.tempel.org/Various/LSOpenURLsWithRole-Test.zip"
