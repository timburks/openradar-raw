    description: "Summary:\r\nAdding a hidden window on iOS is a common way to add HUD overlay elements or other small features - iOS does this as well with it's text effects window. In iOS 8 however, a hidden window now affects rotation. As soon as we call addWindowForHUD the view rotates, which is should not. For some reason the rootViewController of the hidden view is consulted instead of the keyWindow's rootViewController. This is a regression from iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached WindowRotationIssue example. Works on both iOS 7 and 8. Only iOS 8 exhibits the bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly the keyWindow should be consulted for rotation callbacks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe rootViewController in our hidden window is called for rotation callbacks.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a regression from iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLooking at -[UIWindow setRootViewController:] there's a new UIApplicationLinkedOnOrAfter check for iOS 8 that calls tryBecomeRootViewControllerInWindow: if running iOS 8.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s my full debug log for this issue:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/steipete/8df39fea0d39680a7a6b"
