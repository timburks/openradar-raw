    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen displaying RTF files, the navigation bar at the top of the QuickLook view obscures the top of the RTF content. For other files, like Excel or Word files, the content is shifted down so that it is not obscured by the nav bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an RTF file in TextEdit on OS X.\r\n2. Email it to yourself as an attachment.\r\n3. Open the email in Mail.app on iOS 8.1.\r\n4. The top of the file is hidden beneath the navbar.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, create an iOS app that uses QLPreviewController and attempt to display the RTF file from step 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the navigation bar is present, the RTF content is shifted downwards on the screen so that it is not hidden beneath the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the navigation bar is present, the RTF content is displayed beneath the navigation bar so that the content is unreadable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 simulator or 8.1.2 device (possibly any iOS 8.x)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS Simulator Screen Shot 2015-01-22, 15.07.04.png' was successfully uploaded."
