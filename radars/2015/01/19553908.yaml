    description: Updating the Interface Controller title using the setTitle method tends to fail while the controller is being transitioned to, either via a modal dismissal or using the becomeCurrentPage API. The workaround is to hold the new title in a property and set it after willActivate is called…which does work. However, it seems like updating the title should be able to be performed anywhere and WatchKit should just re-draw the title whenever it’s ready to do so.
