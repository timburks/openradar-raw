        Summary:
        The thread safety notes for NSNumberFormatter refer to NSDateFormatter instead:

        “THREAD SAFETY

        On iOS 7 and later NSDateFormatter is thread safe.

        On OS X v10.9 and later NSDateFormatter is thread safe so long as you are using the modern behavior in a 64-bit app.

        On earlier versions of the operating system, or when using the legacy formatter behavior or running in 32-bit on OS X, NSDateFormatter is not thread safe and you therefore must not mutate a date formatter simultaneously from multiple threads.”


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Go and look at the NSNumberFormatter docs, specifically the thread safety section.


        Expected Results:
        I expected to read about NSNumberFormatter’s thread safety.


        Actual Results:
        I actually read about NSDateFormatter’s thread safety. It’s not 100% clear whether I can assume that s/Date/Number/ will be accurate, either, so as it stands I’ve no idea what the thread safety of NSNumberFormatter is.
