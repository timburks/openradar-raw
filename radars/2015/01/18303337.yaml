    description: "Summary:\r\nI am developing apps since iOS 4 and I can't believe its not fixed yet. Each week I am bumped into developers with the same problem.\r\nMy app iSachar which released in 2011 only 20/77 mails were not empty mails - thats 75% spam.\r\nMy app Parties for WWDC which released this year before the WWDC only 8/41 mails were not empty mails - thats 80% spam.\r\nThe same thin with other apps and developers.\r\n\r\nI suspect that its easier for users to press \"Send\" (which is bold) and just close the email and not press the \"Cancel\" and \"Delete Draft\".\r\n\r\nThis is easy to fix by checking if user entered some text and only then enabling the \"Send\", some delegation maybe needed if the developer wants people just press the send because the text is programmable.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a small problem but it drives me crazy for 4 years and counting.\r\n\r\nI am willing to buy a plane ticket and come and solve it!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownloading Parties for WWDC app from the app store, press the + and send me some empty mails.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI am getting an empty mail :(\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmpty mails with \"Sent from my iPhone\" in Chinese and crazy other languages.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS2-iOS8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niDevices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
