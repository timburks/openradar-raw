    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, it's perfectly simple to set a custom background color on a particular view. However, if you want to use this color on multiple views throughout your storyboard and then want to change the color, you have to change it in a bunch of different places. This leads people to stray away from storyboards, instead setting colors via code where they can be reused.\r\n\r\nStoryboards should allow us to create new colors with variable names. That way, we can reuse a variable all over the place and only change the value of the variable once, just like if we were setting the color in code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a storyboard\r\n2. Open the Inspector\r\n3. Define a custom color\r\n4. Setting view's color properties to the custom color all over the place\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way for reusing custom colors in storyboards.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way of reusing custom colors in storyboards, so we have to use views instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
