    description: "Summary:\r\nI work in downtown Detroit, and the parking situation downtown is very constrained. As a result, I have to park about a half mile from my office. I canâ€™t use Siri to get directions to work to see how long my commute will be in current traffic conditions; instead, I have to create a bookmark for the parking structure and navigate to that instead.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if I could specify an address or map pin as where I park for work, then if I ask Siri for directions to work, it would direct me to park there, then walk to the office. The walking directions would also be nice once the Apple Watch is out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure your work address in your Contacts app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way to configure a work parking address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no work parking address."
