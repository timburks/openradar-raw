    description: "In C++ in Xcode, when overriding a virtual method and inlining the definition of that method, automatic indentation fails to work properly in the rest of the file if that class has multiple inheritance. If I type code like this:\r\n\r\nclass Test : public Parent1, public Parent2\r\n{\r\n   void foo() override { print(\"foo\"); }\r\n\r\nEverywhere after that line in the file, the indentation will be screwed up. After pressing enter on that line, instead of being indented one tab in like it should, the cursor will be at the start of the line. If I do indent, then define another method and press enter again, that line will have its indentation removed. It makes it impossible to work within the file and maintain a proper coding standard without constantly re-indenting after every edit.\r\n\r\nCuriously, this seems to only be a problem in .h files, and not in .cpp files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode\r\n2. Create a new project\r\n3. Create a new Header file\r\n4. Type the following:\r\n\r\nclass Test : public Parent1, public Parent2\r\n{\r\n   void foo() override { print(\"foo\"); }\r\n\r\n5. Press \"enter\" after that final line and notice that the cursor does not follow the proper indentation.\r\n6. Attempt to write more code and notice how the indentation behavior insists on removing all indentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIndentation should behave the way it does after writing the same code, with \"override\" removed:\r\nclass Test : public Parent1, public Parent2\r\n{\r\n   void foo() { print(\"foo\"); }\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe indentation resets to the beginning of the line for every line after the override keyword.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\nOS X 10.9.5 (13F34)"
