    description: "I was looking for a Safari equivalent of EFFs HTTPS Anywhere. The reason this doesn't exist seems to be that Firefox, Chrome, Opera can change beginning HTTP requests into the web. All of them. Equivalent  Safari Extensions are thrown back to not so great documented beforenavigate and beforeload DOM Events. The latter seems to be deactivated for some subressources of the document, e.g. frames, if I understand the Webkit Trac correctly.\r\n\r\nEncryption everywhere seems to be a needed future for the web, as so found in decisions by the IETF and the W3C's TAG. HTTPS Anywhere or similar extensions give users a slightly better web until this future may come."
