    description: "Summary:\r\nThe inputItems property for NSExtensionContext creates an NSArray of NSExtensionItems. In most instances, the detail view for an app on the iOS App Store app provides a share sheet that makes two NSExtensionItems available: 1) an NSString with the title of the App; and 2) an NSURL with a short app store link to the app. If, however, the user taps a tableView cell under the Updates tab of the iOS App Store app to view the detail page for the app displayed in that cell, the the share sheet only returns one NSExtensionItem -- the title of the app in the form of an NSString.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iOS App Store app.\r\n2. Open any detail page for an app from the features tab.\r\n3. Tap the share button\r\n4. Chose the \"Copy\" Action Extension\r\n5. Paste the results into any text editor and you get the title and short link for the app\r\n6. same steps as above but from the Updates tab of the iOS App Store app and the pasted results are the title of the app only\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that the Copy action extension or any other extension will have the title and link to an app available to it from the share sheet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, from the Update tab of the App Store app, only the title of the app is available to extensions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2"
