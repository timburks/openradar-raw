    description: Receiving an OpenDocument AppleEvent in my Carbon app for files from the Finder I no longer get the whole list in one event, but could receive two or more separate events. This is not consistent with previous OS versions where the entire list was given in one event, and the change has broken my app. EG, a droplet app only sends 3 or 4 items of 40 items dragged to it from Finder.
