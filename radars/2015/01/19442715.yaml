    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen reading text on a web page in Safari, the text to speech pronounces “bullet” (or “black square”) twice after each new line, when reading text set as bulleted list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open attached ul.html test file in Safari\r\n2) Select all text\r\n3) Press Alt+Esc to activate Text to Speech\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nParagraphs read in continuous manner, with each bullet pronounced once at most\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n“Bullet” or “Black square”, depending on the list formatting style, i pronounce twice at the end of each line and once around structural elements in text like abbreviations <abbr> or emphasis <em>.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari Version 8.0.2 (10600.2.5)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n‘ul.html’:\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<body>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><abbr>OS</abbr> X is degrading into a base for an entertainment platform.
