    description: "On iPhone 6+ (iOS 8.1), when you open page in landscape orientation and page has element with properties \"position: fixed; bottom: 0; right: 0\" element is rendered in Safari's address bar instead in html area of page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start iPhone 6+ simulator (iOS8.1)\r\n2. Rotate it to landscape (wait until all icons rotate and it goes really in landscape)\r\n3. Start Safari app\r\n4. Open example URL: http://www.tuckdesign.com/t.php (it has only simple html with 2 divs of which one has \"position:fixed\"\r\n5. See that \"wwww\" from fixed div (id=\"test\") is shown under adress bar, instead at bottom of the page\r\n6. This doesn't happen if you start safari in portrait orientation and later rotate to landscape!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDiv with fixed position should be rendered at bottom of page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDiv with fixed position is rendered under (or \"within\" address bar). Even window.innerHeight reports 44 (height of address bar)!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ (iOS8.1) simulator.
