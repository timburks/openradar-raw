    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen declaring a closure, I noticed that a simple change causes Xcode to mark it 'ambiguous'. For instance, I changed a println() statement with/without string interpolation.  One compiled normally, and the other failed to compile.  \r\n\r\nI'm using the Quick BDD Testing framework, but this does not appear to be related to it.  Rather, it seems to be a problem with the Developer Tools.\r\n\r\nAn example project with the bug is zipped and attached as well as two screenshots showing the output.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode Project\r\n2. Install Quick and Nimble for Testing\r\n3. Attempt to create a beforeEach closure in a QuickConfigurator that prints the metadata.\r\n4. Switch it to be string interpolated, or surround it by other statements.\r\n5. Observe\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError: Ambitious use of 'beforeEach' or other Closure.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\nOS X Version 10.10.2 (14C81f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a workaround that works...\r\n1. Delete derived data\r\n2. Clean the project\r\n\r\nUploads:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32805057/Archive.zip"
