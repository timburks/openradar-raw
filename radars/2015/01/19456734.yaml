    description: "I would like to see some kind of control that adds support for a ‚Äùticker\" or \"scrolling\" label that would scroll horizontally, either automatically or through some user interaction, to reveal wrapped text.\n\nObviously the available width on the watch to show text content, even long names or headings, is fairly limited. The only real option is to either truncate it or wrap to 2-3 lines. \n\nThere are situations where neither are really desirable though, so I wanted to see if support for some kind of ticker was in the cards."
