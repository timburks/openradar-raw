    description: "Sample project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/eevnt7w1hjw5lda/DBActionSheetTester.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter tapping on a button in a UIActionSheet, the action sheet gets dismissed but continues to retain the root view controller of the UIWindow. The root view controller remains in-memory even after we replaced the window's root view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a UIActionSheet\r\n2. Dismiss by tapping on the destructive button\r\n3. Replace the UIWindow's root view controller\r\n4. Note that the old root view controller remains in memory\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe old root view controller should be released.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe old root view controller remains in memory indefinitely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing the new UIAlertController seems to work as expected and does not cause a leak.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air Simulator + Device"
