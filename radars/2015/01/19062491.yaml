    description: "Summary:\r\nAs a user, I'd like to be able to make the content of a bug report public. This way, when another user files a bug report and it is subsequently closed as duplicate, he's able to see the full discussion of the original bug report and participate to it. It is also valuable to discuss workarounds with engineers involved in the product for which the problem report is being created.\r\n\r\nMaking a bug report public should also make it searchable from the \"Search\" function of the Bug Reporter web UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a checkbox to \"Make this bug report public\" so that the problem report shows up in searches and is publicly visible by other users who may have reported a duplicate problem.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
