    description: "Summary:\r\nAS a user of OS X, WHEN iTunes launches I DECLINE the license agreement as I do not wish to use the application and use a different application to play music files.\r\n\r\nRegardless of my choice on the license screen, iTunes associates itself with music files (i.e. mp3). This is unexpected behaviour. The correct process should be:\r\n\r\nGIVEN that I am shown the iTunes license agreement\r\nWHEN I accept that agreement\r\nTHEN iTunes should start the file association process\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Remove all iTune preferences (via Terminal) as follows:\r\n\r\nrm -rf /Library/iTunes\r\nrm -rf /Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/*iTunes*\r\nrm -rf /Users/[username]/Library/Caches/*iTunes*\r\nrm -rf /Users/[username]/Library/*iTunes*\r\n\r\n2. Install an MP3 player application other than iTunes (i.e. Vox) and check that this application opens MP3 files by opening an MP3 file.\r\n\r\n3. Open the iTunes application - you should expect to see the iTunes license agreement at this stage\r\n\r\n4. Decline the license agreement\r\n\r\n5. Open an MP3 file\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: Vox opens and plays the file\r\nActual behaviour: iTunes opens and prompts with the license agreement\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVox opens and plays the file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n iTunes opens and prompts with the license agreement\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.1 and iTunes 12.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.10.1"
