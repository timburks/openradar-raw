    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you change an image catalog to be device specific for Apple Watch, the UI is not refreshed to remove the iPhone and iPad slots, even though the checkboxes are unchecked correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Image Catalog\r\n2. Change to Device Specific. iPhone and iPad are checked by default\r\n3. Click the checkbox for Apple Watch\r\n4. The checkboxes for iPhone and iPad are unchecked, but the slots are still there\r\n5. Check and uncheck iPhone and iPad independently, and the UI is then updated so that the slots are gone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the iPhone and iPad checkboxes are unchecked, the UI should update as well to remove the slots for these devices' images\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe checkboxes are unchecked, but the slots remain until you manually re-check and uncheck each one\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 4"
