    description: "Summary:\r\nMonths ago, I searched for \"newegg\" in the App Store on my iPad, and ever since then, when I launch the App Store app, the search is pre-populated with \"newegg\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On the last version of iOS 7, or possibly it was an iOS 8 beta, open the App Store on an iPad mini with Retina display and search for \"newegg\" (no quotes).\r\n2. Continue updating the apps \r\n3. Notice that every time you open the App Store app from a cold launch (force quit, reboot device, etc), and go to the Updates or Purchased tab, the text \"newegg\" is in the search bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClearing the search or searching for something else would remember the contents of the search field next time I launch the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClearing the search or searching for something else has no effect. The next time the app is killed and relaunched, \"newegg\" is back in the search field.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 [12B466]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 2 32 GB space gray\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
