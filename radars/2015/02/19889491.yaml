    description: "When using the standard iOS simulator address book, ABAddressBookCopyPeopleWithName() doesn't return any results when searching for any of the names such as \"Appleseed\".\r\n\r\nThe records do show up when using ABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeople().\r\n\r\nApparently the composite name field isn't correctly populated for the Simulator database. When editing the \"John Appleseed\" record once it's subsequently found by ABAddressBookCopyPeopleWithName(). The same applies to the other standard records."
