        Summary:
        When creating a property with a didSet it treats the property as a computed property even though its not.  The error says a computed type must have an explicit type but i don’t *want* a computed property.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a swift class
        2. Create a variable with a default value and a didSet

        Expected Results:
        It should compile without error and it should not be a computed property

        Actual Results:
        You get a compile time error saying ‘Computed property must have an explicit type’

        Regression:
        always in Xcode 6.3 and I believe 6.1.1 as well.
