    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm currently working on an update to an app. Part of the update is WatchKit support, and I do not plan to release this update until iOS 8.2 is released. However, there are a number of other changes in the app, and I need to test those changes. I can't afford to do all my testing at the last minute. This leaves me with three options:\r\n\r\n- Maintain two versions of the app throughout testing. This wouldn't be too bad, but trying to merge changes between project.pbxproj files is a nightmare. (My WatchKit app was basically done but now I need to rebuild the project after a botched merge.)\r\n\r\n- Go back to using Microsoft's HockeyApp for beta testing. This is the best option right now and it's really disappointing.\r\n\r\n- Just stop bothering with beta versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and archive app with a beta version of Xcode.\r\n2. Submit that archive to iTunes Connect.\r\n3. Go to itunesconnect.apple.com\r\n4. Select My Apps, then the app, then Prerelease\r\n5. Refresh a bunch of times until the build is done processing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build should be available for external beta testing. The only thing that should be prohibited is submitting a build for the App Store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"External testing is not supported for builds that have been created with a beta version of Xcode or iOS.\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't know how we're supposed to keep up with anything as it is. I'm juggling three versions of Xcode right now. Considering how frustrating this problem already is, I can't imagine how awful it's going to be when it's time to start testing with iOS 9. We usually get, what, like a 7-10 days between GM and release? So if I'm lucky I have maybe a few days for external testing before I submit my update if I want it to be available at launch?\r\n\r\nTestFlight has been wonderful overall. Most of the issues it has are minor enough that it's still a huge improvement over previous options. But because of this issue I'm back to wasting *hours* of my time on things I shouldn't have to. Before it was managing UUIDs and provisioning profiles, now it's maintaining multiple projects for a single release."
