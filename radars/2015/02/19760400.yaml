        Summary:
        I have a Finder alias in a folder that I keep open in a tab of two different Finder windows (open in two separate spaces). When I restart, only one of them will ever restore, never both.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set up OS X with at least two spaces
        2. Open a finder window with 5 tabs in Space 1
        3. Create an alias in the Music folder that points to a subfolder of Documents
        4. Open the alias in the second tab of the Finder window in Space 1
        5. Open a Finder window in Space 2 with 6 tabs
        6. Open the alias created in step 3 in the second tab of Space 2â€™s Finder window
        7. Restart the computer

        Expected Results:
        All Finder tabs are restored as you left them, with the alias in the Music folder open in the second tab of the Finder windows of both spaces

        Actual Results:
        The Finder window in Space 1 opens with only 4 tabs, skipping over the alias that was open in the second tab. The window in Space 2 restores fine
