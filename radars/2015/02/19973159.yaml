        Summary:
        With the IBDesignable, I think it would be great if Interface Builder support Font attribute for IBInspectable and User Defined Runtime Attribute.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a subclass of UIView and add the IBInspectable font property.
        2. Add a view of UIView subclassed into Interface Builder.

        Expected Results:
        Can config the IBInspectable font property.

        Actual Results:
        Interface Builder doesnâ€™t allow that.

        Regression:
