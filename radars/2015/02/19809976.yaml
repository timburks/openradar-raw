    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating simple model objects, I often don't want to specify a superclass when adding a new Swift class to a project, but the Xcode new file wizard insists on me providing one\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File >> New >> File\r\n2. Select iOS >> Sourc >> Cocoa Touch Class\r\n3. Click Next\r\n4. Select Language of Swift\r\n4. Enter a class name\r\n5. Delete anything in the Subclass field\r\n6. Observe the Next button is disabled\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to add a Swift class without specifying a superclass and get something like this:\r\n\r\nclass MyModel {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn order to complete the wizard, I have to specify a superclass and then delete it afterwards. This is counter productive.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3 (6D520o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
