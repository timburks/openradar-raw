        Summary:
        Asking the user for a URL can seem simple on the surface, but can become very complicated when you allow the user to not include a scheme or include non url encoded characters. User’s are use to entering URLs into Safari, which handles many different versions of input and does it’s very best to convert the user’s input into a valid URL, using http as a default.

        For apps, it would be best that they not only be able to convert user input into valid URLs easily, but to do so exactly the same as Safari and other apps so the user is familiar with how they can enter URLs.
