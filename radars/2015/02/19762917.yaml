    description: "Summary:\r\nMany (actually most) countries use a 50Hz mains frequency instead of 60Hz like in the US. This causes heavy flickering (since lights also \"flicker\" with 50 Hz) when using the Slo-Mo camera rendering these recordings pretty useless.\r\nPlease add a 200fps mode (or 250) so the camera can operate in all countries where 50Hz mains frequency is used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Travel to a country where 50 Hz is used (I recommend Munich, Germany so I can buy you a beer).\r\n2. Use the Slo-Mo camera in an environment with electrical lights.\r\n3. Find that the result is flickering a lot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHaving non-flickering video\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHeavily flickering slo-mo video\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'trim.BB3BFE2D-CC1C-4A5D-A55B-0D31FC4D8970.MOV' was successfully uploaded."
