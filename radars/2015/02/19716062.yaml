        Summary:
        JSON dictionaries have an implicit order to their keys. However, when converted to NSDictionary the keys are hashed and ordered for performance. While this is good default behavior, it makes some tasks impossible to use NSJSONSerialization for.

        Foundation should include an ordered dictionary type that developers can pass in to NSJSONSerialization that will be encoded with the correct order it was created with. Likewise, there should be a reading option that causes NSJSONSerialization to return that same ordered dictionary with the order the JSON file uses.
