    description: "Summary:\nI have a Swift app in Xcode 6.3b2, but when I try to submit to Testflight using Application Loader, it fails with many errors of the form ‘ERROR ITMS-90209: “Invalid Segment Alignment. The app binary at ‘spies.app/Frameworks/libswiftCore.dylib’ does not have proper segment alignment. Try rebuilding the app with the latest Xcode version.”’\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open attached project.\n2. Archive app.\n3. Hit “Export” to save the app to an .ipa (can’t use Submit to App Store flow because of rdar://19809552)\n4. Choose “Save for iOS App Store Deployment” and save to file \n5. Open Application Loader 3.0 (620)\n6. Hit Deliver your App, find the file, hit Next.\n\nExpected Results:\nApplication Loader submits the build to iTunes Connect for Testflight testing.\n\nActual Results:\nApplication Loader displays 18 errors like this:\n\nERROR ITMS-90209: “Invalid Segment Alignment. The app binary at ‘spies.app/Frameworks/libswiftCore.dylib’ does not have proper segment alignment. Try rebuilding the app with the latest Xcode version.”\n\nThere is one error for each Swift dylib - CoreAudio, CoreGraphics, Darwin, UIKit, etc.\n\nRegression:\nSubmission to Testflight worked fine in Xcode 6.1. It’s non-trivial to re-test Xcode 6.1 with this project since it doesn’t build anymore with all our Swift 1.2 changes.\n\nNotes:\nI have seen other people on Stack Overflow and the Dev Forums hitting this issue once working around rdar://19809552. I’ve filed this as a separate issue because it doesn’t seem like it would have the same root cause as rdar://19809552."
