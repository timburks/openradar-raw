        Summary:
        FileVault 2 login window (EFI) does not allow username and password fields instead of each user added to FileVault

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. install or power on machine with Mac OS X
        2. Bind to directory service like AD
        3. Encrypt machine with AD account
        4. Restart computer

        Expected Results:
        Username and password fields should appear

        Actual Results:
        Added user names are shown, with no indication what directory they are from

        Regression:
        All 10.7+ versions of Mac OS X

        Notes:
        Affected install count: 423 Macs at Montefiore Medical Center, NY, and soon to be Albert Einstein School of Medicine
        Also frustrating that radar 19130917 was closed when functional issues are still present with syncing password changes to the login window
