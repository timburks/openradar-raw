    description: I created a sample app that compiles an iOS framework that reproduces the issue. I simplified it greatly and it is still producing the same seg fault. Switching to a < operator with a "+ 1" compiles fine. I wanted to report the issue so that your team is at least aware of the issue even though I found a temp workaround.
