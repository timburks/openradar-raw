    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen manipulating a surface with a significant amount of behind-window blending, such as the New Tab page in Safari 8, window actions such as dragging, resizing, and minimizing are extremely choppy.\r\n\r\nThere is some console spam such during a drag: \"Surface testing disallowed updates for x sequential attemptsâ€¦\", followed by \"Surface test allowed updates after 11 attempts\", both attributed to WindowServer. These seem to come from a tick callback in CoreGraphics.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install OS X 10.10.3.\r\n2. Open Safari 8.\r\n3. Open a New Tab page\r\n4. Drag the window\r\n5. Observe\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA dragged window with a large behind-window blurring surface has all the speed of a non-transparent window, or the same window with Reduce Transparency activated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe drag drops a large number of frames and lags behind the cursor with transparency enabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBug does not effect smaller sources of behind-window blending, such as the Notification Center and source lists, even a significantly sized one like the No Message Selected pane in Mail.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013). Effect is mitigated - though still occurs - when discrete graphics are activated. Bug does not occur with Reduce Transparency enabled.\r\nzw.spx - configuration file has been successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WindowServer perf bug.zip' and 'zw.spx' were successfully uploaded."
