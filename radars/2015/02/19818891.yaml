        Summary:
        Clicking the “Resources and Help” section in iTunes Connect leads to https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/resources_page, which contains a link to the “Transporter User Guide”:

        https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/resources/download/TransporterQuickStartUserGuide/pdf

        This is actually a link to the quick start guide, which is a brief overview compared to the real user guide. The full guide is available at:

        https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/resources/download/TransporterUserGuide/pdf

        I was fortunate to guess this, because I can’t find a link to the full user guide anywhere in iTunes Connect.
