        Summary:

        When adding a target to a UIControl object via addTarget(action:forControlEvents), it accepts a private method as the action parameter, but then crashes at runtime with an unrecognized selector.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Write a private function
        2. Add it as a target of a UIControl object
        3. Trigger the appropriate control event
        4. Observe unrecognized selector crash

        Expected Results:

        The code should either not compile OR compile with a warning OR it should be possible to use a private method, so you donâ€™t have to expose what might be an internal implementation detail.

        Actual Results:

        No compilation warning and a runtime crash. This is a missed opportunity for the Swift language to catch a potential bug earlier in the development cycle.

        Regression:
