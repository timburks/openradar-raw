    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8.1.3, if the user taps two UIActionSheet buttons at the same time, the app becomes completely unresponsive to user interactions. Note that this issue does *not* occur with UIActionController. It is only present in UIActionSheet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. User taps two UIActionSheet buttons at the same time.\r\n2. The delegate method actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex: is called twice (once for each button).\r\n3. The delegate method actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex: is *never* called.\r\n4. The app becomes completely unresponsive. Inspecting the application's current key window shows that it is a _UIAlertControllerShimPresenterWindow.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect one of two outcomes. Either actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex: should be called twice and the _UIAlertControllerShimPresenterWindow should be removed, OR the UIActionSheet should not allow multiple touches. Either way, the app should not become unresponsive to user interactions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application becomes unresponsive to user interactions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the attached sample project for a reproducible test case.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ActionSheetBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
