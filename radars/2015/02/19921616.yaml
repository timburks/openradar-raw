    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the current version of xScope, there is a memory leak caused by a change in OS X 10.10.2. While the Loupe is in the background grabbing the screen, something in the frameworks is leaving images in the autorelease pool. The fix is literally two lines of code that forces the pool to empty.\r\n\r\nBut that's not why I'm writing now.\r\n\r\nThis fix was submitted two weeks ago on February 2nd. A week later it went into review and was quickly rejected. The problem was that a buy button was accessible from our Help window.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the help is static and built into the app, but there is a part online that we can update easily. This makes it really easy easy for us to addtips and other useful information for our customers. But since it's just a web browser, it's possible to wander into a part of our site that shows a header with mentions the word \"buy\" which is not allowed per rule 7.15. (Yes, the buy button is for something the customer has already purchased and is actively in the process of using, but technically it's still a violation.)\r\n\r\nMy issue is the way that we must fix these problems. In this particular case, the issue was resolved by editing some HTML on our server, not by changing anything in the app itself. But we still must submit a \"new\" binary and go through the lengthy review process again. This is a huge waste of time for both developers and app reviewers (who are clearly lagging behind these days.)\r\n\r\nI think there's an easy way to fix these minor transgressions that would benefit both parties: add a new kind of approval with strings attached. A \"Must Fix for Next Release\" state where the app can go into \"Ready for Sale\" but the issue remains in the Resolution Center. At that point, both the app reviewers and developer know that an issue has to be dealt with before it's approved the next time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
