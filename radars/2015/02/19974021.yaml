    description: "Summary:\nFor example, protocol NSObjectProtocol is not tagged as `class`, which means that a struct could conform to it, but that wouldn’t make sense.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nCreate an Objective-C protocol: `P`.\n\nExpected Results:\nIt is imported in Swift as `@objc protocol P` or at least `protocol P: class`.\n\nActual Results:\nProtocol is defined simply as `protocol P`.\n\nNotes: \nThe compiler actually prevents you from doing something like `struct S: NSObjectProtocol`, with an error “non-class type ’S’ cannot conform to class protocol ‘NSObjectProtocol’”, but I see no indication of that in the Swift auto generated header."
