    description: "Summary:\r\nI had a recent metadata rejection for and iOS app and the \"Submit for Review\" button became enabled. The reviewer informed me that I only needed to respond to their message, but I clicked the \"Submit for Review\" button which put my app back into the review queue which took another week.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Submit an app for review.\r\n2. Receive a metadata rejection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Submit for Review\" button should not be enabled again because the metadata rejection does not require a new binary. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Submit for Review\" button becomes enabled and clicking this button will resubmit the app and place it back into the review queue."
