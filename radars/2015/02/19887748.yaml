    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring a facetime call on a mac, a detaching of my S/PDIF cable connected audio receiver results in the internal speaker making a short crushing sound and then no further audio from the other end can be heard.\r\nInterestingly enough, if the cable is reconnected, one hears the other side again. If the cable was disconnected before the facetime call was initiated, it also works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a receiver via S/PDIF and play some audio (to make sure, the connection really is active)\r\n2. get called via facetime\r\n3. during the call, yank out the cable\r\n4. no audio should be heard aside of a short crunshing sound\r\n5. replugging the cable will restore the audio\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nno dropout of audio when disconnecting the cable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncrunshing sound and no further audio from the other end of the call is heard\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 14C109 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Late 2009\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
