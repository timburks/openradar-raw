        Summary:
        The edges are wrong for a view controller with the following hierarchy.

        -Navigation Controller
        	-UIViewController
        		-UIViewContainer
        			-UIPageViewController
        				-UIViewController
        					-UITableView

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Setup the above view hierarchy.
        2. Notice that the table view always appears underneath the navigation bar.

        Expected Results:
        1. Setup the above view hierarchy.
        2. The table view appears below the navigation bar and not underneath it.

        Actual Results:
        The tableview appears underneath the navigation bar and not underneath it.

        Regression:
        None.
