    description: "Summary:\nThe ‘autocomplete=\"new-password\"’ attribute on an <input> tag lets you identify a password-changing field to autofill. However, there’s no corresponding \"new-username\" value.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Write a web app that allows you to change an account’s username, with code something like: \n    <input type=\"hidden\" autocomplete=\"username\" value=\"foo\">\n    <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" autocomplete=\"new-username\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" value=\"foo\">\n2. Load the “change username” page in Safari.\n3. Change the username field to “bar”.\n4. Submit the form.\n\nExpected Results:\nOn a successful result from the server, the keychain entry for “foo” is changed to be for “bar” instead, probably with a confirmation prompt like the one Safari shows for password changes.\n\nActual Results:\nSafari doesn’t understand ‘autocomplete=\"new-username\"’, and so it doesn’t do anything special with this form.\n\nNotes:\nIt might be nice if, instead of requiring the hidden field, Safari looked at the new-username field’s defaultValue to determine the old username. This isn't important for new-password fields because they don't contain the current password (at least if the passwords are being stored securely), but new-username fields are usually filled in."
