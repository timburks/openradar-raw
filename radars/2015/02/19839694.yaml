    description: "Summary:\r\nI created a sample project that demonstrates the bug. I am seeing incorrect height calculations for newly inserted cells when using multi-line labels in a row controller.\r\n\r\nCase 1\r\nI have a label with lines = 2, and the default text in the storyboard stretches across two lines. When I insert a new row with text that fits on a single line, I will see a gap between the new cell and the one below it. See Gap_ScreenShot.png attached.\r\n\r\nCase 2\r\nI have a label with lines = 2, and the default text in the storyboard is on a single line. When I insert a new row with text that stretches across 2 lines, the new row will overlap the row below it. See Overlap_ScreenShot.png attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCase 1 will run by default. To run Case 2, shorten the label text in the storyboard to fit on a single line.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 Beta 5"
