    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Java runtime does not detect clipboard changes if they are made by a background application. The workaround is to switch to another application and back to the Java application so that the clipboard gets updated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. While using a Java-based application (e.g. the Oxygen XML editor), copy some text.\r\n2. Have a background application modify the clipboard (e.g. TextExpander).\r\n3. Without leaving the Java-based application, paste the clipboard contents.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe clipboard as modified by the background application is pasted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe contents copied from within the Java-based application is pasted rather than what was placed on the clipboard by the background application. If using TextExpander, for example, inserting a snippet will have the result of pasting the Java application's last clipboard state rather than the snippet contents.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.2\r\n\r\njava version \"1.6.0_65\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-466.1-11M4716)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-466.1, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n(Also tested with Java 8.)"
