        Summary:
        When you provide a command’s argument (of type “file”) using a path string, and not as a file handle or alias, the command creates a valid NSURL, but with no file access. This is not obvious, and provides a poor user experience for scripting clients

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Extract, build, and run the attached sample project
        2. Compile and run Test Script.applescript

        Expected Results:
        Script returns “This is some text”

        Actual Results:
        The app returns an error “you don’t have permission to view it”
