        Summary:
        Rendering a PDF locks up the render operation, never returning.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open attached example.
        Run.
        Observe that it is looping after rendering the first image successfully.

        There is no crash, but the renderer is never finishing (thus, I can’t provide a crash log since it’s a hang)

        Expected Results:
        Should render as expected.

        Actual Results:
        Freezes/Loops somewhere in CGImageReadGetCachedImageBlockData

        Regression:
        Seems to be related to AppleJPEG. Works fine in iOS 7.

        Notes:
        Removing CGContextSetInterpolationQuality fixes the issue. kCGInterpolationHigh or kCGInterpolationMedium cause a freeze. This took a crazy long time to find out… appreciate any feedback on this.
