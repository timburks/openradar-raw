    description: "The attached project should give an “expression too complex” error in LinearMotorTests.swift -> testSimpleLPProblem. The expression is just:\n\n        3 * x[0] + x[1] - 2 * x[3] - x[4] - x[7] <= 14\n\nAdmittedly, all of the operators and most of the operands are custom. But it still doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of ambiguity involved. I just thought I’d mention that this error message is still occurring as of Swift 1.2. \n\nI’m happy to provide more detail if it would be helpful."
