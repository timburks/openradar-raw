    description: "Summary:\r\nLinks in Reminders aren't styled properly nor do clicks on them open them in the default web browser except when the list containing the link is initially not the shown list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new item in Reminders. Type a link (e.g. \"http://www.apple.com/\") into the body of the item.\r\n2. Click outside of the item to end editing.\r\n3. Note that the link you just typed isn't styled to convey that it's a link.\r\n4. Click the (unstyled) link and note that the item goes into editing mode.\r\n5. While the item is still shown, quit the Reminders app, and then reopen it.\r\n6. Note that the item is shown again (because Reminders brings you back to where you were) and that it continues to not be styled.\r\n7. Click the link and note that the item goes into editing mode.\r\n8. Switch to a different reminders list using the left sidebar then back to the original list that contains the item you made in step 1.\r\n9. Note that the link is now styled as a link - it's blue and underlined.\r\n10. Click the link and note that the page for it is opened in your default browser.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLink should be styled as a link and clicks on it should open the corresponding page in the default web browser from at least step 3 onward. This does not occur until step 9.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn steps 3, 4, 6, and 7, link text is not styled as a link nor does clicking it open the corresponding page in the default web browser. The expected functionality is seen only after switching away to a different list and then back to the original list."
