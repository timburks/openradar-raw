    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen asking mach_vm_read_overwrite to read a range spanning COW -> PRV -> COW pages, a kernel panic is triggered. Please see the attached test-case, which crashes the XNU kernel on both Mac OS X Yosemite and iOS 8.1. This was discovered after www.frida.re triggered it by accident.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the xnu-panic universal binary on Mac or iOS, or compile xnu-panic.c yourself and run it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo kernel panic.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKernel panic.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 (probably many other versions too)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny hardware.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'xnu-panic.c' and 'xnu-panic' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n(Attachments not available here. See https://medium.com/@oleavr/diy-kernel-panic-os-x-and-ios-in-10-loc-c250d9649159 for details.)"
