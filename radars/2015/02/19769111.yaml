        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Clone this branch https://github.com/robrix/List/tree/swift-1.2b1-crasher
        2. Clone the dependencies
        3. Open the workspace
        4. Build


        Expected Results:
        I expected the compiler to build successfully, or to error out and tell me why.


        Actual Results:
        It crashed, apparently while typechecking the analysis function:

        1.	While type-checking 'analysis' at /Users/rob/Developer/Projects/List/List/List.swift:54:9



        Regression:
        This does not crash in 1.1.


        Notes:
        A very similar function, `either`, in my Either library (https://github.com/robrix/Either) does not crash the compiler.
