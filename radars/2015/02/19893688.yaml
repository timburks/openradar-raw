        Summary:
        If you set the image on a navigation bar that is not the standard size you get a black status bar if the height of the image matches the frame

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open sample project - run as is to see working version with no issue.  Then comment out line 37 of RadarNavigationBar.swift and uncomment line 33. Now run again and see that you now have a black status bar for some reason.

        Expected Results:
        If you use line 33 you should not get a black status bar….

        Actual Results:
        You get a black status bar that doesn’t make sense.  If you don’t set the image it does not appear black.

        Regression:
        always on yosemite Xcode 6.3 beta
