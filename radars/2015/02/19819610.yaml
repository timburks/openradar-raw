    description: "Summary:\r\nTypically, when a container view controller resizes one of its child view controllers, it will call viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: to let it know that it will be resized. This allows the child view controller to respond appropriately to the change in size, including animating any necessary changes.\r\n\r\nA UISplitViewController is a container view controller. When you change its preferredPrimaryColumnWidthFraction property, it can resize its child view controllers. However, even when it does resize its children, it does not call viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator:. This makes adjusting to the new size much more difficult. E.G. in my case, I have a UIScrollView whose x contentOffset I need to adjust according to the size of the master view controller's view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook at the sample project attached.\r\n\r\nAlternatively:\r\n1. Create a UISplitViewController\r\n2. Implement viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: in your master view controller\r\n3. Create a way to change the preferredPrimaryColumnWidthFraction property on the split view controller\r\n4. Observe that viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: doesn't get called on your master view controller (nor on your detail view controller for that matter)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nviewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: should be called with the new size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nviewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: is never called\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466) - iOS 8.2 beta 5 (12D5480a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device that supports an expanded UISplitViewController\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestSplitResizing.zip' was successfully uploaded."
