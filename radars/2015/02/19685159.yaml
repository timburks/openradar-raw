        Summary:
        At present, FaceTime ducks audio when youâ€™re on a call. It would be nice if the default behavior (potentially with an option to turn it off) would be to pause music played back through iTunes

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Play a song in iTunes
        2. Make or accept a FaceTime audio (or cell via iPhone) call

        Expected Results:
        iTunes playback pauses, and resumes when the call ends (the same way the iPhone works)

        Actual Results:
        Music continues playing, at a barely audible level, returning to normal volume when the call ends
