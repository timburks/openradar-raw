        Summary:
        When using target action, at least with UIRefreshControl, to call a swift function that has a default value, the app crashes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a UITableViewController with a UIRefreshControl
        2. Add a target to the UIRefreshControl such as `refresh:`
        3. Create the refresh function with this signature `@objc func reload(sender: UIRefreshControl? = nil)`

        Expected Results:
        `reload:` is called and everything is fine.

        Actual Results:
        The application crashes with `unrecognized selector sent to instance`

        Notes:
        See the attached project for an example.
