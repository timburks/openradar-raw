    description: "Playgrounds are so useful! But so messy!\n\nI’m sure use patterns vary, but I find that 99% of the time I create a new playground, I just want to play around with some snippet of code independent of any particular project or context. Given that, it’s a bit annoying to have to name and save every playground manually, as if it were a valuable treasure. It should be a one-keystroke operation to open a new playground window. The ones I want to save, I’ll name and store.\n\nAt the very least, it would be nice to be able to set a default playground folder where playgrounds are saved by default. I use playgrounds a lot, so they create a lot of clutter unless I keep them in a playground ghetto. \n\nBetter yet, just autosave them under ~/Library/Developer and just let me move out the ones that are special."
