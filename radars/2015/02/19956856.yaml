        Summary:
        When using a `let` with an NSPoint and then trying to alter a value on the point, the error message reads "Binary operator '-=' cannot be applied to two CGFloat operands" which isn't descriptive of the actual issue.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        let originPoint: NSPoint = NSWindow().frame.origin
        originPoint.y -= originFrame.height

        Expected Results:
        The error should mention something about how constant points cannot be changed.

        Actual Results:
        The error reads "Binary operator '-=' cannot be applied to two CGFloat operands"
