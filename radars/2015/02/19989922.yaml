    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Xcode 6.3 beta 2 release notes describe a new attribute \"noescape,\" which specifies that a given block argument won't be captured and escape the receiving method. However, this attribute fails to produce a warning in pure Objective-C code when the method does in fact cause the given block to escape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project\r\n2. Build it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-invokeBlockLater: produces a warning because the given block, despite being declared with __attribute__((noescape)), is captured in both the lastLaterBlock and the laterBlocks properties.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo warning is produced.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nSample project at https://github.com/lithium3141/NoescapeTest"
