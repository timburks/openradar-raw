        Summary:
        Found this by accident while refactoring to do away with the @autoclosure use in Memo ( :( :( :( :( :( ). Replaced a ( with a { and suddenly everything was on fire.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Clone the repo & check out the branch for this PR: https://github.com/robrix/Memo/pull/8
        2. Clone the dependencies: git submodule update --init --recursive
        3. Build.


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to fail and give me some reasonable error along the lines of “um, I think you wanted a parenthesis, not a curly brace.”


        Actual Results:
        Crash.


        Regression:
        This doesn’t crash in Swift 1.1.
