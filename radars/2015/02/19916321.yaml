        Summary:
        I think this might be related to some issues I’ve been seeing where SourceKitService crashes hard any time I look at the Either.swift file in my project. Box is being imported from a separate module but SourceKitService may not know that, and thus it implodes.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to compile this:

        enum E {
        	case C(Box<Int>)

        	var c: Box<Int>? {
        		switch self {
        		case let C(c): return c
        		}
        	}
        }


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to error on the use of undeclared type 'Box', but not to crash.


        Actual Results:
        It printed errors about the use of the undeclared type 'Box', and then it crashed.


        Regression:
        Using Array<Int> instead of Box<Int> does not crash. Providing a definition of Box does not crash.


        Notes:
        Encountered this while pursuing a workaround to rdar://19673469 — which may or may not be related.
