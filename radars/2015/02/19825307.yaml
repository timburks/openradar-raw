        Summary:

        When making a connection between a Storyboard and a UIViewController subclass, the pop-up connection inspector (which lets you set whether you are making an Action or Outlet connection, the name and type etc.) defaults to a Connection type of an Outlet. If you enter a name with a colon, the [Connect] button becomes disabled. Instead of doing this, it would be useful if the Connection type automatically changed to Action, since this is clearly what your intention is.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Make a connection between a button in a Storyboard and a UIViewController subclass
        2. Observe the connection type defaults to Outlet.
        3. Enter a name with a colon on the end
        4. Observe the Connect button becomes disabled and Connection type remains an Outlet

        Expected Results:

        The Connection type should change to Action if you specify a name ending in a colon.

        Actual Results:

        The Connect button becomes disabled and Connection type remains an Outlet

        Regression:
