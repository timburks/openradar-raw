        Summary:
        In Xcode 6.1, we were able to create public extensions for generic types that existed in external modules. For example, I could create a public extension on Optional or Array. In Xcode 6.2, this ability was taken away. This feels like an arbitrary restriction, since I can still create extensions on non-generic types from external modules. This restriction should be lifted, since it seriously limits the ability to add useful functionality to types built into the standard lib.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an extension on String with a public function
        2. Create an extension on Optional with a public function

        Expected Results:
        Both extensions are able to be compiled

        Actual Results:
        The extension on String can be compiled, but the extension on Optional throws an error

        Regression:
        This does not occur in Xcode 6.1
