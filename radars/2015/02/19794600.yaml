    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari, if Javascript gives focus to a `<select>` element outside the viewport, the element is given focus, and the page scrolls to show the focused element, but the UI for the options is not shown on screen, meaning the user must tap the screen to unfocused the element, then tap again.\r\n\r\nI’ve provided an example page that demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Focus on a `select` element outside the viewport, using javascript\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page scrolls to the focused element, and the UI to select options is visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page scrolls to the focused element, but the UI to the select options is not visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466); iOS 8.1 (12B411, iOS Simulator)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue does not occur on iPhone, as the UI for selecting an option is fixed to the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nOstensibly, on iPad, the UI is showing, but is positioned before the page scrolls to the element. So when the scroll happens, it’s outside the visible area of the screen.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini with Retina Display, iPad Air (iOS Simulator), iPad 2 (iOS Simulator)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nExample: http://f.cl.ly/items/3V430T3M1x392O3m3M3g/index.html"
