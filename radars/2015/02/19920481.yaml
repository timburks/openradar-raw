        Summary:

        Sometimes it is necessary to view/manipulate images in the Image Asset editor which consist purely of white, but these become impossible to see on a white background. It would therefore be beneficial if one could change the background color of the Xcode Image Asset editor

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Manipulate images consisting purely of white pixels in the Image Assert editor
        2. Observe a low degree of visibility around white-on-white

        Expected Results:

        An option to change the displayed background color in the image asset editor

        Actual Results:

        White-on-white - invisibile!

        Regression:

        N/A
