    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be great if a tool for formatting the code in a standard way like golang gofmt (https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) for swift.\r\n\r\nWhy is this necessary?\r\n\r\n- In a development team each person will have its own code style. Further more imported external 3rd party libraries will have its own style too. This lead to a messy style through the entire application. --> A formatting tool is needed\r\n\r\n- In code reviews will be a bit faster since developers don't need to discuss styling stuff, new engineers might not now the style of the company or team. --> A formatting tools is needed and it must be standard and builtin\r\n\r\nFor example, as of now we can write:\r\n\r\nfunc method(param: Type) {\r\n    return\r\n}\r\nfunc method ( param: Type )\r\n{\r\n    return\r\n}\r\nfunc method(param:Type){return}\r\n\r\nAnd several more.\r\n\r\nFor objective-c we have clang-format but is not standard and is it not build. Since is it not builtin not everybody knows about it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee Description.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHave a tool, let's say: \"swiftfmt\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncode formatted standardly in a uniform way in the entire swift universe. (When the formatting tools is activated)"
