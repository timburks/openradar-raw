    description: In Finder, it's possible to apply color labels to arbitrary files.  It would be useful for me, as a graphic designer, for these color labels on font files to be displayed when choosing a font in other applications --- the NSFontPanel should apply the specified color label to highlight the table row highlight.  Additionally, it would be handy to see and be able to easily change these color labels in Font Book.
