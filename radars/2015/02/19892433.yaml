    description: "Summary:\r\nIn OS X Safari, a normal focused <input type=\"password\"> field displays an indicator icon in the field when Caps Lock is on. However, styling a <input type=\"password\"> with `display: block;` causes this indicator to not be displayed. At the least, there should be a `-webkit` style to tell Safari to treat such fields the same as their `display: inline(-block)` counterparts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsbin.com/tulexi/2/edit in Safari on OS X.\r\n2. Press the Caps Lock key on your keyboard to activate Caps Lock.\r\n3. Click into each of the <input type=\"password> fields on the page and look at the right side of the field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLike the rest of the fields, the first field (that says and is styled with \"display: block\") should show a right-aligned gray-and-white up-arrow icon, indicating that Caps Lock is active (see screenshot).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnlike the rest of the fields, the first field does not show any Caps Lock indicator icon.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0.3 (10600.3.18)\r\nPlatform: OS X version 10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOriginal Bootstrap bug report: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/15832\r\nWebKit bug report: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141804\r\nChrome 40 also suffers from the same bug: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=460200\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'safari-shot-cropped.png' was successfully uploaded."
