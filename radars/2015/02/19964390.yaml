    description: "Summary:\r\nI love FuzzyAutocomplete and it should be built in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install FuzzyAutocomplete via Alcatraz.\r\n2. Wonder how you ever lived without it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple acquires FuzzyAutocomplete and builds it into Xcode. It’s specifically useful when typing long names of things that differ only in small ways at the end. For example, the values for UIViewAutoresizing all share the first 26 characters, and without autocomplete you have to get through all of them* before you get to the important part.\r\n\r\n* I know about the Tab trick, but it’s not as flexible as FuzzyAutocomplete, and many people don’t know about the trick, or they use it wrongly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis has not happened yet.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLink to FuzzyAutocomplete: https://github.com/FuzzyAutocomplete/FuzzyAutocompletePlugin\r\nLink to Alcatraz: http://alcatraz.io"
