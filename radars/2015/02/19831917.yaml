    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPutting any computed property in the global scope will crash the Swift compiler:\r\n\r\npublic var workdirectory: String {\r\nget {\treturn \"\" }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSee also the attached example project which will crash when building.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave a computed property in the global scope\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCode compiles\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCompiler crashes\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIntroduced by Apple Swift version 1.2 (swiftlang-602.0.37.3 clang-602.0.37) - the code compiled fine with the Swift 1.1 compiler\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, I was unable to reproduce the problem when running swiftc on the command line, the problem seems to be specific to one of the options passed by Xcode by default."
