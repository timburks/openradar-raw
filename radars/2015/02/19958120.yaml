    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a website set as a \"home screen\" app and accessed via Guided Access, a message will appear every time there is an HTML form submission: \"Guided Access is Enabled. Triple-click the home button to exit.\" This message is unexpected simply because the user has submitted a form.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA simple 2-page example is attached. Configure Guided Access on the device and save the files on a web server. From that point the repro steps are:\r\n\r\n1. Visit the home page in the browser.\r\n2. Tap the share button then tap \"Add to Home Screen\" then tap \"Add\" to complete the process.\r\n3. Open the app from the home screen.\r\n4. Triple-click the home button to enable Guided Access.\r\n5. Tap the submit button.\r\n6. Note the message \"Guided Access is Enabled. Triple-click the home button to exit.\" that appears at the top of the screen.  That message should not appear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expected behavior is that the message should not appear every time the user submits a form.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message \"Guided Access is Enabled. Triple-click the home button to exit.\" appears every time the user submits a form.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 [12B466]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGuided Access is configured in the following way, but changes here had no impact on the behavior.\r\n\r\n• Sleep/Wake: enabled\r\n• Volume: disabled\r\n• Motion: enabled\r\n• Keyboards: enabled\r\n• Touch: enabled\r\n• Dictionary Lookup: enabled\r\n• Time Limit: disabled\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'index.html' and 'page2.html' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttp://jsbin.com/wecipi/1/\r\nhttp://jsbin.com/mohira/1/\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis is still a problem in iOS 8.2.\r\n\r\nThis is still a problem in iOS 8.3.\r\n\r\nThis is still a problem in iOS 8.4.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be fixed in iOS 9."
