        Summary:
        Custom NSSegmentedControls which have a different silhouette than the AppKit defaults (e.g. text-only, like the ones Xcode uses widely in e.g. its preferences) cannot easily draw focus rings correctly, because there’s no accessor for which segment is key. You can make the next/previous segments key, but can’t access the currently-key segment, which means you’d have to duplicate a lot of AppKit logic or access the private _keySegment method/ivar on NSSegmentedCell in order to draw the focus ring properly around just the key segment.

        This is nasty for accessibility purposes. Full keyboard access relies on you being able to tell what you’re doing, and this lapse in the API makes that difficult. Notably, Xcode opted not to do the work above, so it gets no focus rings for those controls, which is terrible.
