    description: "When accessing an element at a certain index, that index could be out of bounds. Everywhere else in swift where this situation would occur, an optional is returned to make it clear that a value may not be present and to avoid unnecessary crashes.\n\nThis also would avoid clunky boilerplate. Consider the following:\n\nvar element: AnyObject?\nif array.count >= 2 {\n    element = array[2]\n}\n\nvs:\n\nif let element = array[2] {\n    \n}\n\nAnd it would be easy to get the current behavior with a single character:\n\nlet element = array[2]!"
