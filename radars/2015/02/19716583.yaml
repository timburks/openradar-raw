    description: "My app is a tool specifically for copying the file path of selected items in the Finder. It then performs various transformations on that path. One of the options is to replace /Users/username with ~. To accomplish this, I rely on the above call. When the app was sandboxed, this feature suddenly stopped working, because stringByAbbreviatingWithTildeInPath always returns the original string with no replacements.\r\n\r\nI don't see a security risk here, and it is currently possible to get the home directory through other means (getpwuid), so I don't see why this call is not permissible. \r\n\r\nCan you please allow this to work in a sandbox?"
