    description: "Summary:\nA Swift class that has a property of an enum declared as NS_ENUM in a .h file, that is later used in an Obj-C file creates a non-compilable automatic -Swift.h header file. Specifically, the enum property in Swift class is imported as \n@property (nonatomic) enum enum enumVarName\n\nwhich doesnâ€™t compile.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nBuild the attached project\n\nExpected Results:\nCompilable code generation (only one enum in the property declaration)\n\nActual Results:\nWrong declaration\n\nRegression:\nBuilt just fine in Swift 1.1\n\nNotes:"
