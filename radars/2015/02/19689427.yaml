        Summary:
        Xibs have a systemVersion attribute in the <document> tag, which makes merging code among teammates on different system versions slightly annoying.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Author a xib on a computer running 10.10.1.
        2. Commit the xib to source control
        3. Edit that xib on a computer running 10.10.2.
        4. Submit your edits for code review.

        Expected Results:
        Within the limits of readable XML diffs, the xib changes should be reasonable.

        Actual Results:
        The xib changes include a systemVersion attribute in the <document> tag, indicating the OS X build number of the system that created the xib. Since the Xcode version is also embedded, and especially on iOS xibs, this seems irrelevant and it would be nice if it werenâ€™t mentioned at all.

        Regression:
        N/A
