        Summary:
        Quartz Composerâ€™s file format is some binary blob, which is not very version control friendly. It would very useful to have a (XML based?) file format, a la Interface Builder which is much easier to use with a version control system like git.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) check a .qtz file into a git repository
        2) change one connection in the Quartz Composer
        3) show the diff with git diff

        Expected Results:
        Diff in a text format

        Actual Results:
        No text diff

        Regression:
