    description: "Summary:\r\nI always find it needlessly difficult to add a new scheme for a specific target among the many dozens of targets available in my workspace. The problem would be dramatically reduced if some kind of winnowing down of options was supported in the \"New Scheme\" panel (see attached AddScheme.png).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project or workspace that has a significant number of targets to choose from.\r\n2. Select Product -> Scheme -> New Scheme from the menu bar.\r\n3. Attempt to type-select a target from the list.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list of available targets should be winnowed down, similarly to the way you can type-select a scheme name from the active scheme popup.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTyping is interpreted as selecting \"None\" at the top of the popup menu."
