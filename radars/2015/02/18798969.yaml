    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder certain circumstances, remote notifications using the Alert style never appear, but do end up resetting the badge number.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch an app that accepts remote notifications.\r\n2. Set the notification style to Alerts\r\n3. Switch to the Springboard\r\n4. Send a remote notification (developer or production) that has a simple message such as \"Howdie Partner!\" with a badge value of 5\r\n5. See the alert appear, the app to get badged, and that when you tap on the right alert button you get switched to the app\r\n6. switch back to the springboard\r\n7. Send the same notification as before, but set the badge value to zero (0) instead of 5\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe badge value disappears and the alert shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe badge value disappears, but the alert never appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I set the alert style to Banners, I see the banner appear in all cases.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air 2012 but others too\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nResend the alert with the badge at 0. Now it appears. Its just that first one that actually does change the badge number is lost (not shown)."
