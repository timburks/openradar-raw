    description: "Last year, the emoji character set was extended with many useful new symbols. To date, Apple has not yet added these new emoji. Recent updates to iOS (8.3 Beta) and Mac OS X (10.10.3 Beta) include some new emoji (in the form of flags), as well as new shades/tones for people emoji. Diversity of races is a good thing, but where is the diversity for people who wish to communicate with widely recognized hand gestures?\r\n\r\nIn short, while this update showed promise, many including yours truly were deeply disappointed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are no plans to address this.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
