        Summary:
        When adding attributes to a Core Data entity, we enter the attribute name and then need to define the type. The natural way to move between these fields would be to tab to the next column to the right and choose the type, but pressing tab loses focus on the table altogether.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the core data entity editor in Xcode
        2. Add a new attribute to an entity.
        3. Type a name, press tab

        Expected Results:
        The `type` cell is selected.

        Actual Results:
        Focus is lost.
