    description: "Summary:\nWKInterfaceTable has a default spacing between cell, which can’t be changed. UITableView in comparison has a property separatorStyle, which can be used to remove the separator between cells by setting it to ‘UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleNone’. \n\nI´d expect a similar method to be available in WatchKit.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nThere is no way to change the spacing between the cells in WKInterfaceTable.\n\nExpected Results:\nI can change the spacing between cells, by setting the value of the property ‘separatorHeight’\n\nActual Results:\nThere is no way to change the spacing.\n\nRegression:\n\nNotes:"
