        Summary:
        Currently in Xcode, when the file name filtering is active, dragging a file from Finder to the project source list will not allow allow to drop it there. This is really annoying because I often filter to find the correct group to drop a new file to (be it a source code file or some kind of a resource, like an image).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In project sidebar, filter files by name.
        Drag any file from the Finder onto the sidebar.

        Expected Results:
        Itâ€™s possible to drop the file on a group or a file in a group to have it added there.

        Actual Results:
        Dropping is not allowed.
