    description: "Summary:\r\nThe http cookie storage that comes with an ephemeral NSURLSessionConfiguration does not allow the user to store cookies. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create a copy of [NSURLSessionConfiguration ephemeralSessionConfiguration] (let's call this copy 'config').\r\n2. ensure that config.HTTPCookieStorage is not nil (it isn't)\r\n3. verify the config.HTTPCookieStorage.cookies.count == 0\r\n4. create a correct NSHTTPCookie (let's call this 'cookie')\r\n5. store the cookie in the cookie storage: [config.HTTPCookieStorage setCookie:cookie] \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nconfig.HTTPCookieStorage.cookies.count > 0\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nconfig.HTTPCookieStorage.cookies.count == 0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe same applies when actually requesting data from a URL in a session using an ephemeral session configuration, with the response of that request setting a cookie. The cookie will not be present in the session/configuration after the request has successfully completed.\r\n\r\nThe documentation does not mention the fact that ephemeral sessions cannot store cookies. In fact, it mentions: \"For ephemeral sessions, the default value is a private cookie storage object that stores data in memory only, and is destroyed when you invalidate the session.\". This seems not to be the case.\r\n\r\nSetting the values of HTTPShouldSetCookies to YES and/or HTTPCookieAcceptPolicy to NSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyAlways has no effect on this behavior.\r\n\r\nThis was tested both in the simulator as on an iPhone6 running iOS8.1.2.\r\n\r\nIn attachment a project that shows this behavior."
