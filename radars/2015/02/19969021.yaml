        Summary:

        The release notes for Xcode 6.3 beta 2 say that this build can’t install to iOS 8.2, however I’m unable to install to devices running 8.1.3, which is the current stable build at the time of writing.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1.  Attempt to install any app to a device running 8.1.3
        2. Observe it shows up as as “Ineligible Device” in the scheme selector, with no reason given
        3. Open the Devices window
        4. Observe no problems are reported with the device
        5. Restart Xcode
        6. Reconnect iOS device
        7. Reboot iOS device
        8. Reboot Mac
        10. Observe steps 5-10 did not resolve the problem

        Expected Results:

        I would expect even any beta version of Xcode to be able to install apps and run on the latest stable/public version of iOS.

        Actual Results:

        Unable to install or run on iOS 8.1.3

        Regression:

        Xcode 6.1 beta 1 did NOT have this problem.

        Notes:

        Using AppCode, I’m able to install to devices running 8.1.3, using the 6D532l command line tools underneath, suggesting it is perhaps an Xcode UI issue, rather than a system level incompatibility.
