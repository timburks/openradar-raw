    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running a physics simulation in SpriteKit, if you have a node with a physics body and a negative scale, the node will behave unpredictably in the sprite kit scene. In the gif provided, the static physics body at the bottom has a scale of {-1, -1}, and you can observe that the other node passes through it as if it weren't even there. If the scale were changed to {1, 1} they would behave correctly.\r\n\r\nI have seen other behaviours with nodes in this case, such as all dynamic physics bodies being blown out of the scene when there was a {-1, -1} static physics body present, or a dynamic physics body experiencing a giant impulse and flying off the screen when colliding with another physics body whose scale was {-1, -1}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new game project selecting SpriteKit as the technology\r\n2. Open GameScene.m \r\n3. Replace all code in the file with this minimal example:\r\n\r\n@implementation GameScene\r\n\r\n-(void)didMoveToView:(SKView *)view {\r\n    SKSpriteNode *sprite = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@\"Spaceship\"];\r\n\r\n    sprite.xScale = -0.5;\r\n    sprite.yScale = -0.5;\r\n    sprite.position = CGPointMake(500, 250);\r\n    [self addChild:sprite];\r\n    sprite.physicsBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithRectangleOfSize:sprite.size];\r\n    sprite.physicsBody.dynamic = NO;\r\n\r\n    SKSpriteNode *sprite2 = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@\"Spaceship\"];\r\n\r\n    sprite2.xScale = 0.5;\r\n    sprite2.yScale = 0.5;\r\n    sprite2.position = CGPointMake(500, 500);\r\n    [self addChild:sprite2];\r\n    sprite2.physicsBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithRectangleOfSize:sprite2.size];\r\n    sprite2.physicsBody.dynamic = YES;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@end\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect nodes with a negative scale to behave the same as nodes with positive scale, just to be visually reversed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn the gif provided, the static physics body at the bottom has a scale of {-1, -1}, and you can observe that the other node passes through it as if it weren't even there. If the scale were changed to {1, 1} they would behave correctly.\r\n\r\nI have seen other behaviours with nodes in this case, such as all dynamic physics bodies being blown out of the scene when there was a {-1, -1} static physics body present, or a dynamic physics body experiencing a giant impulse and flying off the screen when colliding with another physics body whose scale was {-1, -1}\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode: Version 6.1.1 (6A2008a), iOS: 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlthough the outcome varies, problems occur 100% of the time if the scale is negative."
