    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple Watch component of iOS simulator seems to be registering clicks (touches) at /half/ the coordinate values of where the click actually takes place.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the user clicks in the center of the display, the touch is registered in the top-left quadrant.  Clicking in the bottom-right corner of the display registers a touch *almost* in the middle of the display, but not all the way.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it's impossible to register a touch anywhere outside of the top-left quadrant.  Scroll events from dragging on the view are also limited by this, with items only moving at half the speed the cursor drags them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Apple Watch app with a table view or simply a grid of buttons.  No backing code is necessary, just lay the elements out on the page.\r\n2. Run the Watch app.\r\n3. Click the buttons\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button below the cursor should be passed the touch event, and animate itself to appear \"pushed\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA button somewhere to the upper-left of the cursor gets pushed.  Something is very wrong here.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3 (6D520o) on OS X 10.10.3 (14D72i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm on a MacBook Pro with Retina display, so I assume that this might have to do with the offsets in place for the @2x display.  So with this in mind, I moved the watch simulator's window to a @1x external display, and the problem persisted."
