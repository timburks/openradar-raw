    description: "Summary:\r\nA UILabel will not draw a background color attribute if the following conditions are true:\r\n\r\n1. An NSAttributedString object is created with a single background color attribute\r\n2. The range of the attribute does not begin at location 0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNOTE: I could not attach the example project here on open radar, but it's easy enough to reproduce on your own\r\n\r\n1. Add a UILabel to a UIView and connect it to an outlet in your view controller\r\n2. Construct a single NSAttributedString with a background color attribute and a range that does not start at 0\r\n3. Set the label's attributedText property to your attributed string.\r\n4. Run. You will not see your background color.\r\n\r\nBackground colors ARE rendered when they begin at location 0, and also when there is more than one range in the attributed string.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA UILabel should be able to display a background color, even if there is only one range and that range falls in the middle of the string.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label does not display the highlight in these conditions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nFirst found on original iPad Mini 16 GB Wifi (MF432LL/A), also shows up in iPhone simulator"
