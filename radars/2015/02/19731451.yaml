        Summary:
        When QuickLooking a file in Finder, going back to a previously viewed file shows a blank QuickLook window.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select an image file in the Finder.
        2. QuickLook that image by clicking the spacebar.
        3. Using the arrow keys, select a different image file to QuickLook.
        4. Using the arrow keys, select the original image file.

        Expected Results:
        The original image should be shown, just like it was when it was first QuickLooked.

        Actual Results:
        The original image is blank. It will remain blank until you exit QuickLook and activate it again.
