    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode Bots don't provide any facility for the currently tracked branch to be changed. This can be very frustrating.\r\n\r\nXcode Bots use the (git) branch that was checked out at the time the bot was created. This is not documented anywhere.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Xcode Bot\r\n2. Realize you had the wrong branch checked out when the bot was created\r\n3. Curse and create an entirely new bot just to change branches"
