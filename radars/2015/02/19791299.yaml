    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a button in IB with group contents instead of text, and you check Hidden for the button, not all of the group is hidden.\r\n\r\nI have the following setup:\r\n\r\nWKInterfaceButton\r\n> WKInterfaceGroup\r\n>> WKInterfaceImage\r\n>> WKInterfaceLabel\r\n\r\nWhen I mark the button as Hidden, the WKInterfaceImage is still visible, with the group outline around it, though the table seems to disappear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create interface controller in a storyboard\r\n2. Create the hierarchy described in the Description\r\n3. Mark the button as Hidden\r\n4. Image still remains\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen I mark a button as Hidden, all of its inner contents should be hidden from view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen I mark a button as Hidden, some of its contents remain visible in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 5, OS X Yosemite 10.10.2"
