        Summary:
        OS should support SVG as one of its native image types.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Find an SVG online that you want to use in a presentation. For example, a company logo on Wikipedia. These are well suited for presentations, because they are scalable to any size.
        2. Drag SVG from Safari to Keynote or any other app that uses OS Xâ€™s native image file format support.

        Expected Results:
        SVG renders inline, just like a drag-and-dropped PDF.

        Actual Results:
        Sadness. No native support for SVG in Preview, Keynote, or any other place where images are typically supported.

        Regression:
        none

        Notes:
        You can open the SVG in an app like Acorn, copy, and paste into Keynote, where it will be dropped in as a vector PDF.
