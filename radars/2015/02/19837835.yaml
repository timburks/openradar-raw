    description: "Summary:\r\nI back up my laptop to an external hard disk whenever Time Machine notifies me that too much time has passed between backups.  However, I can no longer perform a back up; each time I try I am told that there is insufficient space.  In settings, it says that \"The oldest backups are deleted when your disk becomes full\".  Those two statements are contradictory; my machine is lying to me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Time Machine to back up to an external hard disk.\r\n2. Plug the disk in whenever prompted, and wait for the backups to finish.\r\n3. After a few months, backups start to fail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe oldest backups should be deleted when the disk becomes full.  That's what it says it's doing, so that's what it should do.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter some time \"preparing the backup\", the following error is displayed:\r\n\r\nTime Machine couldn’t complete the backup to “Time Machine”.\r\n\r\nThe backup disk needs 42.79 GB for the backup but only 11.74 GB are available. Select a larger backup disk or make the backup smaller by excluding files.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012) with 256mb SSD\r\n320gb WD external disc\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's not so much the failure to back up my hard disk that disappoints me - it's the lying that really makes me angry."
