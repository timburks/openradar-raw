    description: "Summary:\r\nUnwind segues called from the master view controller of the standard split view controller arrangement cannot unwind past their own master view controller, even when the same unwind works from a detail VC in the same split.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached UnwindBuglet project. This consists of:\r\n1. A FirstViewController scene with a \"login\" button, and an unwindToFirstViewController() method. When tapped, the login button does a modal segue toâ€¦\r\n2. A UISplitViewController, consisting of:\r\n3. A UINavigationController whose root is a MasterViewController, which is just a UITableViewController subclass. This has two cells, which will be explained in a moment\r\n4. A plain UIViewController for the detail VC\r\n\r\nThe table in 3 has two cells: one is wired to an exit segue to go back to unwindToFirstViewController(), and the other goes to the usual selection handling, which calls performSegueWithIdentifier(\"manualUnwindToFirstViewController\"), which is a manual exit segue.\r\n\r\nThe VC in 4 has a single button to perform an exit segue to unwindToFirstViewController()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll exit segues should unwind back to the first view controller\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the button in the detail VC can unwind to the first VC. The exit segues in cells of the master VC do nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 on Late 2013 MacBook Pro\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UnwindBuglet.zip' was successfully uploaded."
