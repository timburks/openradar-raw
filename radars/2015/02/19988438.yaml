    description: "Summary:\r\nIn longer table views that use estimated row heights, selecting a row to push a new view controller onto a containing navigation controller can recalculate the table view's contentSize, causing a scroll position shift. In some situations, this can scroll the selected cell entirely offscreen, breaking the user's chain of navigation.\r\n\r\nFrom debugging, it appears that the table view leaves and re-enters the window when the default navigation transition begins. UITableView's -didMoveToWindow then recomputes its contentSize based on the estimated row height; if this height times the number of rows is significantly different from the actual total height of the rows in question, the scroll position jumps by the difference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the attached sample app on an iPhone in portrait.\r\n2. Scroll all the way down.\r\n3. Select the last row.\r\n4. Navigate back.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe last row is still entirely visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe last row has been scrolled partially (or entirely) offscreen.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nSample app for this radar available at https://github.com/lithium3141/TableViewNavigationContentJump"
