    description: "Summary:\r\nI erased my iPhone. Apple told AmEx to delete my Apple Pay registration, but did not tell me. Neither Apple nor AmEx knew what was going on when I asked. It is reasonable for Apple to deregister/not restore Apple Pay enrollment, but not to actively contact my CC issuer without informing me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Register AmEx with Apple Pay on iPhone 6.\r\n2. Settings: Erase All Content and Settings.\r\n3. Restore via iTunes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected my Apple Pay registration (which I have not used recently) to still be active and available after restore.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy Apple Pay registration was not restored.\r\nApple instructed AmEx to delete my Apple Pay registration.\r\nAmEx sent me a poorly worded mail (which looked like spam and was filtered to my Junk folder), notifying me that they had deleted my Apple Pay registration.\r\nWhen I called AmEx the first two reps were unaware that they had deleted my Apple Pay registration and did not believe they AmEx sent the email. None of the 5 people I spoke to knew AmEx sent the email or why.\r\nA couple days later I got a call back, informing me that Apple had instructed them to deregister my card.\r\nWhen I called Apple neither rep knew what had happened, but one did learn that this is procedure after Erase All Content and Settings.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApple should not contact my credit card issuer without notifying me. If you think the iPhone has been lost or stolen and Apple Pay cannot be securely restored, I need to know.\r\nNeither AmEx nor Apple reps know about this procedure. I spoke to 7 people, and none of them initially understood what had happened or why.\r\nAmEx needs to update and document their procedures and train their reps so they know what is going on.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNothing unusual -- American Express card registered with Apple Pay on iPhone 6."
