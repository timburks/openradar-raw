        Summary:
        Some browsers report SSL warnings, and all log errors, reporting that the /xcode page is attempting to load some contents over HTTPS (full message: “Mixed Content: The page at 'https://{serverurl}/xcode' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://{serverurl}:20399/socket.io/1/?t=1424375032171'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.”)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Turn on Xcode Server
        2. Add an SSL certificate
        3. Configure at least 1 Xcode bot
        4. Load your Xcode server web page (https://{serverurl}/xcode

        Expected Results:
        All browsers show an all-green SSL indicator, and no errors are logged to the console

        Actual Results:
        Some browsers (and/or some security settings) show a yellow warning triangle over the SSL indicator, and all of them show the error message noted above in the javascript console
