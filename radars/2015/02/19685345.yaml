        Consider an app that has a shutter button to trigger video recording, shutter button emits a sound when starting / stopping.
        This sound should be silenced when the silent ring is set to silent.

        The only AVAudioSession that can handle simultaneous playback and recording is PlayAndRecord. However, this category does not honor the silence ring (will alway playback audio). Moreover, there is no API to determine if device is silenced (so that we could skip the sound ourselves). Hence, shutter sound will always play, even when device is silent. An alternative is to remove all start/stop sound from video recording apps, like Instagram does. But this is not a good UX. Apple's own camera app correctly handles that situation, possibly using private APIs.

        Please consider providing an API that allows this *basic* behavior. Thanks.
