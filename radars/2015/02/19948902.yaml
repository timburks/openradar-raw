    description: The window.find method in Javascript is no longer finding strings outside the current contenteditable div.  In our application, we have multiple contenteditable div elements and the user can navigate to place holders in the fields.  The method can find search strings if the element is not a contenteditable div.  This stopped working with iOS 8.
