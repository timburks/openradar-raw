    description: "Summary:\r\nLet’s say you’re driving and listening to a podcast. You have driving directions active on your current trip. The podcast host starts talking about a trip from city A to city B, and you want to know how long that is. You ask Siri. Now you’re getting *directions* from city A to city B, overwriting your current trip.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start directions on your iPhone and start traveling along the route.\r\n2. Activate Siri and ask, “How long is the drive from Albuquerque to Portland?”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri will tell you about how long that drive would be, and your directions will still be going.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Maps app opens with directions from Albuquerque to Portland, and your current route is gone into the ether.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus AT&T 64GB (MGAU2LL/A)"
