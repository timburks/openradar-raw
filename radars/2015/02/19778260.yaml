        Summary:
        Our build server uses xcodebuild with a CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR flag. When we switched from `xcodebuild build` to `xcodebuild archive`, we noticed that the dSYMs folder in the newly-generated archive was empty. Turns out this happens whenever CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR is defined.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. `xcodebuild clean archive -scheme “valid-scheme-name”  -archivePath /tmp/sparky-1.xcarchive CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/sparky-1`
        2. `xcodebuild clean archive -scheme “valid-scheme-name”  -archivePath /tmp/sparky-2.xcarchive`

        Expected Results:
        Both sparky-1.xcarchive and sparky-2.xcarchive should contain a dsym.

        Actual Results:
        The dSYMs folder in sparky-1.xcarchive is empty, and the dSYM is inside /tmp/sparky-1/ instead. This is unexpected.
