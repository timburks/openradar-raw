    description: "Summary:\r\nChanging the build in a prerelease version of the app causes the text submission box in the Resolution Center to disappear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Get an app rejection\r\n2) Review information in Resolution Center\r\n3) Upload a new build\r\n4) Set the build in the prerelease metadata\r\n5) Go to Resolution Center to explain your changes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to let the app reviewer know what you did to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text input box in the Resolution Center is gone.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPreviously, the text box was available until the app was submitted for review.\r\n\r\n----\r\nEngineering has requested the following:\r\n\r\nAfter uploading the new build you should submit the app again for review.\r\n----\r\n\r\nI know how build submission works: I've been developing apps since the day the App Store opened.\r\n\r\nThe point of this bug report was to let you know that there's a problem with the Resolution Center after you upload a build. When you upload a build because of a rejection, you lose the ability to respond to the app reviewer who rejected the previous build. This breaks an important communication channel between developers and reviewers."
