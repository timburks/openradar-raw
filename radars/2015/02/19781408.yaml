    description: "It would be very nice to be able to use multiple storyboards when creating WatchKit apps. It is difficult to work in a single storyboard for an entire project with a large team. Merging diffs can get quite challenging on storyboard files. By allowing us to use multiple storyboards, we can compartmentalize the interfaces and allow more users to work on storyboards simultaneously without having to have colliding diffs.\r\n\r\n======== UPDATE =========\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed in the latest Xcode 7 beta."
