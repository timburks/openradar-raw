        Summary:
        Mail.app is unable to authenticate to any mail account

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Yosemite 10.10.2
        Try to create an IMAP account hosted on OS X Server 10.6.8.
        Enter credentials as needed, including a password.

        Expected Results:
        Mail.app should be able to correctly authenticate against dovecot on OS X Server using CRAM-MD5, LOGIN or PLAIN mechanism.

        Actual Results:
        Mail.app is absolutely unable to correctly authenticate in any way.

        Server log:
        Feb 10 19:58:47 mail dovecot[67]: imap-login: Login: user=<username>, method=CRAM-MD5, rip=89.144.232.216, lip=10.11.2.12, TLS

        Client session log also shows that Mail.app sends incorrect AUTH data and then disconnects again.

        I've tried with passwords of 15 or 63 characters and anything in between. I tried to eliminate special characters (which work for network login though). Nothing makes any difference for Mail.app. It refuses to correctly login through IMAP or Submission in any case.

        Mavericks can authenticate against the same server. Disregarding that Mail.app crashes due to a known to Apple bug which Apple has already confirmed exists since 10.9.0 and will not be fixed anymore.



        Regression:
        Mail.app was able to auth in 10.10.1. It was still absolutely unusable due to crashes, hangs, freezes, etc.
        Unexpectedly, Mail.app 8.2 has become even worse.



        Notes:
        These ongoing problems with Apple's software quality has led us to remove Apple from our buying decisions. The absolutely unusable state that Yosemite is in is not acceptable for business or anyone else in fact. This system is actually even worse than Leopard which was really horrible.
