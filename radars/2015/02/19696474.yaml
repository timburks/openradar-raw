    description: "Summary:\nAs WKInterfaceTable row objects are subclasses of NSObject, they do not have an “awakeFromNib” which would give them an opportunity to update properties of their IBOutlet subviews (as one would with say a UITableViewCell). Attempts to change properties of their IBOutlet subviews inside of init, for example, fail silently. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- In your storyboard, create a WKInterfaceTable with a row object that is a subclass of NSObject\n- Add a button to the row object as a subview\n- Inside the init method of the class that represents the row object, attempt to set the button’s title.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe button’s title would be shown.\n\nActual Results:\nSetting the button’s title silently fails.\n\nNotes:\nPerhaps one way to solve this would be to provide an explicit WKInterfaceTableCell class, which had an awakeFromNib-like method in which these changes can be made."
