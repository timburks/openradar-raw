    description: "In Objective-C based projects, it is possible to connect a View Controller's Xib to the Storyboard by removing the View object from the Storyboard's representation of the View Controller. This works, presumably in conjunction with initWithNibName:bundle:'s default behavior, providing a Xib file of the same name as the class for the specific View Controller. It appears that this default behavior is not the same when using Swift. \r\n\r\nTwo sample projects, one with Objective-C and the other with Swift, can be viewed here: https://github.com/jnjosh/RadarSamples/tree/master/StoryboardXib. The behavior consistently works in the Objective-C based project and doesn't in the Swift-based project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new Project with Storyboard with Swift\r\n2. Create `SampleViewController` (subclass of UIViewController) and check the option to create Xib of same name.\r\n3. In the Storyboard add a new View Controller as the Initial View controller.\r\n4. Delete the View object in the View Controller's representation.\r\n5. Change the class of the View Controller to `SampleViewController`\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen launching the app, the View should be sourced from the Xib file as there is no view in the Storyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo view is loaded from the Xib file."
