    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen beginning the swipe-to-delete gesture on a table view cell, but then aborting it before it snaps into its final position (fully revealing the \"Delete\" button), the table view is still in editing mode afterwards. Edit mode is only left after tapping the table view again (anywhere).\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run attached example project\r\n2. Slightly begin to swipe any cell\r\n3. Before it snaps into its final state revealing the \"Delete\" button, release it so that the button disappears again\r\n4. Observe the text on the cell and the state of the \"Edit/Done\" bar button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- self.tableView.editing set back to NO\r\n- [cell setEditing:NO animated:YES] is called\r\n- the edit bar button item is set back to \"Edit\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- self.tableView.editing is still YES\r\n- -setEditing:animated: is not called on the cell\r\n- the edit bar button item is still showing \"Done\"\r\n\r\nOnly tapping the table view again causes the editing mode to be reset to NO.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to be a regression introduced in iOS8. Works as expected on iOS7.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device or simulator"
