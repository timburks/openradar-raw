    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode sometimes crashes when I run the app that I'm making in iOS simulator with enabled breakpoints of debugger.\r\nWhen it is happened, I have to recompile the main code of the app that is not sub projects of the app.\r\nIt is usually solved by the recompiling, but it rarely cannot be solved by it. I have to clean project, Delete Provisioning Profiles, and Code signing Identities.\r\nAccording to the Crash logs, the problem is related Code Signing even though iOS Simulator does not need to be signed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make main projects of the iOS app.\r\n2. Make sub projects which generates libraries.\r\n3. Add the sub projects to the main projects.\r\n4. Edit only codes belongs sub projects and run in iOS Simulator with debugger for a while.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuppose launch in iOS Simulator with debugger without crash. \r\nThe crash logs is below.\r\n\r\nCrashed Thread:        30  <DBGLLDBSessionThread (pid=32618)>\r\n\r\nException Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (Code Signature Invalid)\r\nException Codes:       0x0000000000000032, 0x000000012e92d000\r\n\r\nkernel messages:\r\n-1 sec           \tCODE SIGNING: cs_invalid_page(0x12e92d000): p=29181[Xcode] final status 0x3004200, denying page sending SIGKILL\r\n-1 sec           \tCODE SIGNING: process 29181[Xcode]: rejecting invalid page at address 0x12e92d000 from offset 0x2108000 in file \"/Documents/*/APP_NAME.app/APP_NAME\" (cs_mtime:1424463075.0 == mtime:1424463075.0) (signed:1 validated:1 tainted:1 wpmapped:0 slid:0)\r\n\r\nVM Regions Near 0x12e92d000:\r\n    mapped file            000000012c3e1000-000000012c825000 [ 4368K] r--/rwx SM=COW  /Documents/*/*.pch\r\n--> mapped file            000000012c825000-000000012f119000 [ 41.0M] r--/rwx SM=COW  /Documents/*/APP_NAME.app/APP_NAME\r\n    mapped file            000000012f119000-0000000132208000 [ 48.9M] r--/rwx SM=COW  /Documents/*\r\n\r\n\r\nThread 30 Crashed:: <DBGLLDBSessionThread (pid=32618)>\r\n0   com.apple.LLDB.framework      \t0x000000011202c7a6 lldb_private::DataExtractor::GetMaxU64_unchecked(unsigned long long*, unsigned long) const + 114\r\n1   com.apple.LLDB.framework      \t0x00000001121312e3 ObjectFileMachO::ParseSymtab() + 3709\r\n2   com.apple.LLDB.framework      \t0x00000001121303d2 ObjectFileMachO::GetSymtab() + 158\r\n3   com.apple.LLDB.framework      \t0x00000001121d52f8 lldb_private::SymbolVendor::GetSymtab() + 64\r\n4   com.apple.LLDB.framework      \t0x000000011207026f lldb_private::Module::ResolveSymbolContextForAddress(lldb_private::Address const&, unsigned int, \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode is crashed even though iOS simulator is ran my app.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 on Yosemite 10.10.2.\r\n\r\nIt was never happened when I was using Xcode 5 on Mavericks.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt is started to crash when I upgrade to Yosemite with Xcode 6.\r\nIt was never happened when I was using Xcode 5 on Mavericks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
