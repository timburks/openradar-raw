        Summary:
        In Messages.app on iPhone, if you are listening to audio and press the “quick capture” button (the little camera above the keyboard) the audio ducks out - which makes sense, because the video capture is taking over. However, once the quick capture is done, audio playback should resume.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Play a podcast or song on your iPhone.
        2. Open Messages.app, go to a conversation, and press-and-hold on the camera to enter “quick capture” mode.
        3. Take a photo.

        Expected Results:
        The photo is immediately sent to the conversation, and audio playback resumes.

        Actual Results:
        The photo is immediately sent to the conversation, but audio playback does not resume.
