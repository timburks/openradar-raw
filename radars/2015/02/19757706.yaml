    description: "Summary:\r\nA trivial implementation of a linked list compiles but cannot runs\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCompile attached code, and run. Or run with the swift command line program.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code should execute and complete or the Swift compiler should complain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe code hangs on initializing a List\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf the List struct is defined with a boxed value, the code compiles and runs well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a short source file exhibiting the problem. It includes a commented redefinition of a List that does not exhibit the problem."
