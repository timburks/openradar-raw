    description: "Summary:\r\nAs seen on the screenshot (https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkryb705u2rqt4l/itctf.png?dl=0) the latest build in one case is showing a version number from another app in my account. This is not a fatal issues but it's pretty misleading and might irritate if you want to check which beta has been the latest installed by this specific person.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInvite same tester to two different Apps using Testflight external beta testing. Activate beta test for two apps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe row for the specific tester shows the currently beta tested version of the currently selected app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe row for the specific tester shows a random version number of any other app the specific tester is currently testing from this one vendor.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.x, iOS 7.x"
