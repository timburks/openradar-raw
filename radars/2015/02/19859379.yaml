        Summary:

        See attached screencast. In the “new external beta testers” form/table, hitting shift-tab doesn’t always go backwards.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Start adding new beta testers. Hit tab to go from field to field, then shift-tab to go in reverse.

        Expected Results:

        Tabbing should go forward, shift-tabbing should go backwards.

        Actual Results:

        Shift-tabbing loops between the same two fields.

        Regression:
        -
