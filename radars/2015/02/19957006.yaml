        Summary:
        If many people will be giving presentations one after the other, it would be useful to play them one after the other, without having to leave slideshow mode to open and play the next slides.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Organize some lightning talks with others in your company.
        2. Invite all your friends.
        3. Ask for everyone’s Keynote slides to load onto the demo computer.
        4. Attempt to play the slideshows one after the other, with as little interruption as possible.

        Expected Results:
        Keynote has some mechanism to create a “playlist” of .key files, which will be presented one after the other with no interruption (or perhaps a black screen, or some kind of “mail merge”-type template with the next presenter’s name) in between each one.

        Actual Results:
        Keynote has no such facility. You have to leave presentation mode, find and/or open the next slideshow, and re-enter presentation mode, which interrupts the flow of several presentations back to back.

        Regression:
        I regret that this is not a feature that exists.

        Notes:
        You could apparently do it with Automator, but ain’t nobody got time for that.
