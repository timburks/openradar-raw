    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are 2 scenarios (in all cases canPerformEditOperation(.Delete) indicates the asset[s] ARE deletable):\r\n1.) Perform deleteAssets change request on asset that is NOT the representative photo from a burst sequence -> nothing is deleted\r\n2.) Perform deleteAssets change request on asset that is the representative photo from a burst sequence -> entire burst is deleted\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Call PHAssets.fetchAssetsWithOptions with includeAllBurstAssets enabled\r\n2.) Call PHPhotoLibrary.sharedPhotoLibrary().performChanges({PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets(...) ... on asset(s) in a burst such that none of the assets are the representative photo.\r\n3.) Call PHPhotoLibrary.sharedPhotoLibrary().performChanges({PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets(...) ... on the representative photo (representsBurst == true) of a burst. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen non-representative photo is deleted, it should be removed from the burst.\r\nWhen representative photo is deleted, it and it alone should be removed from the burst. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen non-representative photo is deleted, no photos are removed from the burst.\r\nWhen representative photo is deleted, the entire burst is deleted. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThings get more complicated when you use the \"Select...\" feature in Photos.app on a burst sequence so that they show up as individual photos in Photos.app. Then you CAN delete them from the photo grid but they are still not removed from the burst."
