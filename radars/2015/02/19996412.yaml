        Summary:
        Every time an opened .xcodeproj file changes on the file system (usually because of pulling remote changes with an SCM via command line or a 3rd party tool), the Project Navigator state is reset and all items get collapsed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Open a versioned .xcodeproj file with Xcode
        2) expand some items in the Project Navigator
        3) pull in changes to the .xcodeproj file via an SCM, e.g git

        Expected Results:
        Previously expanded items are still expanded and the selected file is still selected

        Actual Results:
        All previously expanded items get collapsed

        Regression:
        Donâ€™t think this ever worked
