        Summary:
        When scrolling through suggested faces, you may find one that you want to ignore that is in the middle of the scroll window. When you ignore it, the scroll window scrolls all the way back to the beginning causing you to have to scroll back to where you were.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a photo library with enough suggested faces where you have to scroll.
        2. Scroll somewhere down the line.
        3. Ignore a face.
        4. Get taken back to the beginning


        Expected Results:
        1. Have a photo library with enough suggested faces where you have to scroll.
        2. Scroll somewhere down the line.
        3. Ignore a face.
        4. Stay where you were with the face disappearing.

        Actual Results:
        1. Have a photo library with enough suggested faces where you have to scroll.
        2. Scroll somewhere down the line.
        3. Ignore a face.
        4. Get taken back to the beginning
