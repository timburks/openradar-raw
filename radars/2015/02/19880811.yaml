    description: "Summary:\r\nThis typically occurs when you have a fixed elements on the screen and the user focuses on the input element. The fixed element jumps to the middle of the screen or outside the screen.\r\nA workaround this bug is to use absolute position and set the position appropriately or resorting to JavaScript to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAssuming you have a fixed element (preferably a fixed header) and an input element (preferably a text field) on the page, \r\nScroll somewhere on the page, ensuring that the fixed element (header) follows you.\r\nClick on the input element (textbox) and notice the virtual keyboard slide on to the screen and the fixed element (header) changing its position accordingly.\r\nNow while scrolling, fixed element (header) has changed is position due to the keyboard, and you can see the header hanging in between the screen or out of the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFixed element doesn't move. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'nav-bar.png' and 'nav-test.html' were successfully uploaded."
