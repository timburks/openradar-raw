    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached project causes Xcode to crash when printing a value in the debugger. The trigger appears to be linking against a library, in this case Crashlytics/Fabric. This library provides a modulemap for compatibility with Swift, which could be a factor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open included xcode project\r\n2. Set a breakpoint in application(:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)\r\n3. `po self`when the debugger pauses\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA description of `self` is printed to the console\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes completely\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis did not happen in Xcode 6.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn this example project, the crash only occurs when the deployment target is a version of iOS 8. However, the project I originally encountered this issue with targets 7.1. I am not sure what difference causes that project to crash but not this one when targeting iOS 7."
