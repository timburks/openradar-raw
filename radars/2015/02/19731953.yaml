    description: "Summary:\n\nPhotos on iCloud.com hangs on \"Preparing your library…”. \n\nI previously had iCloud Photo Library (Beta) turned on on my device running iOS 8.1.3, but I had various issues that prevented synchronizing (see radar 18720683 for example). I turned off iCloud Photo Library on my iOS devices in order to try to reset things so maybe it would work again, and now I’m in the state described above.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nVisit iCloud.com, tap on “Photos”.\n\nExpected Results:\nI see my library, or an informative error message.\n\nActual Results:\nI see “Preparing your library…”, and have seen this message for several days now."
