    description: "Summary:\r\nKext signing requirements of Mavericks and Yosemite require users to enable kext-dev-mode in order to install unsigned kexts. While a reasonable requirement for kernel extension developers, end-users receiving a driver from a trusted source should not be required to completely disable system kext signing checks merely for a single extension.\r\n\r\nA more convenient approach would be to allow users to install (with appropriate privileges) one-off kexts. This would facilitate the installation of self-signed kernel extensions without requiring kext-dev-mode be enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. sudo kextload osx-pl2303.kext\r\n2. observer kext not loaded\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nkextload should allow for unsigned drivers to be loaded (with appropriate warnings, of course).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nkexts that are not signed by an Apple-provided certificate are not loadable on Yosemite without kext-dev-mode. It appears that these certificates are only provided to hardware manufacturers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1"
