    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a Today widget has no content to display, the widget or its parent app should be able to call [[NCWidgetController widgetController] setHasContent:forWidgetWithBundleIdentifier:]. When set to NO, the widget should hide, then when the parent app sets it to YES, the widget should appear again. This works great on iOS and given the limited space in Notification Center, many users appreciate the feature. On OS X I have never been able to get the feature to work. Any time I try to call this method in a sandboxed app, I get the error \"Could not connect to Notification Center to set hasContent\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and install the attached sample app.\r\n2. Run the app.\r\n3. Install its Today widget.\r\n4. Quit and relaunch the app to give it one more chance. As soon as the app launches, it attempts to hide the widget with [[NCWidgetController widgetController] setHasContent:YES forWidgetWithBundleIdentifier:@\"com.junecloud.HasContent.HasContentToday\"];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Today widget should hide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app fails to hide the widget. Some errors are logged:\r\n2/2/15 1:07:17.001 PM HasContent[50372]: Could not connect to Notification Center to set hasContent\r\n2/2/15 1:07:17.008 PM sandboxd[333]: ([50372]) HasContent(50372) deny mach-lookup com.apple.notificationcenterui.widgetcontent\r\n\r\nThe full sandboxd report is attached.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109), Xcode 6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only workaround I've been able to find is to disable sandboxing. With an App Store app this is not even an option."
