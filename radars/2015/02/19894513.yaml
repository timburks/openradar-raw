    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting an interface controller modally, it uses white text instead of the globally-defined tint color in your storyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create two interface controller in your WatchKit app storyboards; one is the initial interface controller, one is a modal view controller. Give them both titles.\r\n2. Set the global tint color in your storyboard to something other than white.\r\n3. Present the modal interface controller from the initial interface controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe modal interface controller’s title will be drawn in the tint color defined in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe modal interface controller’s title is white.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C121)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI read that this is expected behavior on the dev forums (https://devforums.apple.com/message/1104737#1104737) but have gotten requests from our designer to change the color of that interface controller.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator"
