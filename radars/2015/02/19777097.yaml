        Summary:
        Provisioning profile names represent both spaces and underscores as underscores. When trying to figure out a profile name to specify to `xcodebuild -exportProvisioningProfile`, you have to know whether each underscore was originally a space or an underscore. If you get it wrong, xcodebuild will insist, all evidence to the contrary, “no provisioning profile matches”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Name a profile “Whizbang Adhoc Profile”
        2. Name another profile “Whizbang_Appstore_Profile”
        3. Give both profiles to a build engineer trying to automate the export of an Xcode archive to a signed app.

        Expected Results:
        Build engineer completes task without tearing hair out.

        Actual Results:
        It’s tricky enough to glean that Xcode expects to be given the original name of the profile as given to the dev portal, sans “.mobileprovision”. It’s a cruel twist of the knife that even someone who knows this, and is looking at a profile whose filename contains underscores, still doesn’t know for sure how to describe that profile to xcodebuild.

        Notes:
        It would be lovely if we could just specify the profile by filename, or even by path, rather than requiring it to exist under “~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/”.
