    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a new style .xib (created with Xcode 5) uses a Text View, with Smart Quotes turned off, Mavericks erroneously reads it as turned on.\r\n\r\n.xib files created with older versions of Xcode do not seem to be affected, nor do older versions of Mac OS X using the Xcode 5 created .xib.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing Mavericks and Xcode 5, create a new Cocoa Application project.\r\nAdd a TextView to the window.\r\nTurn off Smart Quotes (and Smart Dashes)\r\nRun\r\nQuotes are substituted despite the setting.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmart Quotes setting to be honoured.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nQuotes are substituted despite the Smart Quotes setting.  The only way to turn it off is to manually call SetAutomaticQuoteSubstitutionEnabled:NO\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode Version 5.0.1 (5A2053)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TextAutomaticQuoteSubstitutionEnabled.zip' was successfully uploaded."
