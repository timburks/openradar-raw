    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari has a Bug that makes it impossible to play Audio or Video Streams (i.e. Icecast/Shoutcast Streams) that require HTTP Basic Auth.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enter the URL of an Audio or Video Stream that require HTTP Basic Auth in the Safari Address Bar and hit enter\r\n2. A dialog pops-up asking for the required Username and Password, enter the (right) credentials and hit OK\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari should play the stream as expected, as the needed Auth data was given.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari will not play the stream and just show a play button that does nothing when tapped.\r\n\r\nSafari will make four request to the media stream, the first, obviously without any Authorization header set. The server responds with Status Code 401, indicating that authentication is required. Safari asks the User for the credentials and makes another request, which contains the right Authentication header. Safari cancels this request for some unknown reason and makes another one, without an Authorization header, which fails as the server sends error Code 401 due to the missing Auth details. Safari then makes another request without Authorization headers which fails too.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari on iOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
