    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using multi-page layouts, table rows get squished when setting label text in awakeWithContext. If it is set in willActivate, the layout works properly. This is only the behavior when using multiple interface controllers in a paged layout. If you only use a single interface controller with a table, it works properly to set up the table in awakeWithContext.\r\n\r\nI have created a sample project that reproduces the issue consistently. I have also attached a screenshot of the squished rows on the second paged interface controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe rows would not be squished and the label would display the text that was applied to it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label text is empty and the rows are squished.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Squished.zip' and 'Squished_Rows_ScreenShot.png' were successfully uploaded."
