    description: "Summary:\r\nQuite frequently, though not always, Xcode's \"Add Items\" panel repeatdly collapses the outline view representing the available items, such that searching for and selecting an item is difficult to carry out in a streamlined fashion.\r\n\r\nSee that attached movie for an example of attempts to add an item being thwarted by Xcode's insistence that the root item in the outline view should be collapsed after every single edit in the search field."
