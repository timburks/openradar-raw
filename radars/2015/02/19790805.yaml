    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile attempting to track down another issue in a playground, I ran into the following error:\r\n\r\nUnable to find suitable target device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Fire up version of Xcode 6.3 beta specified in version string.\r\n2. Open attached playground file.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayground should allow me to continue adding code without error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGet the error indicated in the summary screen.  Subsequent attempts to edit the code produce the same result.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIssue does not occur in Version 6.1.1 (6A2008a).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFound this while looking for other examples of running into a segmentation fault 11 build error with the new version of Xcode.  The code causing the problem turns out to be an extension as well, only this time with an extension of UIApplication.  When I saw this code posted in the devforums at the following thread:\r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/1101519#1101519\r\n\r\nI attempted to reproduce the error and get this result instead."
