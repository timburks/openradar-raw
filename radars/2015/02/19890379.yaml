    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building an iOS app today Xcode complained that capabilities listed in the entitlements file might not work because no provisioning profiles matched the bundle identifier.\r\n\r\nThis was puzzling since the app built without warnings (and with capabilities listed in the entitlements file obviously working) as recently as yesterday.\r\n\r\nBut no, said Xcode, no such provisioning profile can be found in all the land of the kingdom, nor in the misty lands beyond.\r\n\r\nSo I opened Xcode's preferences to the accounts tab, and, lo! There was no such provisioning profile! Had some knave stolen away with it while I slept?\r\n\r\nI visited the developer site and looked up my provisioning profiles. Saints be praised, the profile still existed! But Xcode was unable to find it.\r\n\r\nI clicked Xcode's \"reload\" button in the accounts preferences. Xcode thought very long and presumably very hard. It tried to distract me with trivialities about nonexistent OS X certificates.\r\n\r\nAfter a long while Xcode eventually located the provisioning profile, and there was much rejoicing across the land.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Today I fixed three build warnings by telling Xcode to reload information it had yesterday, and then waiting a really long time.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to but not the same as rdar://19870347\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Design an app that requires capabilities to be listed in its entitlements file.\r\n2. Ensure that provisioning profiles are in place to permit these capabilities.\r\n3. Build and run\r\n4. Wait until the next day and then repeat step 3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnless something in the scheme had expired, the app would continue to build without warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDespite there being no expirations or manual intervention in the signing and provisioning process or configuration, Xcode nevertheless lost track of the provisioning profile and produced builds which could no longer use the capabilities described in the entitlements.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3 (6D520o)\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot attached of Xcode's incorrect error messages."
