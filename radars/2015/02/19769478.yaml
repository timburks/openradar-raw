    description: "Summary:\r\nThe amount of padding above and below text in Notification Center's Today Edit screen changes when adding and removing elements from each section when Larger Text has been enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Larger Accessibility Sizes under General -> Accessibility -> Larger Text\r\n2. Increase the slider to two notches left of centre (fifth from right)\r\n3. Open Notification Center\r\n4. Change to the Today view if not on it.\r\n5. Tap Edit at the bottom\r\n6. Note that there's quite a lot of padding above and below each label.\r\n7. Press - on an active widget or + on an inactive one.\r\n8. Note that the amount of padding above and below most labels is significantly reduced, but some remain with lots of padding.\r\n9. Scroll to the top and the larger padding returns."
