    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen receiving a voice message, the receiver can raise the phone to their ear to listen to it, which is great when you're in a public place and can't play the message outloud. However, Raising to Listen often doesn't work. When I raise my iPhone 6 to my ear, I often see that the display doesn't even go dark when it's against my head, and sometimes my ear will hit the back button, taking me to my list of threads. I then need to go back into the thread and try to raise the phone again.\r\n\r\nI've tried locking and unlocking the phone as well as rebooting, but nothing can consistently make the phone play my message when I raise it. It's s complete guessing game as to when this will actually work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a voice message\r\n2. Open Messages.app\r\n3. Open thread that voice message is in\r\n4. Raise phone to your ear to play the voice message. Often, it won't play, and the screen won't even go dark.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen I raise the phone to my ear, the display should always go dark, and my voice message should immediately start playing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOften, the voice message does not play, and my screen doesn't even go dark. My ear will often hit the Back button as well, taking me back to my list of threads.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB Verizon, using Wi-Fi"
