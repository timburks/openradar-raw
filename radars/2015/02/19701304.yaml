    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using WebViews hosted within an NSTabView your documentation recommends to use the setHostWindow: API of the WebView class. This works work around the issue that \"Plug-ins and JavaScript depend on a window to function properly even if the web view is not in an actual window\".\r\n\r\nHowever, when using this API and switching back and forth between the tabs, the Plugin's contents suddenly flip vertically and horizontally.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Start the x64 based sample of the attached project.\r\n- Switch from the 'No Plugin' tab to the 'Quick Time' tab (or 'Flash' if installed and configured properly).\r\n- At this stage everything is working as expected.\r\n- Now switch back to the 'No Plugin' tab and once again back to the 'Quick Time' tab.\r\n- Now the Quick Time logo on the right is flipped vertically and horizontally. (see screenshots)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo flipping of a Plugin contained in a WebView.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlugins appear flipped in the WebView.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\nOS X Version 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample for this issue is also hosted on Github: https://github.com/lemonmojo/WebViewPluginTest\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nFor me, this is reproducible with the following systems/configurations:\r\nOS X 10.10.2 with Safari 8.0.3 (10600.3.18)\r\nOS X 10.9.5 with Safari 7.1.3 (9537.85.12.18)\r\nOS X 10.9.5 with Safari 7.1.2 (9537.85.11.5)\r\n\r\nI can NOT reproduce it with the following systems/configurations:\r\nOS X 10.8.5 with Safari 6.2.3 (8537.85.12.18)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it's only reproducible if the application is targeting the 64 bit architecture. For this reason there are two targets included in the sample project, one targeting 32 bit (WebViewPluginTest x86) and one targeting 64 bit (WebViewPluginTest x64).\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WebViewPluginTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
