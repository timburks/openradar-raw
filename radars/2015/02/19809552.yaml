        Summary:
        When I follow the Submit to App Store flow to test an app with Testflight in Xcode 6.3 (6D520o) the upload fails saying “Transporter not found at path”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Archive an app.
        2. In the organizer, hit Submit to App Store.
        3. Wait for it to process your app for upload.
        4. The process fails with an error.

        Expected Results:
        Upload successful

        Actual Results:
        Failure with error message.

        “Archive submission failed due to the issues listed below.
        Transporter not found at path: /usr/local/itms/bin/iTMSTransporter. You should reinstall the application.”

        Regression:
        This has been working on in Xcode 6.1 on my machine.

        Notes:
        The folder /usr/local/itms does not exist on my filesystem. I believe Transporter is part of the Xcode bundle, but Xcode isn’t looking for it there for some reason.
