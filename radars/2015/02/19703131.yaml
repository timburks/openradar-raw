    description: "Summary:\r\nAVAsset’s isPlayable method returns NO for certain audio files which play fine through AVPlayer.  In particular extended AACs suffer from this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an AVAsset with an extended AAC (grab one from the AAC feed here http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/features/mac_geek_gab_free/) \r\n2. Check `isPlayable`\r\n3. Try playing it anyway.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. `isPlayable` should return YES\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. `isPlayable` returns NO, but the file is in fact playable\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA work around is to also check `asset.tracks.count == 0` to confirm that the asset is not playable, but that is probably letting through some assets that have a track that we can’t play.\r\n\r\nAn example project is attached which demonstrates this issue reliably."
