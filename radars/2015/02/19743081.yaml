    description: "Summary:\r\nOur current image processing application, we would like to be able to do the following\r\n- On devices that support it (iPhone 5s / 6 / 6+), use a AVCaptureSession to capture high framerate (>= 120fps) CMSampleBuffer from the rear camera\r\n- Process those frames at native (high) framerate in RAM and/or encode them to a video file on disk\r\n- Display a feedback of the original video from the capture session to the user *at 30fps* using an AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer\r\n\r\nRationale:  videos > 30fps produce an unpleasant visual effect when played in 1x. While we recognise the value of having more frames for video processing and slo-mo playback, having the preview run at at least 60fps does not have any benefit but instead introduce unpleasant visual effects.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer class documentation\r\n2. Note that there is no way of limiting the displayed framerate of the preview to 30fps\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be such a way. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTo this day there is no way of limiting the framerate of the preview, which, since 240 and 120 are divided by 30, could be a simple drop frames (display 1 frame, drop the next 3, display 1 frame, etc.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions prior to iOS 8.1 (included)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 6, 6+"
