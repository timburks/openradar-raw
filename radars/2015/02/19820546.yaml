    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://14236279\r\n\r\nIf a custom font is used in an attributed string on a UILabel configured via Interface Builder, the label displays using the default font when the application is run. This is misleading, as the custom font is shown in interface builder itself.\r\n\r\nThis issue is present in all versions of Xcode 6, including 6.3 Beta 1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add a custom font to an iOS project\r\n2) Create a UILabel in interface builder, and configure its text to be “Attributed”\r\n3) Set the custom font added to the project as the font of the attributed string\r\n4) Build and run\r\n\r\nThe label appears in the simulator without the custom font. This issue only applies to attributed strings.\r\n\r\nThe attached project includes a view with three labels, the first of which exhibits this issue."
