    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm finally getting around to formally filing this as a bug, but I have essentially never been able to use the \"Filter\" mechanism because it is so slow when dealing with the number of items in my typical project workspaces.\r\n\r\nMy source base is reasonably large, but surely can't compare to some of the typical projects in use inside Apple. So I would be surprised to learn that my experience is atypical, but maybe there is something particularly vexing about the way my projects are laid out and embedded in the workspace?\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a sample instruments document that captures the activity in the app while simply trying to filter for a simple search string. It took about 15-20 seconds before the UI would even redraw.\r\n\r\nOf course I have to use the filter occasionally but I always put off doing so because I know it will be excruciatingly slow. Worse, because the filtering starts as soon as I start typing, I often have to wait for it to filter on a substring of my search term before I can finish typing it.\r\n\r\nXcode handles the scale of my project/scheme admirably in many other respects, including e.g. indexing.\r\n\r\nCould the existing index of files be tied into the filtering mechanism for the Project Navigator? It seems to be painfully recomputing file name information every time I try to apply a filter."
