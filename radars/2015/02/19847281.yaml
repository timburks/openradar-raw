        Summary:
        It would be nice if Xcode Bots handled Git branches better. For example, Travis CI will perform a build on each branch of a repo every time a build is performed. Xcode Server, though, doesn’t allow you go configure a Bot’s branch at all, taking the active branch from when it was created and locking it in. Perhaps you could have an option for each Bot that would tell it to only build Master, but it would default to building every branch with each commit.

        Lightweight, easy branching is part of the appeal of using Git in the first place, but requiring manual setup of a new bot for each one eliminates much of that advantage.
