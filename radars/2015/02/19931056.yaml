    description: I'd love to be able to check whether a user had allowed crash report collection (like we can check for other permissions like location or photo access). That way, we could prompt and explain. It's nice that Apple asks during setup, but I'd bet a lot of people just say No without considering. And they don't really get another chance to say Yes.
