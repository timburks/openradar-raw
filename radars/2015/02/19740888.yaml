    description: "Summary:\r\nAppending more than 3 arrays on a single line causes very slow swiftc compilation times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Define 5 different Array<String> objects: e.g.\r\n  let a = [“a”, “b”, “c”] \r\n  let b = [“d”, “e”, “f”] …\r\n\r\n2. Define a new array that is the sum of all of these e.g.:\r\n  let appended = a + b + c + d + e\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSub-second compilation times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n53 second compilation times\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve attached a test swift file which can be compiled with “swiftc testcase.swift”, demonstrating the slow compilation times. If you only sum 4 objects in a line it’s an order of magnitude faster, if only 3, another order of magnitude, and so on"
