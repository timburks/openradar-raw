    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you tap on a date in Monthly view in the iOS Calendar app, it takes you to list view and displays the nearest event to the date selected. If the \"+\" button is then pushed it opens up a \"new event\" modal view, which defaults to the date of nearest event, not the date selected. This is very annoying if you want to add an event on a day when you have no other events; I commonly select a day to add an event in monthly view, then have to re-select that same day in the \"new event\" pop -up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Calendar (iPhone).\r\n2. Select a specific date in monthly view that does not have existing events.\r\n3.List view will be displayed showing events nearest the day selected.\r\n4. press '+'.\r\n5. you then have to re-enter the original date (that was selected in montly .\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Date originally selected in Monthly view will be the default date in the 'New Event' modal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe date will default to the date of the nearest previously added event.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone iOS 8/8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlternatively: Might I suggest long push on a date in monthly view calls up a \"New Event\" modal with the selected date defaulted.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone iOS 8/8.1"
