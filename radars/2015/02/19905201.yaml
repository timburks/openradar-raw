    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be really useful to be able to add an extension to (for example) Array, but only when Array contains objects that conform to a specific protocol. This currently isn’t possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write the following extension:\r\n\r\nextension Array<T: Printable> {\r\n  func descriptions() -> [String] {\r\n    return map { $0.description }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n2. Attempt to compile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe extension compiles\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe extension doesn’t compile, and throws an error that extensions on generic types cannot add requirements."
