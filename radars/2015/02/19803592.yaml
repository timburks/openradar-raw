    description: "Summary:\r\nMouse clicks in the Watch simulator windows do not appear to be delivered at the correct position (i.e. the button under the cursor is not the one that gets pressed).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload, compile and run https://github.com/happywatch/hello-watchkit\r\nAttempt to click a button.\r\nNotice it is almost impossible to hit any button other than the “View Map” button.\r\nThe problem occurs for both the 42mm and 38mm windows.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen pressing the clicking the mouse the button under the cursor should be pressed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA button above the mouse position is pressed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not occur in iOS Simulator 8.2 (553.8)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happened on a retina MacBook Pro. Since the button click seemed to be above the intended position, I wonder if a scaling of mouse coordinates is at issue. Did not have a non-retina system handy to check."
