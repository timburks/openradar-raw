        Summary:
        After dragging a NSTabViewController into a storyboard, and choosing your transition options (such as crossfade) and setting the style to "Toolbar" these settings are ignored. Subclassing NSTabViewController and overriding the relevant methods shows they are not being called. To fix this you must make your NSTabViewController the delegate of the contained NSTabView. This should be the default.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Drag a NSTabViewController into a storyboard
        2. Turn on crossfade
        3. Change the style to "Toolbar" to get the preferences window effect
        4. Run the application, switch between tabs.

        Expected Results:
        There should be a crossfade animation

        Actual Results:
        There is no animation. You first have to set the NSTabView delegate to your NSTabViewController. This should be the default.
