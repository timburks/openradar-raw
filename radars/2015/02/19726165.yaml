    description: "Summary:\r\nBy using Refactor > Rename, one can quickly rename a class, its container file, and all uses of the class, except for one: The generated comments at the top of the .h and .m files. This causes a lot of out-of-date comments when classes are renamed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a class\r\n2. Refactor > Rename it to something different\r\n3. Everything is changed except generated comments at the top of the .h and .m files\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGenerated comments should change to match new class/file name\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGenerated comments do not change to match new class/file name\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 5, OS X 10.10.2"
