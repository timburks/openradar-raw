    description: "Summary:\r\nSince OS X 10.10 USB Audio interfaces that come driverless and are directly supported by CoreAudio cut out when using GPU or CPU intense applications.\r\nTo get audio going again one needs to switch back to internal Speakers and back to the USB device again.\r\nThis makes working in Final Cut Pro X almost impossible since it is both CPU and GPU intense.\r\nExample Devices: \r\n- Griffin iMic\r\n- Alesis IO2 Express\r\n- Teufel Concept C 100\r\n- Soundblaster Tactic 3D\r\n\r\nConsole lists something like: \r\n28/11/14 11:48:52,000 kernel[0]: USB Sound assertion in AppleUSBAudioStream at line 4858\r\nwhen audio cuts out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect one of the USB audio devices listed above\r\n2. Listen to music on OS X 10.10\r\n3. do something GPU or CPU intense (on a 2012 MacBookPro Retina, Mission control often already does ist). repeat until 4. happens\r\n4. Hear the music stopping.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe USB audio not to cut out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUSB Audio cuts out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.1"
