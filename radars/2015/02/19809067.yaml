    description: "Summary:\r\nI cannot successfully subclass an NSInputStream from Swift regardless of what I try. I've attached a simple sample project showing that I cannot successfully override the `init(data:)` initializer.\r\n\r\nThe documentation make it very clear that this should work from Swift, yet it doesn't appear to be possible. I've seen examples of subclasses from Objective-C and have implemented them myself, but I cannot call the default init method from Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the example app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCustomStream would initializer properly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCustomStream creation crashes at runtime.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 Beta 5\r\n\r\n========= Update =============\r\n\r\nThis has been resolved in the latest Xcode 7 beta."
