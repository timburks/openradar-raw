        Summary:
        Xcode doesn't respect project's indentation setting when editing code in Assistant editor.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set indentation setting in Xcode’s Editing Preference (mine is 2 with spaces)
        2. Open some Xcode project, set the indentation in File Inspector (mine is 4 with spaces)
        3. Open Assistant editor and then indent some codes.


        Expected Results:
        Xcode indents with Xcode project’s indentation setting (in this case is 4 with spaces)

        Actual Results:
        Xcode ignores project’s indentation setting (use Xcode editing setting instead, in this case is 2 with spaces)

        Regression:


        Notes:
        In the normal editor, it works correctly.
