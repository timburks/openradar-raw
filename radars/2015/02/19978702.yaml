    description: "This has been resolved by Apple as an intermittent server issue, which they claim to have fixed around 3/4/15.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen paying with Apple Pay in an app, after authorizing the payment with Touch ID, occasionally the payment will fail with a “Payment Not Completed” message (similar to the effect that occurs when one calls the completion handler in paymentAuthorizationViewController:didAuthorizePayment:completion with PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusFailure). When this error occurs, the PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate doesn’t receive any callbacks (in other words, the error appears internal to Apple Pay and unrelated to the application code). This error appears to occur intermittently for some cards and persistently for others. Removing and re-adding the card seems to temporarily fix the issue. At Stripe, we’ve observed this error in several different apps (including ones not using Stripe).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn an app that supports Apple Pay, begin a payment and use Touch ID to authorize a purchase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController’s delegate receives the “paymentAuthorizationViewController:didAuthorizePayment:completion” callback, and upon calling completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusSuccess), the PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController displays a success animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController displays a failure animation, and calls no methods on its delegate.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe error is intermittent, but we’ve reproduced it with a Visa credit card on an iPhone 6. We first started seeing it/receiving error reports from our customers on February 24, 2015.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs mentioned previously, removing the card from Apple Pay and re-adding it appears to temporarily solve the issue (although after doing this, we saw the same issue a few hours later)."
