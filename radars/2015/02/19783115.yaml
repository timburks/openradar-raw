        Summary:
        NSApp is declared as type 'id'. This invites lots of hilarious bugs and avoids lots of clever warnings the compiler could make about these mistakes.

        Examples:
        Auto-completion in Xcode suggests the NSSavePanel method beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler: or NSWindow's similar method being suggested for NSApp, whereas the NSApplication method is called beginSheet:modalForWindow:modalDelegate:didEndSelector:

        The wrong -delegate method is resolved, giving spurious and unnecessary errors about my app delegate not conforming to NSFileManagerDelegate.

        Notes:
        I hear this bug already exists in your system from someone else as rdar://problem/19782811

        All of these issues and distractions could easily be fixed by just declaring it as an NSApplication*.
