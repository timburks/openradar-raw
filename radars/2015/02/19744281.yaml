    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen recording a lightning-attached iPhone using File > New Movie Recording and selecting the attached iPhone as the target, the recording will freeze when that iPhone accesses the camera. The QuickTime UI continues to count as if the recording is ongoing, but ending the recording and saving it shows that it ended the instant the camera is accessed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an iOS device with a camera to a mac running OS X Yosemite.\r\n2. Open QuickTime Player and select New Movie Recording.\r\n3. In the dropdown menu next to the record button, select the iPhone as the video source.\r\n4. Begin recording.\r\n5. On the iPhone, navigate to an app that accesses the camera. I first encountered this with my app using AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer, but Camera.app or any app that uses UIImagePickerController also works.\r\n6. Open the app, access the camera, and close the camera.\r\n7. Observe that changes on the device are no longer reflected in QuickTime.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither the camera should be properly recorded or, if technically infeasible, the camera should appear disabled to the device. The recording should continue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe recording appears to continue but actually is ended.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nQuickTime Player 10.4, OS X 10.10.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.2, iOS 8.1.3.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
