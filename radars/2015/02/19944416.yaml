    description: "Our [APP] iOS app (APP_ID) was rejected for violating 10.6 in the AppStore guidelines:\r\n\r\n----\r\nWe noticed an issue in your app that contributes to a lower quality user experience than Apple users expect. Specifically, \r\n\r\n- Upon launching the app, a web page in mobile Safari opens for logging in to google plus, then returns the user to the app. The user should be able to log in without opening Safari first. \r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is the expected user flow for a user attempting to log in with Google Plus.  If the user does not have the Google Plus app installed on their device they must sign in to their Google account (in Safari) to authenticate with Google and accept the permissions.  Once complete the user is returned to the [APP] app with a token that allows us to create an account.\r\n\r\nWe think that this is a better user experience than asking users to re-enter their Google credentials in an in-app-browser when they might already be logged in to their Google account in Safari. Any usability issues is outweighed by only having to enter your credentials once for single sign on.\r\n\r\nOther services that provide authentication (most notably, Facebook) redirect users to Safari if their app is not installed."
