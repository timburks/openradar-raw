    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen searching for a term that matches many file items on disk, it can be impossible to differentiate from among the matches, if the name of the container folder, combined with the name of the match, is too long to show uniquely in the list of matches.\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshot. I've got several \"RSCommonLib.xcodeproj\" matches, and I want to open the one in a folder called \"Sources-Modern\". I've got a bunch of other folders called \"Sources-Whatever\" and I *don't* want to choose one of those.\r\n\r\nSince the UI for the Spotlight results window can't be modified at all by e.g. growing it, I'm stuck choosing one and hoping I got it right.\r\n\r\nIf Spotlight used some of that copious breathing room on the right (detail) side of the UI to show the full name of the container folder, I would be able to choose with confidence.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3 (14D72i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Spotlight.png' was successfully uploaded."
