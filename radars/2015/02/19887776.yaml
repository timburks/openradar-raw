    description: "Summary:\r\nUnreproducible, sometimes, the swiping gestures for switching between spaces break concurrently for the magic mouse as well as the magic trackpad. Killing the dock process or the finder process (or both) doesn't reenable them. Only reboot fixes the problem so far.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSadly, as I wasn't able to get a specific chain of actions, I can only say something like \"use a Mac for at least something like 2 days uptime until this behavior shows\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nswipe gestures should always work regardless of uptime\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nin my experience, after at least roughly 2 days of uptime, at some point, swiping gestures don't work anymore.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 14C109\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Late 2009\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
