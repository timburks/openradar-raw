Present an action sheet using showFromRect:inView:animated: method\r\n2. Choose one of the options presented (if the action sheet is simply dismissed the bug does not present)\r\n3. Observe as the reference count of the view the sheet was presented from is irrevocably upped by one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDO NOT leak view the action sheet is presented in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDOES leak view the action sheet is presented in.\r\n\r\nNOTA BENE iOS 7 does not leak.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 â€“ iOS 8.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached sample project illustrates this issue. Watch the logs, if the sheet is dismissed the view it is presented from is dealloced on both iOS 8 and iOS 7, if however one of the options is selected the view is only dealloced on iOS 7 and leaks on iOS 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ActionSheetMemoryLeak.zip' was successfully uploaded."
