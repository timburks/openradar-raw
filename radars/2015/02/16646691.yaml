    description: "Summary:\r\nThe relevancy of passes depends on the relevantDate, which isn't suited for train tickets: tickets control can happen during travel, several hours after departure.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nWe provide passbook boarding passes for Europe train tickets at www.capitainetrain.com.\r\nOur customers rely on the pass before boarding to find their seat, and present it upon inspection. However, several customers reported that the pass wasn't visible anymore on the lock screen upon inspection, hours after departure.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd like to provide a relevancy period. Alternatively, the relevant period should be extended (5 hours would be reasonable) for boarding passes of type PKTransitTypeTrain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.1"
