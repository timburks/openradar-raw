This really should be included in iCloud Photo Library as It defeats the purpose if that is not synced.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up faces on one computer.\r\n2. Setup up photos on a second computer using iCloud Photo Library\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Set up faces on one computer.\r\n2. Setup up photos on a second computer using iCloud Photo Library\r\n2. See faces syncing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo faces are synced and I have to set it up again on the second computer.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
