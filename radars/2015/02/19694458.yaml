    description: "Summary:\nThe original Test Flight service collected, symbolicated and reported crashes to developers, but this seems to be missing from the new one. \n\niTunes Connect also previously collected some crashes (though it wasn't very effective at getting them all)\n\nThis means we still have to setup and pay for a service like http://hockeyapp.net/features/ to collect and symbolicate crash reports. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Release a beta\n2. Get feedback about a crash\n3. Force non-technical user through the arduous process of manually collecting crash reports\n4. Symbolicate them manually.\n\nExpected Results:\n1. Release a beta\n2. Log in to iTunes Connect and view beautifully symbolicated crash reports, broken down by app version, userâ€™s iOS version, etc.\n\nActual Results:\n1. Beg / force non-technical user through the arduous process of manually collecting crash reports\n2. Symbolicate them manually.\n3. Sad.\n\nRegression:\nThis feature was in iTunes Connect (kind of) and was also in the original Test Flight.\n\nNotes:\nhttp://www.crashprobe.com has some good tests to measure the quality of crash reports."
