    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a new Watch App target, InterfaceController.{h,m} are created for you. awakeWithContext: is stubbed out with a comment that says \"// Configure interface objects here.\". However, according to the documentation, init should be used for setting up and configuring interface objects, and awakeWithContext: should only be used to finish setting things up.\r\n\r\nTo developers new to WatchKit (a.k.a. everyone), this could be very misleading, encouraging use of awakeWithContext: for all setup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new iOS app project\r\n2. Create new Watch app target, embedded in the iOS app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe generated code should have \"// Configure interface objects here.\" in the stubbed out init method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe generated code has \"// Configure interface objects here.\" in the stubbed out awakeWithContext: method.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 5, OS X 10.10.2"
