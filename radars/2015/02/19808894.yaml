        Summary:
        In the iOS 8.1.1 simulator from Xcode 6.1.1, Game Center takes 2-3 seconds to sign in. On the iOS 8.3 simulator bundled with Xcode 6.3 beta 1, it consistently takes about 17 seconds to log in. This hinders debugging Game Center apps.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Start the iOS 8.3 simulator (iOS build 12F5027d) that comes with Xcode 6.3 beta (6D520o).
        2. Go to Settings -> Game Center.
        3. Log out of Game Center.
        4. Log in to Game Center.

        You can also observe this by running the Game Center sample project, GKAuthentication.

        Expected Results:
        Game Center logs in within a second or two, as it does on iOS 8.1.

        Actual Results:
        In multiple timed runs across multiple days, it takes about 17 seconds to log in (times came in between 16 and 19 seconds.) This happens both in Settings and in my Game Center enabled app, and in the Game Center sample project.

        Regression:
        Strangely, this still works fine, logging in about 2 seconds’ time, on the iOS 8.1 simulator.

        Notes:
        - I am logging in to the account contact@steamclock.com from Vancouver, BC.
        - The delay is long enough that most users would assume the log in has failed.
        - In the Settings app, the Sign In button doesn’t disable until a few seconds in to the process, which is odd.
