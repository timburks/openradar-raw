    description: "Summary: when plugging in or unplugging headphones during video recording on an iPhone 4 or iPad 2, the audio becomes garbled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. start recording video with Camera.app.\r\n2. unplug or plug in headphones, this bug happens either way.\r\n3. keep recording video after changing the headphones.\r\n4. stop recording.\r\n5. Play back video on device or computer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: audio should sound normal all the way through the recording.\r\n\r\nActual Results: audio becomes garbled after changing the headphones. If you switch from headphones to no headphones, the audio after that point is unintelligible static. If you switch from no headphones to headphones, you can still make out words but voices sound like Daleks from Doctor Who.\r\n\r\nRegression: audio is perfectly audible when plugging or unplugging headphones on iOS 4.3.3 on an iPhone 4.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nVideos demonstrating the problem (turn down your speakers, because they get loud at the end): http://cl.ly/ZxMF"
