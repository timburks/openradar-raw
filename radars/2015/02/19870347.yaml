    description: "This is a duplicate filing of rdar://19270866. That radar was closed as a duplicate of an older issue which is also closed. But the problem is still very much present, so I'm opening a new one.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build a project today, Xcode complained that there were no provisioning profiles matching the project's app ID.\r\n\r\nThis was odd since I successfully built the project as recently as yesterday.\r\n\r\nI checked Xcode's accounts settings and it reports that I do not belong to any developer teams. That probably explains why it can't find a provisioning profile, but it doesn't actually make any sense since I do belong to at least one developer team-- my own.\r\n\r\nLogging in to Apple's developer site validates this. Not only does my account still belong to my own team, but there is in fact a provisioning profile matching my current project's app ID.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS developer account\r\n2. Use this account to develop and build apps\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAssuming that the account and project are set up correctly, the process would continue to work without interruption until such time as account memberships, certificates, etc expire.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode will transition from \"working\" to \"reporting stupid inaccurate errors\" for no readily discernible reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3 (6D520o)\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome illustrative pictures are attached:\r\n\r\n1. warning.png : Xcode incorrectly claiming that there is no provisioning profile matching the app ID.\r\n2. accounts.png : Xcode incorrectly claiming that my developer account does not belong to any teams.\r\n3. profile.png : Details of the provisioning profile, from my developer account, which matches the app ID shown in warning.png.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs sometimes but not at others, and of course there's no indication of anything changing that would tend to cause a change in behavior.\r\n\r\nThis specific behavior is new to me, but in a way it's not the least bit surprising. See also rdar://18731831, \"Code signing is flaky and unreliable\".\r\n\r\nEasily the worst part of the entire Apple software developer ecosystem is the process for code signing apps. This radar is yet another example of it failing to work for no readily apparent reason, accompanied by Xcode giving error messages that are just plain incorrect, with no apparent steps to resolve the issue on my end. It worked yesterday! Nothing expired since then! But nevertheless, thanks to code signing I'm up shit creek right now.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
