        Summary:
        I have a designable view. In init method, I override the background color of that view to some color. When I look at the storyboard, its background color does not set. (I debugged and found that IBDesignable is reset the property to nil.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a UIView subclass, in init method, set the background color to some color (mine is 0,0,0,0.8 RGBA)
        2. Add this view to storyboard, wait for IBDesignable to do its work.

        Expected Results:
        View has the background color that is set in the init method.

        Actual Results:
        its background color is clear color

        Regression:


        Notes:
        1. I debugged this case and found that it background color is reset to nil.
        2. I didnâ€™t try other properties so there might be other properties that are affected by this bug.
