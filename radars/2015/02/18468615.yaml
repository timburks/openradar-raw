    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an app has an ampersand in its title (i.e. Dine & Dash) when you create a Launch Screen xib file for the app through File -> New File, the default label with the name of the app in the resulting xib has an unescaped ampersand. This is invalid XML and Xcode will refuse to open the file. It's possible to fix the problem by opening the xib file and manually replacing the ampersand.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project with an ampersand in its title (i.e. Dine & Dash.)\r\n2. Create a launch screen xib by going to File -> New File and choosing Launch Screen.\r\n3. Xcode will give this error: Line 23: xmlParseEntityRef: no name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ampersand should be escaped or replaced with a different character so the xib can be opened.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe xib cannot be opened without being manually edited.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-09-26 at 10.29.25 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
