        Summary:
        There is no way in Xcode to specify, for example, a 2-space tab-width for Objective-C files and a 4-space tab-width for Swift files.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Go into Xcode -> Preferences -> Text Editing -> Indentation
        Notice that all tab width configuration is done on a global basis. There is no way to specify it based on file type.

        Expected Results:
        Tab Width should be configurable at several levels:
        - global
        - .xcodeproj
        - file type (e.g. .m vs .swift)

        Actual Results:
        Tab width can only be set globally.

        Notes:
        This feature is important to us because we have a large objective-c codebase that we are slowly migrating to Swift. The objc code was all written with 2-space tabs to try to reduce the length of lines due to objc verbosity. This is no longer desirable in Swift, and we would like to write all new Swift code going forward with a 4-space tab.
