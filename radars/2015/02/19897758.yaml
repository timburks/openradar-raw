Safari currently will only reopen the last closed tab with Command-Z\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open 3 tabs in Safari.\r\n2. Close 2 of the tabs.\r\n3. Press Command-Z\r\n4. Press Command-Z again.\r\n5. Only the last closed tab will be restored.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Open 3 tabs in Safari.\r\n2. Close 2 of the tabs.\r\n3. Press some-new-command-sequence.\r\n4. Press some-new-command-sequence again.\r\n5. Both tabs are restored with their history intact.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0.3 (10600.3.18)\r\nOS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
