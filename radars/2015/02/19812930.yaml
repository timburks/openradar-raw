    description: "The phrase ‘Build Configuration’ is used both in Xcode and Swift to mean different things - both related to building/compiling code, but different things.\r\n\r\nIt is confusing to overload terminology in this way, since an Xcode build configuration is not a Swift build configuration, but you could set the flag for a Swift build configuration in an Xcode build configuration.\r\n\r\n(Re-read that last paragraph. It would read a lot better if ‘build configuration’ wasn’t the same term for both).\r\n\r\nPlease consider calling it something like a ‘build conditions’, ‘build options’, ‘build predicates’ or something similar in Swift.\r\n\r\n(So many documents, articles, tutorials, etc. have been written about Xcode build configurations since they were introduced in 2005, changing the term in Xcode would lose a great deal of knowledge.)"
