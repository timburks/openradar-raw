    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening the product page of an app using SKStoreProductViewController, the \"Write a review\" button is disabled. Users should be able to write reviews from within an app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen an app product page using SKStoreProductViewController, \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should be able to tap “Write a review” and write a review.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe “Write a review” button is disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS7.*, iOS8b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is probably a duplicate, but I did not find anything on openradar. Also, it used to work back in iOS 6.\r\n\r\nFinally, the “Rate this app” button isn’t grayed out on iOS 8, but still does nothing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, iPad 3\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
