    description: "Summary:\nOccasionally you may have a situation where a particular method may need to be implemented for a subclass. \n\nThe current Cocoa convention is to throw a runtime exception if the method is called on the superclass, but this is dangerous and could be made into a much safer compile-time error with the addition of a compiler annotation.\n\nAn example would be where you have a protocol, and a base concrete implementation - that needs subclassing to be properly useful/functional.\n\nAn example use case is here: https://gist.github.com/DanielTomlinson/806b6c8fe96957156f72\n\nThanks!"
