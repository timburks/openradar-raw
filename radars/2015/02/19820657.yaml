        Summary:
        There’s a containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: method but no securityApplicationGroupIdentifierForURL: method.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Be passed a URL/path that’s a child of a URL obtained via containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:. Attempt to create a named semaphore, which requires the prefix of an app group. Attempt to obtain the app group ID from the given path/URL.

        Expected Results:
        There’s a method to obtain the app group ID from the given path/URL.

        Actual Results:
        No such method exists.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        This makes it very hard to create named semaphores or mach ports that are supposed to work across processes.
