    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode, I can jump by camel case substrings of words by using the Control key and the left and right arrow keys. I wish I could do this in native text fields throughout OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Spend all day editing text in Xcode.\r\n2. Get used to being able to use Control-Left Arrow and Control-Right Arrow to jump the insertion point left or right by camel case substrings.\r\n3. Try to use this shortcut elsewhere in the system, or even in native text fields in Xcode (the most notable examples being the Search field, and any text fields where you might type a class name, such as in Interface Builder).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNative text fields support Control-Left Arrow and Control-Right Arrow to jump by camel case substrings of words, just like they support a wide range of classic Mac and Emacs text navigation shortcuts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCamel case substring cursor movement is not available in these text fields. This is especially annoying in Xcode, because it is inconsistent as well as annoying. If Iâ€™m used to being able to jump around within camel case strings in one part of the app, I would like to be able to do it everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
