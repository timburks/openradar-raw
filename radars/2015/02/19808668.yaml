    description: "Summary:\r\nLike in other platforms (Android: Settings > Developer > Show touch points. Windows Phone has this feature as well) it would be useful to a setting somewhere that shows touches in screen. I as a developer (or a conferences that needs to show his iOS device screen to others through a projector, etc)\r\n\r\nSeeing touches and gestures is incredible useful when :\r\n- doing demos\r\n- recording preview videos (to upload to the AppStore for example)\r\n- showing my screen to other people through a display or projector\r\n- when recording the screen using QuickTime\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee above description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee above description\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ntouch points show on screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS devices"
