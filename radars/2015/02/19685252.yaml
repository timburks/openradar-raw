        Summary:
        When you open a link (from Messages, Mail, Twitter, etc.), it should always open in the current desktop. If you already have a window open in another desktop, though, the new window opens there instead

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Connect a second display, so you have two desktops
        2. Set your preferences, so each display has separate spaces
        3. Open Mail in Desktop A, and a Safari window in Desktop B
        4. Focus Mail
        5. Click on a link in a Mail message

        Expected Results:
        The link opens in a Safari window on Desktop A, since that’s where you’re currently working

        Actual Results:
        The Safari window on Desktop B gets focused before the new window opens, causing it to open on Desktop B instead
