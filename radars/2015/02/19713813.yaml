    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen interacting with a DOM element with the contenteditable attribute, holding shift and navigating with the cursor keys on a hardware keyboard does not perform text selection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe attached example project (https://github.com/BipSync/ios-wkwebview-contenteditable/releases/tag/1.0.0) illustrates the issue. It can be observed in the iOS Simulator and on devices. \r\n\r\nAttach a hardware keyboard, tap the text in the WKWebView so the caret appears, hold down shift and use the cursor keys to navigate the text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText selection should be performed with the standard set of shortcuts (e.g. shift and cursor key, shift/alt/cursor, shift/cmd/cursor, etc.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe caret moves but text selection does not occur."
