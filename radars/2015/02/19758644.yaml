    description: |-
        The documentation states that a String literal in Swift can be “An arbitrary Unicode scalar, written as \u{n}, where n is between one and eight hexadecimal digits”

        https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID293

        In the current version of Swift, the value for n must be between 1 and 5 hexadecimal digits (which is consistent with the 21-bit number used to represent the value.)
