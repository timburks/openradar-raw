    description: "Michael Zornek18-Feb-2015 12:28 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I use the UIImagePickerController to the user and allow them to use the camera to take a photo and then edit it the crop tool offered does not work right. It does not allow the user to crop at the very top or very bottom of the photo. If you instead allow the user to choose a photo from their library the crop tool works as I would expect.\r\n\r\nPlease see demo project and demo movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIImagePickerController for the camera.\r\nTurn on the edit mode.\r\nWatch user take photo but unable to crop to image's absolute top or bottom.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the user to be allowed to drag the image around to it's full extent and crop the image at the very top and very bottom like how they can when working with a photo from the photo library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see the image bouncing back to some initial position.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n iOS 8.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CameraCropBugDemo.zip' and 'CameraCropBugDemoMovie-480.mov' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/24f0e4k021wvmyg/CameraCropBugDemo.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jq4gl0t05ngx6dl/CameraCropBugDemoMovie-480.mov?dl=0"
