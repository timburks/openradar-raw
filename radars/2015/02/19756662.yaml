    description: "In the interest of facilitating overloading of the == operator, would it be possible to define the == function for NSobject as a generic instead? That is, instead of \n\nfunc == (lhs: NSObject, rhs: NSObject) -> Bool \n\nmake it\n\nfunc == <T: NSObject, U: NSObject>(lhs: T, rhs: U) -> Bool\n\nThe issue is that because the default definition names classes and is not a generic template, it is hard to override. NO possible generic version of ==() can override it, and also NO possible protocol-based version of ==(). That means youâ€™re pretty much stuck adding a separate ==() function of your own for every possible combination of classes."
