        Summary:
        With all the Xcode versions now, my company is developing for different iOS releases. This causes an issue where we can not have one server running multiple Xcode versions. Bots need a way to declare their version of Xcode that it needs to build a product. I.E. Xcode 6.2 for apple watch builds, but Xcode 6.1 for a current production build. It could be a config much like travisci.org uses for php versions.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a bot for an apple watch app with a server running Xcode 6.1.
        2. Run the bot

        Expected Results:
        1. The bot should auto select an appropriate Xcode version based on what is defined in a bot file.

        Actual Results:
        1. The bot runs on selected versions of Xcode as defined.

        Regression:
        None
