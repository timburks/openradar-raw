    description: "Summary:\r\nSay we have a function with a variadic argument of enum type. If we pass in only one argument, the enum must be fully qualified. If we pass in more than one argument, the enums don't have to be fully qualified.\r\n\r\nThe compiler should not treat a single T passed into a function with a T... vararg parameter as a [T], which seems to be the cause of this error.\r\n\r\nAn annotated sample project demonstrating this has been enclosed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Define an enum:\r\nenum MyEnum { case Foo, Bar, Baz }\r\n\r\n2. Define a function taking a variadic parameter of that enum type:\r\nfunc variadicFunc(x: MyEnum...) { /* do stuff */ }\r\n\r\n3. Try to call the function with the non-fully-qualified enum:\r\nvariadicFunc(.Foo)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis code should compile, and act identically as \"variadicFunc(MyEnum..Foo)\", which does compile and work as expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe code does not compile, with the error \"'(MyEnum...).Type\" does not have a member named 'Foo'\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 (6A2008a), OS X 10.9.5"
