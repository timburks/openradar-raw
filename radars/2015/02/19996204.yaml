        Summary:
        Often I’m only looking for a file which I want to copy some where else, e.g to iCloud Drive, but I don’t want to open the file (the preview is usually enough). I would be nice to be able to ctrl click on the file in the search result and have an option to reveal the file in the Finder.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Search for a file with Spotlight
        2) Control click the file

        Expected Results:
        Context menu with an option to reveal the file in the Finder

        Actual Results:
        No context menu, no ability to see where the found file is on the file system

        Regression:
