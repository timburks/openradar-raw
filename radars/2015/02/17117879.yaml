    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using a hot corner to put my display to sleep and at the same time to require authentication when I press any buttons. Sometimes waking up from sleep the login screen doesn't immediately show up but only shows a black screen. The mouse pointer is also visible, but I'm not able to log in. The same also happens sometimes when closing my machine and waking it up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Move cursor to hot corner to put display to sleep or close notebook\r\n2. Press any key or open notebook\r\n3. See black screen and not the login dialog\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to immediately login\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlack screen with mouse pointer visible and movable.
