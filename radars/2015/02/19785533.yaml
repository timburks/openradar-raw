    description: "Summary:\r\nWith many keyboards installed, it is cumbersome to jump to the one you want. Custom keyboards should be able to present the iOS system keyboard picker control from the stock keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install several custom keyboards. I have four, including the System one:\r\n - 1. system English keyboard\r\n - 2. Nintype (for fast typing)\r\n - 3. Emoji++ (for favorite emoji)\r\n - 4. Uniconsole (for favorite special Unicode characters)\r\n2. Attempt to switch quickly between different keyboards.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll keyboards can produce a menu of active keyboards with a press-and-hold on the globe icon, letting you choose the one you want.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe System keyboard works in this way, but custom third-party keyboards’ globe icon just cycles you to the next keyboard. Since some keyboards take a little while to load, if you have more than a couple of keyboards installed, this can be a slow process.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has always been a problem since third-party keyboards were added in iOS 8, but it wasn’t really noticeable until I had more than one custom keyboard installed. It’s like Woz, inventing a universal remote because he was one of the first people with a coffee table covered in infrared remotes."
