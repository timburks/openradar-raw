    description: "Summary:\r\nUploading videos as App Previews for iOS apps will time out after a very short time. Video files are notoriously large, so this is a major problem for developers who do not have access to an exceptionally fast internet connection.\r\n\r\nBased on our experiences, the upload timeout appears to be approximately 3 minutes, which would require a minimum upload speed of about 2.5Mbit/s for a 40MB file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get an iOS app submission ready, using Safari on OS X Yosemite.\r\n2. Prepare an App Preview video in iMovie, say with a file size of around 40MB.\r\n3. Connect to the web using an internet connection that has an upload speed of probably over 90% of the world's internet connections, e.g. an ADSL connection with 800kbit/s uplink as is very common in Europe. Alternatively, use Link Conditioner to simulate such a connection.\r\n4. Attempt to upload the video as the app preview.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe upload should successfully complete in around 9-10 minutes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter 9-10 minutes, the video preview in the UI gets a red frame, and shows the error \"Your file could not be loaded. Try again.\" if you hover over it with the mouse.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused by a timeout, as the problem does not appear with a faster connection.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari/8.0.2/OS X 10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe timeout should be increased to something much more reasonable. The upload for an App can frequently take an hour or more, and succeeds without timeout, so it is clear this is not a technical limitation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the error message generated if the timeout occurs is not helpful and does not indicate that the reason for upload failure is a timeout. I have reported this issue separately as rdar://19969261\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n * OSX Yosemite 10.10.2\r\n * Safari 8.0.3\r\n * 38.5MB App Preview video created in iMovie\r\n\r\nFails: ADSL internet connection with 10Mbit/s download, 0.8Mbit/s upload speeds\r\n\r\nSucceeds: Mac using an iPhone 5's 10Mbit/s down, 3.5 Mbit/s up 3G connection via Personal Hotspot."
