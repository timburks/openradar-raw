    description: "Summary:\r\nThe only way at the moment to apply a tint color to an image is to use a WKInterfaceImage and set the tint color. While this works for some cases, it does not work for them all.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I need to place a label ontop of the image, I cannot use a WKInterfaceImage, I need to use a WKInterfaceGroup and place the label inside the group and set the background image of the group. This works fine, until you need to tint the image. This is currently not possible and is very limiting. This results in having to add a custom image for every possible color combination which can be extremely tedious for both designers and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe worst case is if the background image needs to be an animated image. This results in having to add an imageset to the asset catalog for each color. This actually ends up taking hours.\r\n\r\nAdding the ability to set the tint color on the background image of a WKInterfaceGroup would be incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 Beta 5 and OS X 10.10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
