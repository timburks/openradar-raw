        Summary:
        Currently when I imported photos from iPhoto I had duplicate faces. There is no way to merge duplicate faces of the same person.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a face for someone.
        2. Create a face for someone say without their last name.

        Expected Results:
        1. Create a face for someone.
        2. Create a face for someone say without their last name.
        3. Realize you already had another “face icon” for the second person.
        4. Drag one Face icon onto the other.
        5. They are merged

        Actual Results:
        1. Create a face for someone.
        2. Create a face for someone say without their last name.
        3. Realize you already had another “face icon” for the second person.
        4. Drag one Face icon onto the other. (You can not do this.)



        Regression:
        None.

        Notes:
        None.
