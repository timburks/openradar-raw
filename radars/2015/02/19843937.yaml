        Summary:

        When scrolling web pages in iOS Safari on larger screen devices, the scroll speed is too low and/or the deceleration is too high, which makes it hard work to scroll through larger web pages.

        This does not appear to be a general problem with UIScrollViews - other apps which use them seem to be OK.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        (On iPhone 6 Plus)

        1. Open Safari
        2. Navigate to a large web page
        3. Swipe vertically to scroll
        4. Observe it feels like hard work to scroll a long way down the page, compared to smaller screened devices

        Expected Results:

        Larger screen devices should adapt the scrolling speed and/or use less deceleration friction, to account for the fact the user can see more on the screen at once.

        Actual Results:

        Painfully slow scrolling.
