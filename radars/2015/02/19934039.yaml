    description: Currently to use the contents of an asset catalog an engineer must map a string in code to the name of the asset in the catalog. This can lead to many issues if, e.g., assets get renamed or a developer simply mistypes the string, since there's no way to verify at compile time that the string references an extant asset. There are third-party tools (https://github.com/square/objc-codegenutils) which export header files filled with constants which serve as a stop-gap solutionâ€”it would be nice if Xcode could automatically populate the project's module with constants to minimize dependencies in the build workflow.
