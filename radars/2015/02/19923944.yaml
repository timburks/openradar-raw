        Summary:
        In a library with many photos you may want to ignore a lot of suggested faces at one time. Currently you can not command click suggested faces to select multiple faces at once.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a library with a lot of suggested faces.
        2. Try to command click two faces.

        Expected Results:
        1. Have a library with a lot of suggested faces.
        2. Try to command click two faces.
        3. Both faces become selected allowing you to ignore both faces at once.

        Actual Results:
        1. Have a library with a lot of suggested faces.
        2. Try to command click two faces.
        3. Command clicking another face deselects the first face.

        Regression:
