        Summary:
        Sometimes in a UIViewController it is necessary to trigger loading the view in order to being able to access the view outlets.
        This is commonly done via `[self view];`.
        In Xcode 6.3 Beta, this produces a compile error though: "property access result unused - getters should not be used for side effects".

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * In code, write `[self view];` in any UIViewController.
        * It will result in a compile error.

        Expected Results:
        It should compile without error.

        Actual Results:
        The compile error "property access result unused - getters should not be used for side effects" is output.

        Regression:
        In Xcode 6.1.1 this worked fine.
