    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is important for the Developer Community to keep up with the fast pace at which Swift and other Developer Tools are being improved.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is made more difficult for Open Source projects that use free Continuous Integration services, such as https://travis-ci.com/, which are currently being prevented from offering Xcode 6.3beta1 by the NDA associated with the Developer Agreement.\r\n\r\nGiven the high number of backwards incompatible changes in Swift 1.2, maintainers of Open Source projects face the decision of having broken or disabled Continuous Integration until Xcode 6.3 is released publicly or putting up with the additional overhead maintaining two separate branches.\r\n\r\nThis energy would be better spent improving their libraries, supporting the Developer Community in other ways or delighting users with great Applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to run Continuous Integration on Travis, e.g.: https://github.com/robb/Cartography/pull/76\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build passes since Xcode 6.3beta1 is available on Travis CI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build does not pass since Xcode 6.3beta1 is not available on Travis CI.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.3beta1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
