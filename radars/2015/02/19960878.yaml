        Summary:
        When running an iOS app containing an extension (e.g. Today Extension) attached to Xcode, the app may fail to launch with error: “A signed resource has been added modified or deleted.”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Build and run an iOS app that contains a Today Extension on an attached iPhone.
        2. After the first install, running may result in the error “A signed resource has been added modified or deleted.”

        Expected Results:
        The app should run normally

        Actual Results:
        Xcode displays an error message: “A signed resource has been added modified or deleted.” Cleaning and running again seems to correct the problem, but is very slow.
