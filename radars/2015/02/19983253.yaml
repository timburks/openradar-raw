        Summary:

        UIDevice-identifierForVendor is imported like that
            var identifierForVendor: NSUUID! { get } // a UUID that may be used to uniquely identify the device, same across apps from a single vendor.

        The docs say it can be nil though:
        If the value is nil, wait and get the value again later. This happens, for example, after the device has been restarted but before the user has unlocked the device.

        https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIDevice/identifierForVendor

        Thus it should be imported as an Optional
