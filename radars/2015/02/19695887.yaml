        Summary:
        If a table is hidden via a WatchKit appâ€™s storyboard while rows of multiple types are inserted, some rows do not layout properly.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See the attached sample project.
        1 - Create an Interface with a hidden table, and multiple row types
        2 - Insert rows of both types into the hidden table
        3 - Unhide the table

        Expected Results:
        All row layout is properly completed.

        Actual Results:
        The layout of the first row of the table is not done properly. It seems that subviews are hidden, and the row is not sized to fit its content.

        Notes:
        If the table is hidden programmatically rather than via the storyboard, this does not seem to reproduce.
