        Summary:
        Fullscreen project/workspace windows with tab bars open have the tab bar draw all in black.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a project.
        2. Open some tabs in it.
        3. Go into fullscreen mode.


        Expected Results:
        I expected the tabs to be displayed.


        Actual Results:
        Only the active tab was displayed, the rest were drawn fully in black.


        Regression:
        This is a regression since 6.1.1. Unsure about 6.2 because I don’t recall whether I’ve used it.


        Notes:
        Screenshot attached.
