    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I'm really excited that my alma mater did something great I want to use Siri or dictation to let people know. So I say, \"Siri send a text to Mark Richt saying Go Dawgs! Sic 'em! Woof, woof, woof!\". Of course the word \"woof\" isn't exactly pronounced \"woof\" it's more guttural than that. More like an actual dog barking. I think it would be fantastic for Siri or dictation to recognize the phrase and put the correct spelling of the phrase in for me and all the Georgia Bulldog fans out there.\r\n\r\nFor reference this phrase is a part of The University of Georgia fight song. It can be found here: http://www.georgiadogs.com/school-bio/songs.html\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAsk Siri or dictation to recognize the phrase, \"Go Dawgs! Sic 'em! Woof, woof, woof!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri or dictation should recognize the phrase as \"Go dawgs sic 'em woof woof woof\".\r\n\r\nBonus points for the correct punctuation, \"Go Dawgs! Sic 'em! Woof, woof, woof!\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri or dictionary recognizes it as, \"Go dogs sikkim\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB T-Mobile, using WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
