    description: "Summary:\r\nI often have multiple Xcode windows open when I am developing. I often hide the side bars and the Toolbar to have more space to look at code. \r\n\r\nSometimes I have 1 window with a Toolbar open, and one or more without their Toolbar open. If I close the only window with a Toolbar open, it closes all the windows in that project/workspace.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Xcode Version 6.2 (6C121) (but its been going on for a while)\r\n2. Open some workspace\r\n3. Command+Shift+T to open up a new window\r\n4. Make sure one window has the Toolbar showing, and one doesn't\r\n5. Close the window with the Toolbar showing\r\n6. Watch in despair as your other, innocent window is also horribly killed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would hope that only the window I meant to close would close. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll the windows are closed\r\nhttp://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/006/199/x-all-the-y.png\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C121)\r\nMac OS X 10.9.5 Build 13F34\r\nMacbook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is probably some convenience feature that someone thought was a good idea; but I don't really like it. Xcode is pretty cluttered as it is, so I try to keep things as minimal as possible, and often forget that I will close everything by closing one rogue window."
