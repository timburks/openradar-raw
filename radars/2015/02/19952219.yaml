    description: "Summary:\r\nThe HITheme button kThemePopUpButton reverts to the old Aqua appearance on Yosemite if its height is more than a standard amount, more than 22 pixels.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe problem is easily illustrated by the Tcl/Tk Aqua framework, which is bundled with OS X and which uses this API. However, the problem is not specific to Tcl/Tk; it is also visible in other apps that make use of the HITheme API. \r\n\r\n1. Save the code snippet below as kthemepopubuttonscript.tcl:\r\n\r\npack [ttk::menubutton .b -text \"Foo\"] -fill both -expand yes\r\nbind .b <Configure> {puts [winfo height .b]}\r\n\r\nRun the script with the Wish binary in Terminal:\r\n\r\n/usr/bin/wish kthemepopubuttonscript.tcl\r\n\r\n2.Wish will launch and display a kThemePopUpButton with \"Foo\" as its label text, looking consistent with the new Yosemite UI. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Resize the window. As the window is enlarged or reduced, the current height of the button will be displayed in the Terminal. \r\n\r\n4. When the button height exceeds 22 pixels, it will revert to the old glossy Aqua UI, not the modern flat Yosemite UI. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that the button will retain the flat Yosemite appearance, just with increased height. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the button height exceeds 22 pixels, it will revert to the old glossy Aqua UI, not the modern flat Yosemite UI."
