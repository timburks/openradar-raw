    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a large organization, managing the distribution certificates becomes fraught with peril the more people need to use it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create several projects, each of which has an entirely different team, all on one developer account.\r\n2. Discover that you need to modify the distribution certificate for one of the projects.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can modify the cert on a per-project basis.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou revoke the old cert and generate a new one. Now nobody on other projects can install old builds, since the certificate won't validate. You spend weeks hearing from other teams about their broken builds.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf we could specify additional distribution certificates on a per-app basis, rather than only per-organization, or if we were allowed more than two distribution certificates, this would be alleviated.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
