        Summary:
        There’s something funky going on with some of the handling of unicode variation selectors in emoji, and maybe in general? Basically the characters: ©®™‼⁉ are sometimes losing their variation selectors. I’ve included a playground that is able to illustrate the problem a lot better then I could here.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See attached code

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
