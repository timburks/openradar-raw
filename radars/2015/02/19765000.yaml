    description: "Summary:\r\nTwice now I've encountered an issue where FSEventStream is not calling our callback for notifications on writes within a directory. We use this in 1Password to get notified when a remote device has modified a sync'ed keychain in say Dropbox. \r\n\r\nOn my system when I saw this, it wasn't a specific directory that was causing me issues, it was any directory within my home folder (I didn't try anything outside of my home folder). This persisted through a reboot. Eventually, as I was screwing around and renaming directories that I was watching, things started working again.\r\n\r\nNow I've got a customer that's experiencing the same thing: https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/comment/180501/#Comment_180501\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build/Run the attached sample app\r\n2. Select a directory, such as ~/Desktop\r\n3. Write file to desktop\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect the sample app to show something in its little textview log.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNada. Silence.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.2 14C109\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect that this kind of issue would be hard to reproduce for you. If you could provide me with info to get from people who are experiencing this, this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nOne thing I tested with my system was that monitoring files via kqueue still worked. I considered switching us over to kqueue, but once things were working again the motivation there sort of died out. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIn my case this is a 2014 RMBP.\r\n\r\nSample App:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/312I1i0W2L1g"
