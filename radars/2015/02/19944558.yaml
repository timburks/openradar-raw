    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a bot that stopped working. All integrations fail immediately after a checkout with the following error:\r\n\r\nBot Issue: error. Build Service Error.\r\nIssue: missing delta bases (-1).\r\nIntegration Number: 44.\r\nIntegration URL: https://Toaster.local/xcode/bots/32CC89B/integrations\r\nDescription: missing delta bases (-1).\r\n\r\nI have created a new bot, configured to read from the same repo, and all integrations have failed in the same way.\r\n\r\nI am able to use git clone to fetch the repo (using the same credentials as I used in the new bot) and it completed successfully. I am also able to build the project using Xcode directly on the same server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Xcode Server\r\n2. Create a new bot from my project\r\n3. Run integration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect it to successfully download the repo and build the project.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt downloads about 18 MB of data (same as the repo size) and then fails. It does not appear to even attempt to compile the project. The log files (attached) do not contain much besides the error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\nOS X Server 4.0.3 (14S350)\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nForgot to mention: the error is accompanied by a \"Fix-It\" button. When I click this button, a new integration is started, and the same problem occurs. (Expected result: the problem is fixed.)"
