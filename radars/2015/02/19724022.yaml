    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLSession in iOS 8 can normally connect just fine to a server using the SPDY network protocol. However, if the server tries to push data using SPDY, the client app crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a sample server (e.g. in node.js) that accepts incoming requests using SPDY and sends back a response that includes server push data.\r\n2. Write a client app that uses NSURLSession to make a request to the server.\r\n3. Run the server.\r\n4. Run the app and initiate the connection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should properly receive the initial response and any data pushed to the server via SPDY.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes with the following message: \"Assertion failed: (stream != NULL), function cb_spdylay_on_stream_close, file /SourceCache/CFNetwork_Sim/CFNetwork-711.1.12/SPDY/SPDYConnection.cpp, line 1775.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince the server is running on my local box and the SSL certificate is self-signed, URLSession:didReceiveChallenge:completionHandler: is overridden to ignore the fact that the certificate is invalid.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4S, iPhone simulators\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
