        Summary:
        Working for different clients with many apps, I am lost in the provisioning profiles popup. It should only show the profiles of the selected team. And it should provide filtering as in the popups in the editor window.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have an Apple ID that has many provisioning profiles available for different customers / teams.

        Expected Results:
        Popup in Build Settings only shows those of the team, ordered by name, with a search field if you start typing.

        Actual Results:
        Huge list of unsorted (or sorted by last change, who knows) profiles

        Regression:
