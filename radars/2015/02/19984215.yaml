    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile interacting with HTML content using VoiceOver, line-by-line navigation fails; user cannot review plain text or long paragraphs line by line.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Turn VoiceOver on in OS X.\r\n\r\n2.  Navigate to any web page with any paragraph of text on it, or any plain text document.  Examples:\r\nhttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/26/microsoft_spartan_browser_rationale/\r\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt\r\n\r\n3.  Interact with any paragraph of text, or with the entire document body in case it's plain.\r\n\r\n4.  Try doing any review using just VO-Up and VO-Down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver should just indicate where the lines break naturally or deliberately, just as they are displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, you just hear the first line repeated for every attempted navigation; sometimes, especially for plain text, VoiceOver will read a completely unrelated part of the document, but still provide no useful navigation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was not a problem in Mac OS X 10.6.8; it has been introduced since then.\r\n\r\nAbout the only time I can reliably make the problem not occur is when reviewing preformatted text in pre HTML elements.  Weird, that.\r\n\r\nHave I identified this problem before?  Somehow, I almost feel sure that I must have.  Regardless, it is a longstanding issue.\r\n\r\nYosemite provides some mitigation, in the form of arrow-key navigation without the VO keys, and where VoiceOver reading the text under the cursor.  But that has issues of its own."
