    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile building a reduced sample to hunt a problem with restoration of a presented view controller, I ran into the following issue:\r\n\r\nWhen a view controller is presented using a segue, and dismissed using an unwind segue, it is impossible to dismiss the view controller after state restoration on the phone.\r\nOn iPad, the issue can be mitigated by setting `definesPresentationContext` of the master’s navigation controller to `YES` and the `modalPresentationStyle` to `currentContext` but on the phone, that navigation controller will not be in the hierarchy.\r\nAttempting to work around that issue by setting `definesPresentationContext` of another view controller to `YES` might result in the presentation to occur in a way, that the presented navigation controller’s bar is positioned under the other navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\niPad:\r\n1. Build and run the attached sample project on the iPad (simulator).\r\n2. tap the “+” button several times, and select one row.\r\n3. tap the “Do something” bar button item — a new navigation controller is presented over the detail navigation controller.\r\n4. verify that both bar button items, “Dismiss Me” and “Unwind” dismiss the presented controller.\r\n5. tap “Do something” once more, and kill the app using the launcher, in order to get state restoration.\r\n6. Launch again, and verify that the “unwind” bar button item works in the freshly restored state.\r\n\r\niPhone\r\n1. Build and run the attached sample project on the iPhone (simulator).\r\n2. tap the “+” button several times, and select one row.\r\n3. tap the “Do something” bar button item — a new navigation controller is presented over the detail navigation controller.\r\n4. verify that both bar button items, “Dismiss Me” and “Unwind” dismiss the presented controller.\r\n5. tap “Do something” once more, and kill the app using the launcher, in order to get state restoration.\r\n6. Launch again, and tap the “Unwind” button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn both kinds of devices, tapping the “Unwind” button in step 6 dismisses the presented view controller after state restoration.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the phone, you will find yourself stuck in the presented view controller, unless you tap on the “Dismiss me” bar button item.\r\nAfterwards, almost everything works as expected (apart from the fact that the previously selected cell is not un–highlighted on pop back to the root of the navigation stack, but that’s another issue…)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.1.1 (6A2008a) and included iOS 8.1 SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOn Xcode beta 6.3 State restoration appears to be completely borked:\r\nState is saved, but not restored on the simulator (and I’m not putting 8.3 on a device soon)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS 8 simulator will do, also iPad air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Restore.zip' was successfully uploaded."
