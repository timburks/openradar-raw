    description: "Summary:\r\nWith QuickNav turned on, the responsiveness of VoiceOver navigation is subtly, but noticeably, less than that of native VoiceOver commands, as performed using the VO keys, the commanders, or with the Control-Option lock.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Take any window.  Give it focus, and have VoiceOver on.\r\n\r\n2.  Use VoiceOver commands to navigate the window, especially by moving through it using VO-left and VO-right, or by interacting with any text, and using VO-up and VO-down.  If you have a commander set up, such as a numpad commander, you can use this also.\r\n\r\n3.  Make sure Quicknav is on.  Perform the exact same steps just using the arrow keys, with QuickNav on; that is, left and right, up and down.\r\n\r\n4.  Optionally, repeat step 1, and use the Control-Option-lock feature of VoiceOver to hold down the VO keys, so that you are still using just the arrows.\r\n\r\n5.  Optionally, use a text field and standard arrow-key navigation, and observe that it is not unlike the performance of standard VO commands, but is also substantially better than that of QuickNav.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nQuickNav should, from a performance point of view, be indistinguishable from the use of standard VO navigation commands or commanders, with or without Control-Option lock, or with text fields using standard arrow-key navigation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a slight, but noticeable, and highly aggravating loss of efficiency using QuickNav.  Productivity is hurt on a laptop keyboard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem has been around for a good long while now, and I suddenly realised that that's why I use a keyboard with a number pad, and numpad commander.  Without it--that is, on a Bluetooth keyboard or a notebook--the need for QuickNav is much more pronounced."
