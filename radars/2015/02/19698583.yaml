    description: "I have a WKInterfaceTable with cells that comprise of multiple labels or groups that are hidden dynamically. When hiding such elements, the cell frame is correctly resized but the table leaves an extra space to the next cell, so it doesn't reposition the cells. \r\n\r\nWhen pushing an interface controller and popping back, the extra spacing is gone even though the rows where cached and the row controller not being consulted. This is a regression from iOS 8.2 Beta 4."
