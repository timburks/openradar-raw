    description: "Sometimes it can be hard to unpick how a Storyboard works, especially if some view controllers are created programatically so they can be shared between multiple Storyboards.\r\n\r\nIt is also sometimes useful to be able to document what different segues do and when they are called.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore be useful if users could place reminder Stickes/Post It notes around the Storyboard to comment/document/provide visual reminder of how things work.\r\n\r\nObviously these items would be purely cosmetic and would not be included in the app itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Browse or search the Storyboard Object Library\r\n2. Locate the Sticky item\r\n3. Drag it to the required location in the Storyboard\r\n4. The Sticky becomes the first responder\r\n5. Type notes to go on the Sticky\r\n6. Click the background to finish."
