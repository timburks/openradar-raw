    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a project file includes two targest that specify a product with the same name, then the name should be differentitated such that it's obvious which one corresponds to which target.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached Test App.xcodeproj\r\n2. Expand the \"Products\" section.\r\n3. Observe there are two items named TestApp.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to differentiate by sight which product goes with the \"App 1\" target and which goes with \"App 2.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe items look identical.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, when you go to add a library to a \"Link with Libraries\" build phase, if there are duplicate products with the same name, Xcode differentiates them fully by listing both the project and target from which they originate.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the \"Products\" folder it would be enough to just differentiate them by target, since they are all known to belong to the same target.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.3 (6D520o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestAppSchemes.zip' was successfully uploaded."
