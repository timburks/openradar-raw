    description: "Summary:\r\nViews with IB_DESIGNABLE that are included in a static library in an Xcode project donâ€™t display their custom content in interface builder. This issue has been present in all versions of Xcode 6, including 6.3 Beta 1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add a UIView subclass to a static library included in an iOS project\r\n2) Mark the UIView subclass IB_DESIGNABLE\r\n3) Add an instance of that view to a nib/storyboard\r\n4) Notice the view does not draw \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view should draw correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view appears as an empty UIView\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSubclassing the view with no implementation in the main project and marking as IB_DESIGNABLE is sufficient to get the view to draw. The attached project includes two views in Main.storyboard: they both draw a 50x50 blue square in drawRect:. One is implemented in a static library, the other is an empty subclass in the main project. Only the empty subclass draws in interface builder, but both draw when the application is run."
