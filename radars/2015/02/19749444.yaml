        Summary:
        It used to be that Xcode (as of version 5 and earlier, I believe) would trim trailing spaces when you save the file you’re working on. Now it trails the spaces as soon as the cursor moves to a new line.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        (I’ll use a Swift example, but it happens for Swift and Objective-C code)
        1. In an open Xcode file, type “let x = “ (note the trailing space)
        2. Copy a variable name from elsewhere in the file
        3. Click to the right of the “=“ typed in step 1
        4. Paste the copied variable name
        5. Type on the next line: “let y = “
        6. Save the file

        Expected Results:
        The pasted variable name gets placed after the space typed originally, and the trailing space typed in step 5 gets removed after step 6

        Actual Results:
        The variable name gets pasted immediately next to the “=“ in step 4

        Regression:
        Xcode didn’t behave like this previously. I can’t remember whether it was Xcode 5 or 6 that introduced this behavior. I believe it was 6

        Notes:
        This is incredibly disruptive to the way I code, since my muscle memory has me type the “ = “ all at the same time, like I do in every other code editor
