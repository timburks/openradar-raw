    description: "Summary:\r\nLINE SEPARATOR (\\u2028) in NSAttributedString should not start new paragraphs, and NSParagraphStyle.paragraphSpacing should not be used between two lines separated by this character.\r\n\r\nRendering (in UILabel) doesn't respect this. Additionally, when adding a dummy attribute to the NSAttributedString, rendering is suddenly fixed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached project, with two UILabels with the same settings, same attributed string, except for one \"dummy\":\"dummy\" attribute.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOf course, both labels should render exactly the same, and the paragraph spacing should be ignored between two lines separated by LINE SEPARATOR (\\u2028).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSAttributedString without the dummy attribute isn't rendered correctly. There's unwanted space between the two lines separated by LINE SEPARATOR (\\u2028).\r\n\r\nThe NSAttributedString with the dummy attribute renders correctly. (!)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2, as well as iOS 8b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator 7/8beta2, iPod touch (8b2), iPhone 5 (7.1.2)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AttributedWTF.zip' and 'iOS Simulator Screen Shot 7 juil. 2014 09.30.51.png' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1K1a122F3z2k/download/AttributedWTF.zip"
