    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm partially sighted and struggle with low-contrast interfaces. Since iOS 7 I've struggled with various aspects of iOS's UI and despite reporting a couple of them I've seen no improvement in iOS 8. I'm hoping that some of these issues can be resolved in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nI also find issues with many third-party applications and it'd be fantastic if Xcode or the simulator provided tools to help developers ensure that their interfaces have sufficient contrast.\r\n\r\nThis is not an exhaustive list of low-contrast user interface elements, just the ones that come to mind.\r\n\r\n# Health.app\r\n\r\nThe graphs in Health.app are very low contrast. For example, my Body Fat Percentage graph is white text on a yellow-orange background, there's a top to bottom gradient from light to dark and the text at the top is *very* hard to read.\r\n\r\n# Messages.app\r\n\r\nThe green message bubbles also have a gradient with light green at the top and dark green at the bottom. I find the text at the bottom easy enough to read, but the text at the top, where the background is lighter, is difficult to read. A solid green of the colour at the bottom of each bubble would be much better.\r\n\r\n# Notification Center\r\n\r\nWhen General -> Accessibility -> Increase Contrast -> Reduce Transparency is enabled the No Events text in the Calendar widget becomes near impossible to read. Similarly the Today / Notifications labels are hard to read.\r\n\r\n# Notes.app\r\n\r\nYellow text and buttons on a white background result in a very difficult to read UI.\r\n\r\n# Weather.app\r\n\r\nWhen clouds are present, the UI can result in white text over white clouds."
