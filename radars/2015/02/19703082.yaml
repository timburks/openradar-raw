        Summary:

        If an attribute is marked as optional in the Core Data model, the generated Swift code will include it as a regular property. This leads to not being able to check if it is actually nil and can therefore lead to crashes at runtime as every access is treated as a force unwrap.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Create a an entity with the Core Data editor
        2. Add an attribute which is optional
        3. Generate code (Swift)

        Expected Results:

        The attribute should be a Swift optional typed property.

        Actual Results:

        The attribute will be a regularly typed property.
