    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS user experience would be enhanced were the system able to automatically adjust the white point (colour temperature) of the display in accordance with the local time and environmental lighting conditions.\r\n\r\nIn particular, after sunset, it is harsh to behold the iPhone display which generally emanates a blue hue relative to most incandescent interior lighting.\r\n\r\nOn the Mac, a fine utility exists called “Flux” (www.justgetflux.com) which handles this task seamlessly and to great subtle effect. It makes using the Mac at any time of day a much more pleasant experience.\r\n\r\niOS would benefit from similar such functionality. Apple is in a fortunate position to support this, given that this type of service is unavailable on a non-jailbroken device, and since furthermore it would be an innovative and competitive feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisplay white point is subtly warmer during post-sunset hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDisplay white point remains cool (6500+ K) at all times of day."
