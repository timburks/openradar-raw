    description: "Summary:\r\nSeveral teammates have downloaded Xcode 6.2 beta 5 and tried to open the project containing our WatchKit app, only to find that the simulators aren't listed - only \"My Mac\". It's then impossible to run the app that we've built (or even the iOS app that already existed).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPresumably, but we haven't been able to completely confirm the exact repro steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create iOS project in Xcode 6.2 beta 4 from one machine\r\n2. Add WatchKit target\r\n3. Check into source control\r\n4. Fresh install Xcode 6.2 beta 5 on another machine (don't already have had Xcode installed)\r\n5. Open the project\r\n6. Simulators are missing - only \"My Mac\" is listed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll iPhone simulators should be listed whenever we open the project file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo iPhone simulators are listed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta 5, OS X Yosemite 10.10.2"
