    description: "Swift structs containing more than 256 members result in a compiler crash.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for large structs generated by xcres to hold string constants for referencing resources.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift struct with 256 members\r\n2. Add a 257th member to the struct\r\n3. Let playground run or build project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFile should compile and the struct should be usable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe compiler crashes"
