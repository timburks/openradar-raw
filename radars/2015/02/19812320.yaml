    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached sample project that was created for rdar://19810729 does not restore any state when run in the simulator on Xcode 6.3 beta 1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached sample on Xcode 6.3 beta 1\r\n2. set up some state and kill the app through the launcher, so that state restoration info is written.\r\n3. restart the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou start where you left off, everything is fully functional, all data present\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou see the launch image, no state is restored, whatsoever.\r\nIf you set any breakpoints in the app delegate callbacks they are not hit, even though the serialization callbacks have all been called during app shutdown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.3 (6D520o)\r\nSimulator Version 8.3 (SimulatorApp-565.6 CoreSimulator-117.13)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not happen on Xcode 6.1.1 (6A2008a) or its simulators.\r\nDoes not happen on Xcode 6.2 (6C121) or its simulators\r\nDoes not happen when built on Xcode 6.3 (6D520o) but run on hardware running 8.1.3 (12B466)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Restore.zip' was successfully uploaded."
