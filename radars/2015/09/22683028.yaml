        Summary:
        UIKit does not automatically adjust content insets when table view added programmatically in viewDidLoad.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a custom subclass of UIViewController
        2. Create UITableView within custom UIViewController subclass and add it as subview within viewDidLoad method
        3. Add UINavigationController in Storyboard and make it initial controller.
        4. Add UIViewController in storyboard and assign it custom class created on step 1
        5. Set earlier created view controller as root view controller of navigation controller
        6. Run the app and observe that table view does not receive the content inset adjustments to accommodate navigation bar.

        Expected Results:
        Automatically adjusted content inset of UITableView

        Actual Results:
        Content inset is not automatically adjusted for UITableView

        Regression:
        It does not occur on iOS 8 or earlier versions. Content insets were always automatically adjusted for the first scrollview-based subview.
