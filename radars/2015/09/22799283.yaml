    description: "Summary:\nThe “Reload All Tabs” contextual menu entry for  tabs, which was present since time immemorial, is now missing from Safari 9.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open contextual menu of a tab of a Safari window. \n2. Try to click a menu entry which is not there.\n3. Panic.\n\nExpected Results:\nObserve the calming effect of opening a tab’s contextual menu and finding at least the entries you are used to (especially “Reload All Tabs”)\n\nActual Results:\nPanic due to having to reload each and every tab manually or having to write an AppleScript yet again to fill the gap. \n\nRegression:\nWorks fine in Safari up to and including version 8. Disappeared in 9.\n\nNotes:\nPlease bring this menu entry back!"
