    description: |-
        The processing time of prerelease builds is just too long(in my case 6+ hours) to tolerate. It is totally unacceptable. It has single-handed destroyed iterative software development cycles for app developers.

        Let’s do some math:
        * Feature development & bug fix: 4~8 hours
        * TestFlight Processing: 6 ~ ∞ hours

        It it hardly possible to do one release per day which is the minimum requirement for a usable Testing & Distribution system.

        It is not an issue that should be “resolved” case by case, every time, by time. I, and many others, just don’t have enough time and patience for this. It should be systematically resolved, once for all.

        Please pay due attention to this issue because it is making so many of us suffering.
