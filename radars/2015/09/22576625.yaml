    description: "Summary:\nWhen you access a playlist from an iTunes share, you cannot scroll the playlist.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open iTunes on two macs on your local network where you have personal sharing activated\n2. on one mac open the shared library of the other mac.\n3. Click on the Playlist button to see the playlists of the shared library\n4. click on a playlist with more than 10 tracks.\n5. try to scroll below the last visible track (make your window smaller if you see all tracks already)\n\nExpected Results:\nwould be super useful to being able to access all the tracks \n\nActual Results:\nthe view containing the list seems to scroll, not the list itself\n\nRegression:\nthis bug had worked in previous versions."
