    description: "Summary:\r\nThe icon representing that a song/album is available offline is not consistent. When an album is saved offline, the icon shows up on the album artwork on the album page. While still in that album’s page, some songs will display the available offline icon while other songs are completely hidden from the list until you tap ‘Show Complete Album’. Furthermore, the songs that do not display the available offline icon have the option to ‘Make Available Offline’ despite the fact that I can already listen to them without a connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Save ‘The Real Slim Shady’ (individual song from the album) for offline listening.\r\n2. Save ‘The Marshall Mathers LP’ (entire album) for offline listening.\r\n3. Go to the album page for ‘The Marshall Mathers LP’.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll songs should have the available offline icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly ‘The Real Slim Shady’ has the available offline icon.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe issue with the entire album not showing does not occur with shorter albums.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAll songs in the album are in fact available for offline listening (expected) but the UI does not reflect this causing confusion."
