        Summary:
        iOS 9 violates RFC 7465 by offering RC4 as cipher

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Connect to a test service (web server, mail server, XMPP,  etc.) that only offers RC4 cipher suits.

        Expected Results:
        TLS Handshake must fail.

        Actual Results:
        OS X happily connects with an insecure cipher suite which use violates TLS standards 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.

        Regression:
        This should have been fixed in earlier OS X releases already, but is still present in OS X 10.10.x public release and 10.11 betas.

        Notes:
        RFC 7465
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7465

        TLS clients MUST NOT include RC4 cipher suites in the ClientHello message.
        TLS servers MUST NOT select an RC4 cipher suite when a TLS client sends such a cipher suite in the ClientHello message.
