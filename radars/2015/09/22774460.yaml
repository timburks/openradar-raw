        Summary:
        Pasting text into a UISearchController does not enable the return key on the keyboard in a UISearchController's UISearchBar. Essentially, enablesReturnKeyAutomatically is ignored, as this property should be YES by default.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Let UISearchBar of a UISearchController become first responder.
        2. Paste text into UISearchBar
        3. Press Search button on keyboard

        Expected Results:
        Search button is enabled.

        Actual Results:
        Search button is disabled.

        Notes:
        Project attached. "Paste Me!" is added to pasteboard and focus on UISearchBar is set automatically. Simply long-press and paste. Search button is disabled.
