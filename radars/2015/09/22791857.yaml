    description: "Summary:\r\nNSScrollView does not scroll horizontally when its hasHorizontalScroller is set to false. The documentation indicates that this property only controls the visibility/existence of a horizontal scroller, not the NSScrollView's ability to scroll horizontally altogether.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create NSScrollView with documentView that should be horizontally scrollable\r\n2. Set hasHorizontalScroller = false\r\n3. Build and run, attempt to scroll horizontally\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSScrollView scrolls horizontally, but does not show horizontal scroller\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSScrollView does not scroll horizontally at all\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A282b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf this is the intended behavior—which, if it is the case, is severely limiting—the hasHorizontalScroller property is severely misnamed and the documentation wholly incorrect. \"canScrollHorizontally\" would be a more appropriate name in that case."
