        Summary:
        While watching a video on an iPad while it is charging with Hey Siri turned on, it can randomly activate if the video says something close to the phrase “Hey Siri”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Turn on Hey Siri
        2. Plug in iPad
        3. Start watching a video that says something close to Hey Siri, One phrase I saw is “I seriously Doubt” while watching Stargate atlantis.

        1. Siri does not recognize this phrase and the video keeps playing on the iPad playing the video.

        Actual Results:
        1. All my plugged in devices, including the device playing the video activate siri.
