        Summary:
        Quite often, even on a good network, Apple Music playback is slightly choppy. There are a-few-millisecond long discontinuities in playback roughly every 15s when it’s bad. This is surprisingly jarring and makes it almost painful to listen to music.

        This clip is recorded over USB, which is not a great reproduction of actual playback (it seems to interpolate and compensate for a slow incoming stream or something?), but you can clearly see the discontinuity at the 0’04,2562 mark.

        From the screenshot, it looks like it’s fading in for a duration of 60ms, which I would interpret as a bug in the code that manages fading in after buffering.

        The track being played is Through the Blue by Roger Eno on Voices.

        Here’s a longer clip with more discontinuities (can’t reproduce them in the sound editor): https://www.dropbox.com/s/vxagy1p3she09r8/discontinuity.mov?dl=0
