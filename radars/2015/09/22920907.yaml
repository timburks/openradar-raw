    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the latest version of Xcode 7 - 7.0.1 installed from the App Store, Xcode 7 completely ignores the 'Automatically insert closing braces' option.\r\n\r\nIn previous releases this was not the case, and the editor would automatically insert closing braces for me.\r\n\r\nNow instead of that it refuses to do any auto-completion of braces, making code editing incredibly fiddly and time consuming. I'm having to use an unofficial IDE as I rely on this feature to edit my code fluently.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen any project, notice that regardless of the setting Xcode 7.0.1 does not auto-complete braces.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAuto completion to work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't at all...\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEl Capitan Build 15A282b, Xcode 7.0.1 via App Store\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTesting on a Macbook Pro 12,1"
