    description: "If the user chooses to show only music that is stored on the iPhone (a perfectly legitimate and viable configuration) then the music app displays a permanent banner taking 7% of the phone's entire screen area, which cannot be removed nor dismissed - except by changing configuration in a way that the user has already demonstrated they do not want.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Settings > Music, turn off \"Show Apple Music\" \r\n2. In Music, go to the \"My Music\" tab\r\n3. At the top of the list of music, click the heading of the list \"Artists\", \"Songs\" etc\r\n4. Turn on the option \"Only Offline Music\" (subtitled: \"Show only music stored on this iPhone\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bar would not be shown, or at least could be dismissed by a swipe or hitting an \"x\" button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bar is shown permanently.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A344)"
