    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have no way to check the integrity of any developer tools downloaded from apple.com. In lieu of things like XcodeGhost (http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/apple-scrambles-after-40-malicious-xcodeghost-apps-haunt-app-store/), there should be a list of strong cryptographic hashes for all developer tools downloads. This list should be signed with Apple’s PGP key (https://www.apple.com/support/security/pgp/).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDownload anything from the developer portal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDevelopers should be able to verify the integrity of the download in a cryptographically secure manner.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWe assume everything is fine. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \r\n\r\nRegression: -\r\nNotes: -"
