    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading to Xcode 7, Xcode never finishes its 'Scanning for Working Copies' task for my workspace. One interesting item of note is that my workspace contains many nested Git Submodules.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 7\r\n2. Open a Workspace\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should find all Working Copies contained within my workspace. All working copies should be visible under the Source Control menu. This task took a few seconds in Xcode 6.4.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode 7 reports that it is 'Scanning for Working Copies' and no Working Copies are listed under the Source Control menu."
