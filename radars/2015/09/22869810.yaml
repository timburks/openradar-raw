    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an alphanumeric passphrase is set for the phone, replying to a third party message through Quick Reply on the lock screen does not bring up the keyboard after the passphrase or Touch ID is used to sign in to the phone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock your phone.\r\n2. Receive a message from a third party messenger.\r\n3. Swipe on the message from the lock screen and press Reply.\r\n4. Authenticate using a passphrase or Touch ID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iOS keyboard will be displayed and the user is able to reply to the message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iOS keyboard will not display and the user is unable to reply to the message.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1 [13A405]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI used Telegram in order to test this issue as no other third-party messengers appear to support Quick Reply. This problem does not occur if the phone lacks a passcode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S, iPhone 6+, and iPhone 5S\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Telegram Quick Reply with Passphrase.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
