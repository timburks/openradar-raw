    description: "Summary:\r\nLocking the phone while on the map view of Frequent Location in Settings.app, and then unlocking the phone and either tapping back or swiping back from the left screen edge, seemingly breaks the view hierarchy, and trying to tap back in the top left or swipe all the way back to Settings.app leaves the navigation bar broken.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings.app\r\n2. Go to Privacy > Location Services > System Services > Frequent Locations\r\n3. Tap on a city\r\n4. Lock the device, then unlock the device\r\n5. Try to go back in the view hierarchy, via swiping back or tapping \"back\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view navigates back and the navigation bar updates accordingly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe navigation bar state seems to get stuck, and after the animation of sliding + fading the current bar button items towards the right, it jumps back to the state it was on in the map view.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB"
