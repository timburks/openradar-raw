    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg symlink is locked by System Integrity Protection (SIP) and cannot be modified.\r\n\r\nBeing able to change this file will allow an admin to change the default picture for the machine.\r\n\r\nIn my testing, I was not able to delete /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg or move it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to /System/Library/CoreServices in Finder.\r\n\r\n2. Attempt to manipulate /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg (rename symlink, remove symlink). File is locked.\r\n\r\n4. Do same process in Terminal. Even as sudo, permission denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould be able to rename or delete /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg symlink, or replace with different .jpg file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCannot modify symlink or replace with a different .jpg file.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe use case for this change is to allow the customization of the default desktop background. This is used by a number of companies, schools and institutions to set a branded or otherwise custom desktop background for their users."
