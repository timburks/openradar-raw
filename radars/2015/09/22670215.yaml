        Summary:
        Only builds archived with GM versions of Xcode are allowed to be submitted to TestFlight, but this is extremely limiting.
        If TestFlight wants to establish itself as the de facto build system, it needs to become more flexible. I refuse to use other systems (like Fabric, HockeyApp, etc), because A: I have to deal with device UUIDs, and B: running the app through that is not production environment, so it makes it harder to test things like IAP, Push Notifications, etc. Not to mention that you can’t install Watch apps, and probably the same for Apple TV apps.

        If we, as developers, want to release quality and bug-free apps, we need to be able to test them from the early stages, not just during the very last week.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create an iOS project with the latest Xcode Beta (7.1 Beta at the time of writing this bug).
        - Try to submit to TestFlight for Internal and External testing.

        Expected Results:
        - Build is accepted and can be used for Internal and External testing, though of course it can’t be submitted for review yet.

        Actual Results:
        - Build is rejected (see screenshot).

        Notes:
        In particular, I’m unable to archive apps using Xcode 7 GM right now (radars 22392501 and 22183332). Those are fixed in 7.1, and I’m already using this version to build my app, but not being able to deploy to TestFlight until who knows when is very frustrating.
