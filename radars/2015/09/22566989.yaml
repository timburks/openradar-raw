    description: "A white square appears right over the Date Picker View.   This started happening when I updated the app to run for iOS 9.  Build and run the attached project or see the screenshot to actually see the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlace a UIDatePickerView inside a cell in a table view, using Interface Builder.  Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShow a normal UIDatePickerView\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nShow a UIDatePickerView with a strange white square over it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS 9 build\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI got to the conclusion that it was an iOS bug and not an issue in my code when I saw that the 'strange' view was inside the UIDatePickerView.
