        systemsetup command line tool does not allow you to select Windows/Bootcamp volumes.  With the introduction of System Integrity Protection (SIP), you cannot select a Windows volume with the bless tool.  systemsetup currently allows you to select a startup drive with “-setstartupdisk” but returns with an error when trying to select a Windows/Bootcamp volume:

        >sudo systemsetup -setstartupdisk /Volumes/Untitled
        >Not a System Folder: /Volumes/Untitled/System/Library/CoreServices

        I would expect the same behavior as selecting the volume in Startup Disk, where you can select either OS X or Bootcamp volumes.

        The bless command also has additional options such as “nextonly” and select by device that should be supported by systemsetup -setstartupdisk as well.
