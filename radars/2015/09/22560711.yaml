    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd like my content blockers to be able to block tracking cookies, while letting the browser be able to log in to protected web sites, use shopping carts and  other things that are usually provided by session cookies. In addition, I'd like to have the ability to only accept Secure and/or HttpOnly cookies.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I'd like to be able to target specific cookies based on the existence (or lack of) specific keys.\r\n\r\nI've attached an JSON file that illustrates an example blocking action that should block all cookies that:\r\n1. Either has the keys \"Expires\" or \"Max-Age\", aka. a non-session cookie\r\n2. Does not have both keys \"Secure\" and \"HttpOnly\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, OS X 10.11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDevices running iOS 9 or OS X 10.11\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'example.json':\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"action\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"block-cookies\",\r\n      \"cookie-keys\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"if-contains\": [\r\n            \"Expires\",\r\n            \"Max-Age\"\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"unless-contains\": [\r\n            \"Secure\"\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"unless-contains\": [\r\n            \"HttpOnly\"\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"trigger\": {\r\n      \"url-filter\": \".*\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]"
