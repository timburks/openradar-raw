    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an app that is opened in Slide Over mode uses openURL to open the current full-screen app, the app is called again with the same url when it is invoked at a later time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n- open app A regularly on an iPad\r\n- swipe from the right side of the screen to open app B in a Slide Over mode over app A\r\n- let app B call app A using [UIApplication openURL:]\r\n- now app A is opened and the app delegate is supplied with the URL and the Slide Over is gone\r\n- tap the home button to switch to the home screen\r\n- open app A again from the home screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the app delegate of app A should not be called again with the same URL\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- app A is opened and the app delegate is supplied AGAIN with the same URL as in the previous openURL call\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt only seems to occur when the Slide Over app uses openURL to call the current full-screen app. It does not seem to happen if another app is currently in full-screen mode below the Slide Over. It also happens when using the multitasking switcher or multitasking gestures to switch away from and back to app A.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere is a concrete example with the existing apps \"Working Copy\" and \"Textastic\" where this behavior causes data loss for the user:\r\n\r\n- open Textastic in fullscreen mode on an iPad\r\n- use the file action \"Edit in Textastic\" from Working Copy in Slide Over mode\r\n- Textastic is called with a \"replace\" x-callback-url call. It sends the contents of the file from Working Copy to Textastic and saves it in a local file and then opens the file.\r\n- make changes to the file in Textastic\r\n- tap the home button to switch to the home screen\r\n- open Textastic from the home screen\r\n- now iOS calls Textastic *again* with the same \"replace\" x-callback-url call and the user's changes are lost"
