    description: "Summary:\r\nRequests made using NSURLSession when running on watchOS 2 are very slow. Loading the same content via NSData vs.  NSURLSession can often result in a difference of 5-10x in the load time. This is causing various issues throughout our app, as well as a very poor user experience, as the time to complete tasks can be 5-10x longer than the same app running on watchOS 1.\r\n\r\nResults of running this test app can be found in the ReadMe.md file of the attached sample code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached sample project \"urlTest\"\r\n2. Build and run urlTest WatchKit App target\r\n3. Press the button to run the test\r\n4. Times to load the test URL are displayed on screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRequests made using NSURLSession on watchOS 2 should be comparable to the performance on watchOS 1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPerformance is very poor, leading to a poor user experience, depending on the amount of URL requests that need to be made by the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApple Watch Simulator Version 2.0 (SimulatorApp-621 CoreSimulator-179)\r\nXcode Version 7.0 (7A220)\r\n\r\nSample code can also be found at: https://github.com/joshbuhler/urlTest"
