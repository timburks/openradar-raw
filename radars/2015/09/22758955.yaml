    description: "Summary:\r\nOS X Server 5.0.3 is not recognizing itself as being compatible to itself and can't connect to itself claiming I should upgrade to a newer version.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Server 4.1.5, Upgrade to Server 5.0.3 via App Store. Try to login to Server.app. Either it complely fails to authenticate or it complains that it is not compatible with itself.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLaunchign server.app should work to migrate services.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWTFMoments, see screenshot. All services down, no way to run them again. Downgrading to 4.1.5 not possible as well.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhy doesn't Apple just stop making fun of their customers and officially end Server and OS X? The bad quality forced upon us can only be described as comically sick. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNew mini, 10.10.5, Server 4.1.5 just upgraded to 5.0.3 in the hope that it would be less unusable that 4.1.5. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Remote Desktop Picture 18 Sep 2015 18.22.16 CEST.png' was successfully uploaded."
