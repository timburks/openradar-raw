    description: "Summary:\r\nDefine a UIView in a XIB file, mark it as IBDesignable, then instantiate it in a Storyboardâ€™s view, and it still shows up as a blue box, rather than previewing what the view will look like in context\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project\r\n2. Edit Main.storyboard\r\n3. Click Editor > Refresh All Views\r\n4. Build and run (in a simulator)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDuring #2, you can see the images of the boots in Interface Builder, or at least in the IB Preview for a device, or #3 would fix it, if not. You also see the boots when running in the simulator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou see the boots in the simulator, but only a blue box in IB, and #3 makes no difference"
