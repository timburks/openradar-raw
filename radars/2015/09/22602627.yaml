    description: "Summary:\r\n“Cold Calling”, phone and text-based spam and scams, and nuisance calls are, unfortunately, all too common now-a-days.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 9 and Safari 9, apps were given the create content blockers which prevent unwanted javascript and other resources from loading, allowing users with the tool enabled, to browse the web without fear of being tracked by third parties, and without intrusive ads ruining the mobile web.\r\n\r\nWhen a nuisance phone call comes through, however, the entire interface is taken over by the call.\r\n\r\nContent Blockers could be expanded to include blocking calls, text messages, and/or FaceTime calls.\r\n\r\nBlocked calls should show in the “Recents” tab in the Phone app, and be displayed with an icon highlighting that the call was blocked.\r\n\r\nFor messages, a new tab could be displayed next to “Unknown Senders” (Assuming the option to “Filter Unknown Senders” is enabled in Settings » Messages).\r\n\r\nWhether the Phone or Messages apps should receive a badge for blocked calls or messages should be left up to the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a nuisance phone call.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the number matches the block list, the call should be blocked, and not interrupt the user, however, it should still display in “Recents”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user is interrupted by a call, and must take action to dismiss it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4.1 (12H321)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsers can already block calls, however, that requires a call to come in first, and the user to manually block the call. Predefined or community block lists are not possible.\r\n\r\nUsers can also filter iMessages from unknown senders, but this only applies to iMessage, not regular SMS.\r\n\r\nThere’s also an argument to be made as to whether a phone call deserves to completely take over the display any more, and whether it should actually just display as any other notification."
