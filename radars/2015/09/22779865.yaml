        Summary:
        Certificates can't be configured anymore for Calendar/Contacts

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Server.ap 5.0.3, go to certificates then try to configure a certificate for Calendar/Contacts to use.

        Expected Results:
        There should be an entry for Contacts and Calendar Server for which cert these services should use.

        Actual Results:
        There is no entry for Calendar/Contacts at all anymore. It's completely gone.

        Regression:
        This still worked in Server 4.1.5.
        The Servces TLS is beyond horribly insecure. It does not meet Apple's own App Transport Security requirements.

        Notes:
        Neither Calendar nor Contacts service can be launched at all due to a bug in XPC config generated by Server.app.
        No data of these services can be accessed before an Update to fix this issue is provided by Apple effectively resulting in a complete denial of service.
