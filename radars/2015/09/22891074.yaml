    description: "Summary:\r\nPodcast episode titles with ampersands appear to be cut off in the Podcast app. This appears to be a new iOS 9 issue since older versions of the Podcast app did not have this issue.\r\n\r\nCharacters before the \"&\" character is missing. Characters after the ampersand displays correctly.\r\n\r\nOther podcast apps such as Pocket Casts display episode titles with ampersands correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subscribe to a show with ampersands in the episode titles (e.g. http://podcasts.todaynetwork.com.au/rss/labby-stav-and-abby-show.rss)\r\n2. Go to Feed listing\r\n3. Titles of episodes with ampersands will be cut off\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe title of episodes should display in full\r\n\"STAV & ABBY - SEPTEMBER MONDAY 28\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe title of the episode is cut off before the ampersand\r\n\"& ABBY - SEPTEMBER MONDAY 28\""
