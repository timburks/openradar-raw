    description: "My watch app is easily capable of reading live heart rate data from HealthKit's new updateHandler in HKAnchoredObjectQuery.\r\n\r\nTrouble is, the health store that the phone app observes seems to be unsynchronized with the watch.\r\n\r\nSuspending the app and resuming it will sometimes prompt HealthKit to do (what seems to be) a synchronization between the watch's health store and the phone's store. I don't know why that is, but it suggests there is some internal initiation for the sync.\r\nWhat I need is a method in the API that simply asks HealthKit to do that. \r\n\r\nThis is a major problem because it renders HealthKit an unreliable single location to read and write health data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Use an HKAnchoredObjectQuery on the watch for collecting heart rate, same as in the WatchOS2 presentation demo.\r\n\r\n2) Implement the same query on the companion app on the iPhone. Display the latest heart rate like the watch app.\r\n\r\n3) Run the watch app in the XCode simulator. Open the companion app for displaying what the phone sees as \"live heart rate.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI don't necessarily expect the steps above to achieve live heart rate on the phone, but an API method to periodically re-sync the Health Store would.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Watch app returns new heart rate data while the companion app fails. If you open the Health app on the phone, and then return to the companion app, it will re-sync and show the latest heart rate momentarily.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS SDK 9.0 GM"
