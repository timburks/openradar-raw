        I was able to back up my iPad Air 2 to iCloud yesterday after being unable to get it to work throughout the iOS 9 beta cycle. To get it “unstuck”, I turned off iCloud backups in iTunes and synced, then turned off iCloud backups on the device itself through Settings -> iCloud -> Backups. Then I reenabled everything and this time the backup worked.

        Unfortunately, the device wasn’t able to do an incremental backup overnight, and I’ve been able to reproduce the problem with Xcode attached. The console log is attached - look around 10:45am.

        The issue seems to be something to do with encryption keys. There are multiple warnings about OTA keybags not matching current keybags, and the final barf message for the backup seems to be “1 files are missing encryption keys”.
