    description: "Summary:\r\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA native app is installed on the device that is programmed to be able to open a custom URL scheme.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClicking a URL scheme from a web page should open up the native app configured with the custom URL scheme.\r\n\r\nWe’ve tried several ways to use this custom URL scheme.\r\n1. Using window.location: \r\nThe javascript code looks like this:\r\nwindow.location = ‘<custom-protocol>://XYZ’\r\n \r\n2. Using an iFrame\r\nThe javascript code (using jQuery) looks like this:\r\n$('<iframe/>')\r\n.attr('src', '<custom-protocol>://XYZ')\r\n.attr('style', 'display:none')\r\n.appendTo('body'); \r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn iOS9 it won’t open the native app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPrior to iOS 9\r\n1. Using window.location: This resulted in the native app showing up right away (no popups).\r\n2. Using an iFrame: This resulted in the native app showing up right away (no popups).\r\n\r\nIn iOS 9:\r\n \r\n1. Using window.location: This resulted in an alert popping up that asks a user whether they would like to open the app within the native app. The two buttons on the popup are “Open” & Cancel”. Tapping “Open” opens up the native app. Tapping “Cancel” dismisses the popup.\r\n2. Using an iFrame: Nothing happens at all. No popups or app opening.\r\n \r\nNotes:\r\n1. Both approaches (window.location & iFrame) work when running within a Chrome browser on iOS 9, but with the same popup as mentioned above.\r\n2. We’ve tried adding a whitelist (LSApplicationQueriesSchemes) within the app, but get the same behavior as described above for iOS 9."
