        I find many applications in the iOS app store that have slipped violations of app store review guidelines past review. However, there is no obvious way to report them, so all I can do is put up with their violations and hope they're not malicious, or uninstall them. Please offer a mechanism to report e.g. the following violation:

        5.6 Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising, promotions, or direct marketing of any kind
        	E.g. the Masters of the Universe side-scroller that was out a year or two ago sent advertising and reminders to people to keep playing the game.

        It would also be nice if it was possible to report applications that significantly alter behaviour after release (e.g. the paid Plants vs. Zombies 1 adding huge interstitial advertisements at the release of PvZ 2).
