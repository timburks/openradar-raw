    description: "Summary:\nBitcode presents compelling, forward-looking opportunities on iOS, but it currently precludes the use of our well-established in-house or third-party crash reporting tools. We will not willingly sacrifice either our company’s capabilities, or HockeyApp’s excellent crash-reporting interface, both of which are invaluable for our workflows. \n\niTunes Connect’s crash data is inaccessible to automation, and less effective at identifying crashes than PLCrashReporter (as attested by crashprobe.com). iTC’s crash reporting solves no problems for us, and my organization prefers to have nothing to do with it.\n\nWe could easily adapt our tools if Apple provided the dSYMs for the recompiled binaries they create on developers’ behalf. Providing this data would be a welcome indicator of Bitcode’s growing maturity. \n\nThanks for your time."
