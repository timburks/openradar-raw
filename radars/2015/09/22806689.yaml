    description: "Summary:\r\nA node's parent is shuffled inside a block. Starting with the next event loop, it will always report its parent as nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Inside a block, remove a node from its parent and add it to another parent.\r\n2. Enumerate through the children of the new parent in the next event loop.\r\n3. The child will report its parent as nil, although it remains on the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe actual parent (in the example project, tempNode) should be reported.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe parent property is nullified. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 (13A344)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is probably related to bug 22803714. The issue does not occur on iOS 8."
