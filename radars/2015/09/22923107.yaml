    description: "Summary:\r\nDevelopers frequently forget to bump a build number before doing an Archive and Upload to iTunes Connect.  It would save a ton of time of the “Upload to App Store” action began with a sanity check, and just remind the user if they’ve previously uploaded a build with the same build number before actually uploading the whole thing.  A typical archive and upload is about ten minutes for me, and I know many others who suffer longer due to large projects or slower internet.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUpload a build.  Write code.  Upload again, forgetting to bump the build number.  Wait a long time.  Receive error.  Cry.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpload a build.  Write code.  Upload again, forgetting to bump the build number.  Wait seconds, get an error that build number is already in use.  Smile.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA long wait.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPerfection would be actually checking with iTunes Connect, but I’d be happy with just checking locally (i.e. against the list of archives stored on the same machine)."
