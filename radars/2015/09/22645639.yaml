    description: "Summary:\r\n+ [NSLocale preferredLanguages] languages are prefixed by the country code when running on iOS but not when running on OS X.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached sample projects where we set the text (iOS) and string (OS X) properties to the same value,  \"preferredLanguages: \\(NSLocale.preferredLanguages())”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the “NSLocale preferredLanguages - iOS” project.\r\n2. Build and run the “NSLocale preferredLanguages - OS X” project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n+ [NSLocale preferredLanguages] should behave in a similar fashion on both platforms.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe languages from the iOS project are prefixed with the current locale’s country code ( NSLocale.currentLocale().objectForKey(NSLocaleCountryCode)) while on OS X they are not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan GM, Xcode 7 GM, iOS 9 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe rely on + [NSLocale preferredLanguages] in our shared code between the Mac and the iOS app. And we expect that + [NSLocale preferredLanguages] does behave in a similar fashion on both platforms.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 8.4.1 + [NSLocale preferredLanguages] does not append the country code to the preferred language.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X El Capitan GM on an Early 2015 13 inch rMBP, iOS 9 GM on an iPhone 6.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NSLocale preferredLanguages.zip' was successfully uploaded. https://com-agilebits-users.s3.amazonaws.com/rad/NSLocale%20preferredLanguages.zip"
