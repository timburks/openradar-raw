    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, it's impossible to access built-in system audio units (such as the reverb unit) from within Audio Unit Extensions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll iOS 9 betas\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is absolutely critical functionality. Without it, a very significant portion of existing apps will not be ported to the new system, because their developers would otherwise need to write their own replacements for the system audio units, which is generally impractical.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
