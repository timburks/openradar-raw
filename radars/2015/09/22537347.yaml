    description: "Summary:\r\nI perform unit tests on my project with a designated app delegate class, different from my regular app delegate . The UnitTestAppDelegate is not a member of the app target, only of the test target.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 6 it is working, the correct delegate is used, But in Xcode 7 (beta 6) the app crashes when trying to load to test delegate. I test using simulators, both iOS 8 and 9.\r\n\r\nSee more info on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32349140/unit-tests-with-designated-appdelegate-crashes-on-xcode-7\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload repo from https://github.com/ashavit/UnitTests-Different-AppDelegate and run test (cmd+u).\r\nXcode 7 crashes.\r\nXcode 6 runs.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn regular build & run first console line should be: \"AppDelegate: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions\"\r\nOn test build, tests should succeed, and first console line should be: \"TestAppDelegate: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn test build, app crashes on main.m file\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
