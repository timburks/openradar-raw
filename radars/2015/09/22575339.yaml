        Summary:

        There appears to be incorrect information in the following Apple knowledgebase article:

        Prepare for NetBoot, NetInstall, and NetRestore requirements in OS X El Capitan
        https://support.apple.com/HT205054


        The section with the error is below:


        ----

        Add a trusted NetBoot server

        The System Integrity Protection feature of OS X El Capitan requires that you tell your Mac to trust the NetBoot server. You can do that by using the Bless NetBoot Server action in the System Image Utility app, or by using the bless command-line tool.

        ----

        The last sentence includes this part:

        "...using the bless command-line tool." That seems to be incorrect, as bless is not able to tell the Mac to trust the NetBoot server. The correct way to tell the Mac to trust the NetBoot server should be to use the new csrutil tool:

        "...using the csrutil command-line tool."


        With that change, the section should now read as follows:

        ----

        Add a trusted NetBoot server

        The System Integrity Protection feature of OS X El Capitan requires that you tell your Mac to trust the NetBoot server. You can do that by using the Bless NetBoot Server action in the System Image Utility app, or by using the csrutil command-line tool.
