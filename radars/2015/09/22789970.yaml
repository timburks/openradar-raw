    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous iOS versions, the Task Switcher provided an easy means to quickly \"peek\" at another app, e.g., to reference information while working in another app.\r\n\r\nAlthough solutions such as slide-over and side-by-side can be helpful for viewing two apps at the same time, this takes more work to set up (i.e., selecting the previous app in the slide-over viewer) and dedicates the selected app to the view, once selected, which may be unwanted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Double-tap Home button to launch task switcher\r\n2. Swipe left to find window to reference\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce found, window is fully viewable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnce found, window is only partially viewable. Nudging left or right to ease the screen into full view is practically impossible because as you reach the edge of the window, the next app window snaps into place."
