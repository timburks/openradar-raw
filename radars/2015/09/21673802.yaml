    description: "I tried to add a search bar in a UICollectionView as a UICollectionReusableView. \r\nWhen you activate the search bar by tapping on it, and cancel it using the cancel button or by scrolling, doing this multiple times results in the app crashing inside the UIResponder.\r\n\r\nHere is an example project: http://techprimate.com/CollectionViewResponderCrash.zip\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the example project\r\n2. Run the project on the Simulator or iPhone 5S using iOS 8\r\n3. Tap on the search bar\r\n4. Tap on \"cancel\"\r\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 four five times until app crashes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the app not to crash when using the search bar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes inside the UIResponder\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H141)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI already discussed the problem with other developers on the website stackoverflow.com:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/q/31098831/3515302?sem=2\r\n\r\nThe search algorithm is not implemented yet!\r\n\r\nThe example project includes a short video showing the error\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S 16 GB & Simulator\r\n\r\n--- Apple ---\r\n\r\nDo you see any difference in behavior in the latest iOS 9 beta?  Does the issue still reproduce exactly the same? \r\n\r\nPlease test with this release.  If you still have issues, please provide any relevant logs or information that could help us investigate.\r\n\r\niOS 9\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/ios/download/\r\n\r\n--- Apple ---\r\nDo you see any difference in behavior in the latest iOS 9 beta?
