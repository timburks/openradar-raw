    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading my watch to watchOS 2, I am unable to load either 3rd party apps or 3rd party complications on my watch.  To try to fix this, I've tried:\r\n\r\n - Deleting app from iPhone and watch.\r\n - Restarting iPhone and watch.\r\n - Re-pairing watch to iPhone.\r\n - Install other 3rd party watch apps / complications.\r\n\r\nNothing has fixed this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1a. Try to use a 3rd party watch complication and all I get is the icon.  It never updates, regardless of application.\r\n1b. Try to load a 3rd party watch application and the spinner comes up, then after some time, bumps me back to the main screen, regardless of application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3rd party watch complications should update and 3rd party watch apps should run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3rd party watch complications never update and 3rd party watch apps crash when run.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0 (13S344)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niOS version:  9.0 (13A344)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 with Apple watch sport.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
