    description: "Short version: Calling a chained method with trailing closure syntax as in the following example indents trailing closures properly ONLY if you use Xcode autocomplete:\r\n\r\narray.filter { (element) in \r\n    return true\r\n}.map { (element) -> OtherClass in\r\n    return OtherClass.process(element)\r\n}\r\n\r\nBUT, if you type the filter call and then MANUALLY type \".map {\", Xcode will auto-indent it with an extra level of indentation. I believe the Xcode dev team agrees that the autocomplete-provided trailing closure indentation is correct, but if not, you can read below for a philosophical explanation of why I think that it is: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I use multiple trailing closures in any configuration, for example array.filter { ... }.map { ... }, or Async.userInitiated { ... }.main { ... }, as is a common idiom in my Swift development so far, Xcode auto-indents the first trailing closure normally but then auto-indents the second trailing closure one tab ahead, which causes it to appear on a higher level than the rest of the line. Unfortunately, this detracts from the readability of synchronous closure-based code, and also presents an inconsistency with similar code in objective-C (e.g. calling [MagicalRecord saveWithBlock:^{ ... } completion:^{ ... }] would indent both blocks to the same indentation level in objC).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Swift file in Xcode\r\n2. Enter the following line: let array: [Int?] = [1, 3, 5, nil]\r\n3. Type \"array.filter\" and press enter twice to expand the trailing closure auto-complete; fill in the parentheses with \"num\", press tab and fill in the body of the closure with \"return num != nil\"\r\n4. Move down a line to the closing brace from the filter call and type \".map {\" -- WITHOUT PRESSING ENTER TO AUTOCOMPLETE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe line that I just typed on says \"}.map {\" and stays on the same level of indentation as the line containing its opening brace.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe line that I just typed on says \"}.map {\" and indents an extra level past the level of indentation of the line containing its opening brace."
