    description: "Summary:\r\nEnterprise In House apps don't start after upgrading to iOS 9 and don't give any feedback about having to trust the the Developer in your Preferences, unlike on a \"First install\" situation\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Take an iOS 8 device\r\n- install an enterprise in-house signed OTA app from a https link or something.\r\n- Install a second app by the same developer\r\n- Both Apps start and work etc\r\n- Upgrade to iOS 9\r\n- Try to open any of those apps.\r\n- The app will first start, but then be killed by the OS. There is NO user feedback that the user needs to go into his preferences to \"Trust\" the developer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to get the same dialog that you get when you install from scratch the very first application from un untrusted developer:\r\n\r\nNormally you get:\r\nUntrusted Enterprise Developer: \"iPhone Distribution: Developer name\" has not been trusted, their enterprise apps will not be available for use\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing. Total confusion for the user.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 13A340\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
