        Summary:
        iTunes refuses to sync iDevice due to lack of space. iTunes unable to count correctly.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Sync iPad mini with iOS 9.1 using iTunes 12.3.
        Have about 3.91GB free on the iPad mini.
        iTunes complains that it can't sync because 155,9MB are required and only 215,1MB are free. (Of course the free space is larger than the required amount shown. Also iTunes shows the device to have almost 4GB of free space available.)

        Expected Results:
        Calculate correctly, recognise there is not issue preventing a sync and just backup the device and sync it.

        Actual Results:
        See Screenshotâ€¦

        Regression:
        This happened on older iTunes and iOS releases intermittently. Seems to be back.
