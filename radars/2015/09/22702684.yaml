    description: "Some of our multi-step tests with new UI testing framework will hang when attempting to find elements because of this error.\r\n\r\nIt happens consistently on 2 separate test cases, but works fine on the other 20 or so that we have developed so far.  (It is a large project, 2000+ files)\r\n\r\nI have not been able to create a smaller project that causes the problem, but will keep trying to generate a test project of manageable size that reproduces the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt occurs on several different iOS 9 simulators"
