        Summary:
        App Store Updates Server.app on wrong partition instead of /Applications/Server.app

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have the system booted from one partition with Server App 5.0.3. Open App Store.app which shows Server.app 5.0.4 to be available. Update. App Store shows the Server.app 5.0.4 update to be successfully made.

        Expected Results:
        The dreaded “Server.app replacement detected” message should come. I should be able to launch the new version, login and migrate/update services to the new version.

        Actual Results:
        Server.app hasn't even been replaced on the system volume but on a completely different partition. App Store picked the completely wrong destination mangling another OS X installation present on another disc that was NOT to be manipulated at all.

        Regression:
        This did not happen with former Server.app updates yet.
