    description: Texts of some web pages are too small to be readable on small screens. And Safari doesn’t apply Dynamic Type to web pages. So zooming is much needed. By zooming I don’t mean double-tap-or-pinch-to-zoom which zooms into a selected region. I mean content zooming like ⌘+/- in desktop Safari.
