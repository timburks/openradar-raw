    description: "In iOS 9, if a widget is scrolled off of the Notification Center screen and then you scroll back to it, it will then be unresponsive. If you have any buttons or tappable views, they are not enabled.\r\n\r\nIn the debugger, the viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear methods are called when the widget scrolls off the screen, but the viewWillAppear method is not called when the widget comes back on screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install attached sample project, add widget to Notification Center\r\n2. Pull down NC, see widget, click on button and see that it works fine.\r\n3. Scroll the NC so that they widget is hidden. Note that \"viewWillDisappear\" is output on the console.\r\n4. Scroll the NC so that the widget is back. Note that there is no \"viewWillAppear\" message in the console. Note that the button in the widget no longer works.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the widget to continue to be functional after scrolling off the screen and back.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWidget is totally non-responsive and is not responsive until the Notification Center is closed and reopened.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 5"
