    description: "Summary:\r\nOK first off I have no idea if this is broken or if I just don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing anymore. But I have a bunch of provisioning profiles that are \"managed by Xcode\". Sometimes they become invalid, or I add new devices that need to be included. There used to be a button in Preferences > Accounts that would refresh them; it has been replaced by a button that does not do this. Xcode 7.1 at least understands that the invalid profiles need to be updated, but the \"Update\" button next to them does nothing when I click on it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/deviceList.action\r\n2. Remove a device\r\n3. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileList.action\r\n4. Note that any \"Managed by Xcode\" profiles are now invalid\r\n5. Open Xcode 7 or 7.1 beta 2\r\n6. Choose Xcode > Preferences\r\n7. Click on the Accounts icon\r\n8. Click \"View Details…\" in the bottom-right\r\n9. Click \"Download all\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdmittedly, it just says \"Download all\", so it's reasonable to not expect it to do anything else. But it used to be a refresh button that would refresh any profiles it was managing and replace all the existing profiles with the latest versions. I can't say if I really *expected* it to still do that, but I at least *hoped* it would.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWell, it does exactly what the button says. It downloads all the (valid) provisioning profiles. It doesn't update any invalid ones. It doesn't even delete any existing ones, it'll just dump a bunch of duplicates in there for you. While technically accurate, it is not very useful.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMost of my testing has been with Version 7.0 (7A220), on both OS X 10.10.5 and OS X 10.11 GM seed (15A282b). I also checked 7.1 beta 2 (7B75) to verify that the \"Download all\" button would not refresh the profiles there either.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI could not figure out any way to get Xcode 7 or 7.1 beta 2 to update the invalid provisioning profiles. Perhaps if I had changed the capabilities of my project or something that would have forced it to update them, but I didn't want to change the project—just get updated profiles with the latest list of devices. Eventually I had to download Xcode 6.4 just to refresh the profiles; now I can download them with Xcode 7 successfully. This is especially unfortunate since I was hoping to upgrade my main development machine to 10.11 when it's released, but since it's not compatible with Xcode 6 I won't be able to.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac 5K, 4GHz i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, M295X\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
