    description: "We noticed crashes in Firefox for iOS on iOS 8.4.1 (not 9, apparently).\r\n\r\nWe specify allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures = true for our WKWebViews.\r\n\r\nWhen the user swipes forward or back when a page is fully loaded, webView: didFinishNavigation: is called with a nil WKNavigation.\r\n\r\nOur workaround is to treat the implicitly unwrapped optional as a real optional, checking for nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Firefox on an 8.4.1 device.\r\nLoad a page and wait for it to completely load.\r\nClick a link and wait for it to completely load.\r\nSwipe left to navigate back.\r\n\r\nCurrent Firefox will crash.\r\nFirefox after Bug 1207179: prints a log message about nil navigation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash: either guarantee that the WKNavigation is never nil, or change the signature of the delegate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash: WKNavigation is nil."

    title: WKWebView navigation delegate sometimes receives a nil WKNavigation, despite being declared as implicitly unwrapped (Swift 2.0)
