    description: "Summary:\r\nMy app includes a split view which, up until OS X 10.11, would let you double click its divider/split bar in order to collapse it. This no longer works and the corresponding method is never invoked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile the attached project with Xcode 7.\r\n2. Run the project on OS X 10.10 and OS X 10.11.\r\n3. Drag the split bar to the left and right of the window.\r\n4. Double-click the split bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe split bar snaps from 50 pixels from the left side of the window to the left edge of the window; it cannot be pulled closer than 50 pixels to the right edge of the window.\r\n\r\nDouble-clicking the split bar causes it to collapse to the left edge of the window, and a corresponding message is logged.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSnapping works similarly on 10.10 and 10.11.\r\n\r\nNothing happens when I double-click on the split bar in 10.11, whereas it collapses on 10.10.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 (7A218) / OS X 10.11 (15A282b)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBroken on: OS X 10.11 (15A282b)\r\nWorks on: OS X 10.10.5 (14F27)\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SplitTest.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n(http://sabi.net/temp/22675408/SplitTest.zip)"
