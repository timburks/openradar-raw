    description: "Summary:\r\nI use a supertooth voice as a handsfree for calling in my car. When I call someone, calling works fine over bluetooth. Additionally, I have my car stereo connected over bluetooth (both as audio and as handsfree). When calling, I select in the bluetooth menu the supertooth for voice and it's fine. \r\nBut: When I hang up on the call, music resumes over the car stereo, then stops again, my supertooth tells me with its lovely robotix voice \"call ended\", but the music doesn't continue. Either the supertooth or the iPhone still think I'm in a call (although I'm not). Long pressing on the end call button mitigates this and the bluetooth permanent connection gets closed and music resumes. Alteratively, powering down and up the supertooth works, too.\r\nWhy am I reporting this as a bug? This behavior is as of iOS 8, previously, it worked like a charm.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an iPhone via Bluetooth to: \r\n1.1 A car stereo with both an audio and a handsfree calling bluetooth profile\r\n1.2 A supertooth voice handsfree\r\n2. Play some music over your stereo\r\n3. Call someone, speak over the supertooth\r\n4. End the call with the red button\r\n5. music should continue, and it does but stops shortly after\r\n6. Supertooth voice should now say \"call ended\"\r\n7. now you still see the blue light being on permanently on the supertooth and music still doesn't continue\r\n8. pressing the red end call button on the supertooth might help\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nat step 7., the bluetooth connection should be closed so the blue LED would switch back to the blinking mode -> then music resumes playing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nat step 7, the connection doesn't get closed again until the user either repeatedly hits the red end call button on the supertooth or renboots the supertooth\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.x->9.0 public beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S 32 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
