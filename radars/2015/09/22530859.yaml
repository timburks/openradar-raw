        Summary:
        The new `startosinstall` binary included with OS X 10.11 by default requires user interaction to accept the license agreement, and while an option exists to pre-accept this license agreement, it is not documented.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Obtain the Beta 7 "Install OS X" app.
        2. Run the following command:

        sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan\ Developer\ Beta.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall

        Expected Results:
        The option which allows a user to pre-accept the license agreement (and thus more easily wrap this utility with a script), "--nointeraction", is listed in the Arguments section of the usage output.

        Actual Results:

        Usage output is displayed with the supported arguments, but "--nointeraction" is missing.

        Arguments
        --volume, a path to the target volume.
        --applicationpath, a path to copy of the OS installer application to start the install with.
        --license, prints the user license agreement only.
        --usage, prints this message.

        Regression:
        None. `startosinstall` is a new utility in OS X 10.11.

        Notes:
        The --license option also does not seem to work currently. Only the usage output is displayed.
