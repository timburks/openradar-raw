    description: "Summary:\r\nAs Swift is changing fast, it would be great if we could determine in code what version of Swift is being used to compile that code. Similar to testing what platform (iOS vs OS X) that we are on.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n#if swiftVersion() == \"1.2\"\r\n// do this\r\n#else\r\n// do that\r\n#endif\r\n\r\nThis would let us update library/framework code used in lots of projects and not force all projects to upgrade to the newest Swift at the same time."
