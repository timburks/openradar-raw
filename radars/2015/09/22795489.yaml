    description: "Summary:\r\nMy weather is set to display in Celsius, which it does in the Weather app and when I ask Siri what the weather is (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nDespite this setting in Weather, the temperature is displayed in Fahrenheit when I type Weather in Spotlight search (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set region to US to default to Fahrenheit temperature.\r\n2. Open the Weather app and set the unit to Celsius.\r\n3. Press and hold the home button to invoke Siri, and ask \"What's the weather?\" Siri displays the temperature in Celsius.\r\n4. Return to the home screen.\r\n5. Scroll to the left or swipe down to bring up Spotlight Search.\r\n6. Type in Weather and wait for the temperature to be shown. (This sometimes only listed weather apps without showing the temperature. Repeat if necessary to view temperature.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpotlight Search should show the temperature in Celsius (the same units as the Weather app/Siri).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpotlight Search shows the temperature in Fahrenheit."
