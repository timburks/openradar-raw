    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen resizing a PDF in Preview, the image blurs and does not resharpen automatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a PDF in Preview\r\n2. Make the window smaller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPDF image stays sharp and clear, or at least sharpens up as soon as I stop adjusting the window size.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent becomes blurred and does not resharpen without further intervention.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A282b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you scroll up and down in the document a few times, most (but not always all) of the pages will sharpen up again.  Making the window larger and then smaller again also seems to work.\r\n\r\nI've seen this happen with various PDFs, most recently the VMWare quote (image attached), which claims to have come from \"Oracle XML Publisher 5.6.3\", and a document created with PDFLaTeX.\r\n\r\nThese same documents can be resized as expected on a machine running Yosemite.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookPro6,2 Serial Number W80453V8AGZ"
