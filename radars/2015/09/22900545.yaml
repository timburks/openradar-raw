        Summary:

        Beginning with the watchOS 2 release, the Workout no longer reports average heart rate for the “Other” workout. All that is shown is a dash.

        The heart rate samples during the exercise are collected at a rate of 2-12 per minute with values around 100 bpm (all of which are normal for me.) These values are shown correctly in the Health app.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Do some exercise with the “Other” workout.

        Expected Results:

        See an average heart rate for the workout in both the watch app and the iOS Activity app.

        Actual Results:

        Heart rate is displayed as a dash.

        Regression:

        This worked fine in watchOS 1.x

        Notes:

        I use the “Other” workout because it’s the only one that’s available for swimming.
