    description: "Summary:\r\nMy fancy new iPhone 6s has the best pocket-held camera I've ever owned. Yet as I walk the streets of my neighborhood, listening to music, enjoying a podcast, or otherwise occupying the audio output of the phone in a meaningful way, any attempt to invoke the powers of that brilliant camera cuts short my listening pleasure.\r\n\r\nMy iPhone 6 did not exhibit this problem. I don't know for certain if the problem is specific to the hardware, or to the version iOS 9.0.1 that happens to be installed on my new phone, or some combination of the two.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start listening to a dope jam in, say, Apple Music.\r\n2. Go for a walk, or pretend like you have done so.\r\n3. Switch to the Camera app.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSo long as the camera is not set to video mode, and so long as the \"Live Photo\" feature is off, the music should keep playing. Ideally, as a matter of fact, the music should keep playing even if video were being filmed, or live photos were being captured, but I'll take what I can get: a return to the status quo. Still photos should be possible without interrupting audio playback from other apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn every case, invoking the Photos app causes the playback to pause. Worse: it doesn't even resume playback after switching out of the Photos app. The original source of audio must be reopened, and playback resumed manually.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSpace gray iPhone 6s 128GB.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
