    description: "tappr.tv is an iOS app that lets users dance to their favorite songs, and record and share those dances with others.  Dances are recorded as normalized motion capture data streams of touch and tilt events, and are rendered in real time using a game engine particle emitter system (called wands).\r\n\r\ntappr.tv supports an ad-hoc network configuration, where multiple devices can act as inputs, and a central device receives and composites all the rendered motion data for display.  I've used the open source CocoaAsyncNetwork lib in the past, but switched to Multipeer Connectivity in anticipation of AppleTV.\r\n\r\nFurther, I'd like to create a \"jukebox\" party, mode, where the Apple TV version of tappr.tv can be accessed by individual devices, and users can choose and up-vote dances in a queue.\r\n\r\nI'd *love* to bring tappr.tv to AppleTV!"
