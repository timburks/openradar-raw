    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Element.getBoundingClientRect()-API supposedly gets an element's top, right, bottom and left edge offsets as relative to the viewport. For an element with fixed position, these measurements should not change during scroll.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Safari on iOS 8+, the top value changes during the scroll, as if the element reverts to something akin to position:absolute, and then revert to the fixed value some time after the scrolling stops. (This is only noticeable when debouncing the scroll handler – see additional notes)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the ”correct” value is not entirely correct either – in a test case where the element is positioned with a top offset of 0, the value reported is often -1 after the scroll stops.\r\n\r\nThis worked in iOS7, and the breakage in iOS8+ has caused interop issues in JS feature detection of fixed positioning, e.g. in libraries like https://github.com/filamentgroup/fixed-fixed and Kangax's \"Common Feature Tests\" library (http://kangax.github.io/cft/#IS_POSITION_FIXED_SUPPORTED)\r\nFixed position is broken in many older mobile platforms, so responsible developers turn to JS feature detection to enable fixed UI components. The only reliable method was to check the top value of a getBoundingClientRect-call, which is now broken on iOS causing the inadvertent disabling of fixed positioning on many websites.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit http://jsbin.com/dugaqa/25/edit?html,css,js,output\r\n2. Observe the fixed positioning of the element with ID foo, and the JS code that outputs the top value of #foo to the page on scroll.\r\n3. Scroll the page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe top value that is output to the page should always be 0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe top value varies wildly on scroll.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9.0.1, iOS8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee http://jsbin.com/dugaqa/21/edit?html,css,js,output for an example demonstrating how this value reverts to 0 or -1 when debouncing the scroll handler – but also note that even this strategy does sometime report other incorrect values, possibly related to scrolling to the top or bottom edge of the viewport.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
