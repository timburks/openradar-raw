        Summary:
        The Apple Watch simulator in Xcode 7 has an icon of an iPhone, and not an icon of an Apple Watch.  This causes confusion when using the Application Switcher to get to the proper Simulator, since the iPhone Simulator uses the same icon.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Launch the Apple Watch simulator.

        Expected Results:
        See an Apple Watch icon.

        Actual Results:
        See an iPhone icon.

        Regression:
