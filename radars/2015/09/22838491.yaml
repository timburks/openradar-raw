    description: "Summary:\nRenaming .csr files does not recognize extension, is inconsistens and sets text selection incorrectly\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nCretate two files.\nfoo.pem and foo.csr (they could be a certificate a certificate signing request) It doesn't matter if there is actually any real content in the files.\n\nSelect one of the files and hit Enter to get into file renaming in the Finder.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe .csr and .pem files should have the filename selected for renaming, but the extension (.csr or .pem) should not be selected to be \n\nActual Results:\nWith the .pem file, the extension is recognized and the selection spans the filename but leaves out the .pem extension.\n.csr is not recognized as an extension. The complete filename is selected.\n\nRegression:\nI haven't seen this behaviour in older OS X versions. I haven't tested this in El Capitan 10.11. betas.\n\nNotes:\nn/a"
