    description: "Summary:\r\ndidAppear() should be called after the interface has appeared, providing developers with a place to start animations.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it doesn't get called. It happens more frequently on the first launch of the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new watchOS 2 project\r\n2. In the initial Interface Controller, implement awakeWithContext(_:), willActivate(), and didAppear() with print statements inside them.\r\n3. Run the Watch app and see if all three are called\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll three methods should be called during the launch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nawakeWithContext(_:) and willActivate() are always called but didAppear() is skipped 20% of the time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLatest watchOS (watchOS 2.0)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.0, running on iOS 9 simulator"
