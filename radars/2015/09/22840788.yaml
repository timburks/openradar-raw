    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have one app with two bundle identifiers. One is a \"Beta\" for testing, and the other is our App Store version. Our apple-app-site association.son file is attached with this configuration.\r\n\r\nBoth apps claim the activitycontinuation: entitlement with the same domain.\r\n\r\nFor a webpage URL that is a prefix match (e.g. /account/*) but isn't supported in the app (e.g. /account/connect-to-facebook), the app calls application.openURL() during application(_:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:).\r\n\r\nIf both the beta and app store version of an app are on the same phone, this process results in an infinite loop, switching between the Beta and App Store versions over-and-over as described in the video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an apple-app-site-association file on www.example.com, with two apps: \"AAAA.com.example.Example\" and \"AAAA.com.example.Example.enterprise\". \r\n2. Install two versions of an app on the same device with the two identifiers specified in Step 1\r\n3. Call openURL() in those apps during application(_:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:)\r\n4. Navigate to one of the claimed URL paths from Safari\r\n5. Observe the infinite app switching\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be good if there was an option to call `openURL` with an `alwaysInSafari` parameter, or perhaps document a custom URL scheme for Safari that forces this. Maybe simpler, know that all calls to `openURL` from the handoff restoration methods should not continue in any other apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\napp switching continues infinitely between both versions of the app"
