    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an AppleScript creates a new Reminder and then attempts to modify the attributes of that Reminder, the Reminders app hangs for more than 10 seconds in a call to TCCAccessCheckAuditToken before finally approving the request.\r\n\r\nThe same hang does not occur when the script is run from Script Editor or from the osascript tool in Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe same hang does not occur when performing similar scripted changes in Contacts.\r\n\r\nThe same hang does not occur when a new reminder is created with initial values specified as a properties argument to the \"make\" request.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download FastScripts.app from http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/\r\n2. Download attached script and save it to ~/Library/Scripts\r\n3. Open FastScripts and click through the first-launch advice.\r\n4. Click the FastScripts icon in the upper-right corner of the menu bar, and select the script \"TestSlowness\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script should run immediately and the new Reminder should be present in the Reminders list.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA long delay of 10+ seconds ocucrs while the Reminders app is hung in TCCAccessCheckAuditToken.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A279b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOpen the same provided script in Script Editor, and edit it to call \"TestFastness()\" instead. It will execute immediately.\r\n\r\nA similar script to Contacts does not cause a hang:\r\n\r\ntell application \"Contacts\"\r\n\tset newContact to make new person\r\n\tset first name of newContact to \"Bobby Buggy\"\r\n\tsave\r\nend tell\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" 2014\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestSlowness.scpt' was successfully uploaded."
