    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I have two UITextFields, one with an inputAccessoryView and one without, or both with inputAccessoryViews but of different heights, I should receive keyboard change notifications when switching focus between the two.  In the current beta it does not, but it did in iOS8.4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached app.\r\n2. Focus one text field.\r\n3. Observe that the log is full of keyboard change notifications.\r\n4. Clear the log.\r\n5. Select the other keyboard.\r\n6. See that a new input accessory view is visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe log fills up with notifications about height changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe log does not report the keyboard size change.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS9KeyboardIssue.zip' was successfully uploaded."
