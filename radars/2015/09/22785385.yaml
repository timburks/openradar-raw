    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an Objective-C protocol is extended by a Swift protocol, the class does not properly conform to the parent protocol. This is language independent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift protocol\r\n2. Make that Swift protocol extend an Objective-C protocol\r\n3. Implement a class that conforms to the Swift protocol\r\n4. Check conformance to the Objective-C protocol\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe model (or class) conforms to the protocol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe model does not conform to the protocol.\r\nThis fails using Swiftâ€™s `is` and `as` operators, as well as `conformsToProtocol:` in Objective-C.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Objective-C protocol can be defined in either language.\r\nIf the class _explicitly_ declares that it implements the protocol, everything works as expected.\r\nPure swift protocols do not exhibit this behavior."
