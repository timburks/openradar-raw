    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Mac AppStore, for a couple of version the only channel to download software update and installation disks, recently removed the possibility to download OS X Mavericks and below. This could not appear as a serious problem for the average Mac user but give serious challenge in a lot of very legitimate scenario:\r\n\r\n- VM/physical machine running software incompatible with Yosemite and onward\r\n- Macs unable to run Mavericks and onward (Core 2 Duo)\r\n\r\nApple is a mass market company, and thus need to address needs that could appear out of the standard target.\r\nEspecially after Xcode Ghost, nobody wants to read about Apple forcing user to download install images from shady websites\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the MAS\r\n2. Log in with an account that used to purchase OS X Mavericks or below\r\n3. Open the Purchase tab to download the image\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe entry for the OS is available\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe entry is not available\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis removal is already collecting significant attention, caused by something that highly probably doesn't deserve the trouble"
