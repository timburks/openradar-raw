    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to use Siri for some location aware reminders, Siri always tell me that I need to activate location services for Reminders even though I set them moments ago.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go into \"Settings\" -> \"Privacy\" -> \"Location Services\"\r\n2. Find \"Reminders\" and set it to \"While Using the App\"\r\n3. Open Safari and navigate to some arbitrary website\r\n4. Activate Siri and say \"Remind me about this when I arrive home\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA reminder for the website is created that is triggered when I arrive home.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri tells me that I need to activate location services for Reminders. When I switch back to \"Location Services\" for Reminders, it is set to \"Never\" even though I set it to \"While Using the App\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 GM (13A340)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDon't know if this matters, but I'm using Siri with its language set to \"German\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, 64GB, WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
