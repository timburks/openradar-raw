    description: "Summary:\nFunction body containing variable declaration seems to shadow class property with the same name (when addressed without `self.` prefix)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nConsider following code.\n\nclass Class {\n    var property: String?\n    \n    func function() {\n        if property == nil { // use of local variable ‘property’ before its declaration\n            return\n        }\n        \n        let property = “String”\n        self.property = property\n    }\n}\n\nExpected Results:\n`if property == nil` should refer to the property not to the constant declared further in the function body\n\nActual Results:\nSeems like `let property` declared towards the end of the function shadows the property even before declaration.\n\nRegression:\nreferring to the property using `self.property` works as expected"
