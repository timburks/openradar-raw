Go to System Preferences>General>Appearance\r\n2. Set Appearance to Graphite\r\n3. Click any checkbox (for example, any one in the same window), and observe the brief change in color from Graphite to Blue while it animates\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpon clicking the checkbox, it should remain in the Graphite color while it animates.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUpon clicking the checkbox, it briefly appears blue, not graphite, as it animates, and then returns to graphite after the animation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A282a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'graphite bug.mov' was successfully uploaded."
