    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22517365\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe new `startosinstall` binary included with OS X 10.11 by default requires user interaction to accept the license agreement, and while an option exists to pre-accept this license agreement, it is not documented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Obtain the Beta 7 \"Install OS X\" app.\r\n2. Run the following command:\r\n\r\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan\\ Developer\\ Beta.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe option which allows a user to pre-accept the license agreement (and thus more easily wrap this utility with a script), \"--nointeraction\", is listed in the Arguments section of the usage output.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUsage output is displayed with the supported arguments, but \"--nointeraction\" is missing.\r\n\r\nArguments\r\n--volume, a path to the target volume.\r\n--applicationpath, a path to copy of the OS installer application to start the install with.\r\n--license, prints the user license agreement only.\r\n--usage, prints this message.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. `startosinstall` is a new utility in OS X 10.11.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe --license option also does not seem to work currently. Only the usage output is displayed."
