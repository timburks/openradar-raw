    description: "According to https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1892/_index.html the Apple Watch Companion app displays apps using the CFBundleName, not the  CFBundleDisplayName.\r\n\r\nThis is bad for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n- It's inconsistent since everywhere else (home screen app name, WK app name) CFBundleDisplayName is used\r\n- When localizing CFBundleName, this is also reflected in the standard HTTP user agent of NSURLRequest. In most cases it's not desirable to send a localized user agent to the server. Server apps sometimes need to parse the user agent e.g. to retrieve the app version number. Parsing a localized app name is more complicated and error prone. It also distorts user agent statistics because requests from the same app appear under different user agent names."
