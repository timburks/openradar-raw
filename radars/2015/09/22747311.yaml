    description: "Summary:\r\nI've integrated the new Notes app into many parts of my workflow. I've found the drawing features very useful, and the incredibly fast sync has had me switching from my current triumvirate of note-taking apps.\r\n\r\nAs a programmer, my notes workflow includes a lot of little snippets of things related to my work: Terminal commands, debugger tricks, steps, checklists, etc. These aren't appropriate for storing in the filesystem (playgrounds, repositories), and would ideally have near-instant search for them. The Notes app would be great for this, but code is really difficult to store in sans-serif proportional fonts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy code text from Xcode or a code editor\r\n2. Open Notes\r\n3. Create a new note\r\n4. Paste code text into the note\r\n5. Code is transformed into proportional text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can use the \"Choose a style to apply to text\" to apply a monospace font to select text, or paste in monospaced text like I would into TextEdit, Pages, or Evernote.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly Title, Heading, and Body exist to modify the font in note text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11 (15A282b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
