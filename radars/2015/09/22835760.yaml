    description: "Summary:\r\nInterface Builder provides a font chooser for stock controls, but when designing a custom UIView with IBInspectable attributes, UIFont properties marked IBInspectable are ignored.\r\n\r\nThis leaves developers unable to make a font customizable for their controls in Interface Builder (it is possible to provide two properties instead: font name and font size, but these are error-prone and not user-friendly)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIView subclass as follows:\r\n\r\n@IBDesignable\r\nclass CounterView: UIView {\r\n@IBInspectable var font: UIFont?\r\n}\r\n\r\nInclude it in a storyboard and select it to customise it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Attributes Inspector should include a font selection control.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo font selection control is displayed in the Attributes Inspector.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7"
