    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Swift, if a SKPhysicsBody is generated with init(texture texture: SKTexture, size size: CGSize), and the input texture's non transparent sections does not span the width or height of the texture, the resultant collision/physics boundary is stretched.  An example of this might be where if you had a png which had a shape in the middle surrounded by transparency. If you used that png as a texture to initialize a SKPhysicsBody, the boundaries on the resultant physics body would be stretched to span the entire width and height of the original png image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nlet texture = textureAtlas.textureNamed(\"sprite_png_image_name\")\r\nvar character = SKSpriteNode(texture: texture)\r\nlet texture = _textureAtlas.textureNamed(\"collision_png_image_name\")\r\ncharacter.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: texture, size: character.size)\r\n...\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe collision boundary for the \"character\" SKSpriteNode should match the silhouette of the non-transparent sections of \"texture\" and not be stretched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe collision boundary for the \"character\" SKSpriteNode is stretched in the X and Y dimensions by the amount the \"texture\" png's non-transparent parts of the image do not span the entire width and height of the png's frame.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRunning via Xcode Version 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o). This was not a problem in iOS 8 but is a problem in iOS 9 beta.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
