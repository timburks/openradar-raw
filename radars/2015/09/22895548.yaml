    description: "Summary:\r\nWanted to experiment the new taptic engine with the new iPhone 6S at some store before buying it.\r\n\r\nI opened the Settings > Song > Create Vibration Panel  and started playing with it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly at some point, the phone started vibrating by itself on random interval and acting crazy on vibration. Without even touching the phone.\r\n\r\nYes, touching the \"stop\", \"cancel\" button on that controller also didn't have any effect. It seems that going out of the settings application stopped the vibrations though.\r\n\r\nps: once i got back at the office and told a coworker to play with it, and without touching the phone or influencing my coworker it stumbled upon the same issue, vibration going crazy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open settings\r\n2. Navigate to sounds > ringtone\r\n3. Open vibrations settings for ringtone\r\n4. Create new ringtone.\r\n\r\n5. start playing with the touch panel, try using 3D touch (even though it doesn't seems to do anything) \r\n6. Tap a few time, it seems that at some point the controller is lagging and then vibrations start to behave by themself\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe vibrations should only happen when the user press the screen, 3D Touch could be use to control the intensity of the vibrations.\r\n\r\nGoing crazy on the controller shouldn't release any vibration warfare.\r\n\r\nThe vibration should follow the defined pattern, not act on their own.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhone goes crazy on vibration. \r\n\r\nThere no pattern to the vibration, especially not the one defined by the user. The record / play / stop button doesn't have any effect.\r\n\r\nLeaving the app seems to stop the vibrations.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6S, with 3D Touch and stuff\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
