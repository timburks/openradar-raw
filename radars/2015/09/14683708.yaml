    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen downloading a large application from the Mac App Store, the download is interrupted by user-idle sleep. This is extremely annoying and contrary to user expectation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Check that idle sleep is configured on the Mac in question.\r\n* Initiate download of a large application, such as Xcode or an OS X installer, while connected to the internet via a connection that will not allow the download to complete within the idle sleep time.\r\n* Stop using the computer and wait for the download to progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* Mac should eventually dim its screen but not go into system standby until the download has completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* Mac eventually goes into system sleep.\r\n* If you wake the Mac, you will notice that the download has failed with an error.\r\n\r\nIf you check power assertions during a running app download:\r\n\r\n# pmset -g assertions\r\n[…]\r\nAssertion status system-wide:\r\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\r\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\r\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0\r\n   ExternalMedia                  0\r\n   UserIsActive                   0\r\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\r\n   BackgroundTask                 0\r\n[…]\r\n\r\nThere should be a PreventUserIdleSystemSleep assertion!\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI don't think the Mac App Store application has worked properly since it launched; I have only specifically tested power assertions on OS X 10.8.4, however. It should be noted that Safari and other browsers correctly create a power assertion while downloading files.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAssertions during a Safari download:\r\n\r\n# pmset -g assertions\r\n08/08/2013 12:18:40 CEST \r\nAssertion status system-wide:\r\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\r\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\r\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1\r\n   ExternalMedia                  0\r\n   UserIsActive                   0\r\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\r\n   BackgroundTask                 0\r\n[…]"
