    description: "Summary:\r\nFrameworks shipped with an app bundle take too long to load on first launch. This makes them unusable for apps with more than a handful of dependencies â€“ a huge issue since you can only ship Swift dependencies using frameworks, not static libraries.\r\n\r\nI created a repo with a sample app and a comprehensive description of the whole problem: https://github.com/stepanhruda/dyld-image-loading-performance\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee sample repo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFrameworks don't add several seconds to a bundle's launch time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFrameworks add several seconds to a bundle's launch time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHappens in iOS 8, it's even worse in iOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf the executable includes the same symbols linked statically, it there's no performance hit."
