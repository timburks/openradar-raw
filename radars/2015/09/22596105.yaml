        Summary:
        Itâ€™s currently impossible to autocomplete code imported from the attached framework. Attempting to do so results in an immediate SourceKit crash.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create a Mac project.
        - Link to attached frameworks (ReactiveCocoa.framework and Result.framework).
        - Create a file and `import ReactiveCocoa`.
        - Write a function with this code: `SignalProducer(value: 1)`
        - Type a dot (.) after the previous declaration.

        Expected Results:
        - Xcode autocompletes the available methods.

        Actual Results:
        - SourceKit crashes (you can see an example crash in the attached ZIP file).

        Regression:
        This is a regression from Beta 5.

        Notes:
        The built framework corresponds to this commit of ReactiveCocoa: https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/commit/5e75726bf232b76b17169b3d9c9c64d1fd6bffbe
