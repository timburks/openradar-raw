    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is an API notification that a user has taken a screen shot. It is HIGHLY needed to have a manner with which to be warned in advance to make adjustments. From a business point of view there may be sensitive or copyrighted material on the screen that must NOT be copied in any form.\r\n\r\nBy not having this API intercept point the developer can inevitably be liable for information that they are required to display but not permit to be copied.\r\n\r\nExamples of Apple doing this are:\r\nin screen shots of certain video assets when playing thru iTunes.\r\nthe MFI documentation where the document is watermarked, locked, and screen shots are unavailable.\r\n\r\nAs a developer my option is to not display the information (defeating the purpose of the app) or run the risk that a user will screen shot and release information otherwise protected. Since there is limited information about a user available (Apple's admittedly great privacy practices) it does not afford easy watermarking on the fly of information.\r\n\r\nWith this API/Notification, the developer can black out / water mark screen composition that a user is attempting to capture.\r\n\r\nThis theoretically could be added with an enhancement to a UI View that allows the user to set a 'no screen shot' delegate or image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nscreen shot in an app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPreferred (not expected)\r\nscreen shot an app with a protected image\r\nimage can be blacked out for screen shot\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nimage capture with full screen intact.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a VERY HIGH / ESSENTIAL need.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny"
