    description: "Summary: Since the new style of documentation was launched (after Swift was first announced), trying to view on an iPhone has been awful. \r\nScrolling doesn't work properly, if you try and scroll quickly it jumps about, you have to scroll slowly and keep your finger on the screen as much as possible. \r\nThe formatting is also terrible, for over a year now a white box has floated in the corner which doesn't do anything. \r\nTrying to use a menu is equally terrible, once you tap on an item the menu doesn't disappear, there's no way to dismiss it and you have to refresh the page manually.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Load a page of the iOS documentation on iPhone which uses the new style of formatting\r\n2. Try to scroll quickly\r\n3. Tap on the menu which is meant to display links to jump to a section\r\n4. Tap on a section to jump to, you won't be able to dismiss the menu and see the section you selected without refreshing the page\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Scrolling should be normal like any other web page. You should be able to navigate sections in the page without refreshing. There shouldn't be a white box floating on the page obscuring content. \r\n\r\nActual Results: Scrolling \"jumps\" about, the only way to scroll is very slowly and by keeping a finger on the screen. Navigating using the menu is impossible without reloading the page. The white box covers content."
