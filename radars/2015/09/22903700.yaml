    description: "Summary:\nMessages/Jabber service doesn't use TLS even if certificate is installed and configured\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nInstall private RSA key and matching CA signed certificate.pem in Server.app 5.0.4 as well as have the necessary intermediate certificate of your signing CA installed on the System.keychain.\n\n\nExpected Results:\nAfter assigning a certificate to Messages service I expect the Messages service to not only support but even require TLS for any C2S connection.\n\nActual Results:\nMessages services still does not support TLS at all, only plaintext connections. \nCertificate Selection shows “custom configuration” which usually indicates that Server.app fucked something up with certificates again.\n\nRegression:\nThis actually did work in 5.0.3.\nCompletely Removing the certificate and RSA private keys and reimporting them again does not remedy the problem.\n\nIt is NOT possible to manually fix Server.app's broken key/certificate management by fixing the hostname.example.com.<UUID>.concat.pem file by concatenating the private key at the end. This should have been done by Server.app but seems mostly broken since Server 5.\n\nThis means, Messages service can't be used due to lack of any encryption.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\nNo warning is given to the admin that users will leak their single-sign-on passwords over plaintext logins by using the Messages service.\nserverdiagnose archive attached."
