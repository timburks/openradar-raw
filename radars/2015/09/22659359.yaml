    description: "Summary:\nWhen I initiate an update of the OS from my phone using the Watch app, the update should be allowed to run when the watch goes into Nightstand mode (and has more than 50% of battery), irregardless of the passcode lock.\n\nSince the update is blocked by passcode, it means that all the \"free\" time you have for updating the Watch while it's on my nightstand while I sleep is unused. I woke up, put the Watch on, enter the passcode and then get greeted to the update progress circle. That's pretty stupid.\n\nI've had this happen three times now. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n0. don't have your watch connected to power\n1. Initiate the update in the phone Watch app\n2. wait the download of the new version to the Watch is complete (phone app gives a notification that it cannot continue without power)\n3. connect Watch to power\n4. put Watch in nightstand mode\n\nExpected Results:\nOnce battery >50% the update process continues.\n\nActual Results:\nThe update process is blocked until I enter my passcode on the Watch. I initiated the process on my phone, it should not depend on an unlocked Watch to continue."
