    description: "Summary:\r\nThis works differently for Contact.app's items.\r\n\r\nWhen the user taps on the phone button, if the item has multiple, an action sheet will appear allowing the user to select between home/work/mobile/other/etc.\r\n\r\nThis should be replicated for 3rd party spotlight items, otherwise, people won't be able to select which phone to dial.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find a 3rd party spotlight item with multiple phone numbers loaded in CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.phoneNumbers.\r\n2. Tap the phone button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. An action sheet appears with each phone number and it's type\r\n4. User select the appropriate phone number\r\n5. The number is dialled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. The first number supplied in CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.phoneNumbers is directly dialled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe API will probably have to be modified into accepting\r\nvar phoneTypes: Array[String]?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
