    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPhone 6+ is locked in mini-setup. Going through the steps leads to a dead end, going backwards results in the phone rebooting, or at least looking like what happens when springboard \"reboots\", but faster than a full reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upgrade iOS 9 OTA\r\n2. Phone Upgrades\r\n3. Unlock on \"Hello, swipe to unlock screen\"\r\n4. Press \"Continue\" on \"Update Completed\" screen.\r\n5. Get \"Installing configuration from (null)\" screen with a grayed out \"Next\" button and a blue \"<Back\" button. \r\n\r\nAt this point the phone never moves on, never finishes \"installing config\". I have waited an hour+ with no changes. Pressing the \"<Back\" button causes an iCloud sign in screen to appear for a short second, then the phone reboots. This process repeats forever.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nComplete Mini-setup, be able to use my phone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhone unusable. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6+ upgraded to iOS 9 from the latest version of iOS 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis iPhone was once \"Supervised\" with Apple Configurator and set to auto-enroll in MDM using a URL. It was already enrolled in MDM at the time that the iOS 9 OTA update was initiated."
