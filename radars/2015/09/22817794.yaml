        Summary:
        iOS 9 suggests downloading Updates over Cellular on device lacking such an interface

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have iPad set to automatically update apps.
        Do not connect it to a power supply.
        Wait until there are updates available. (May take a few days.)

        Expected Results:
        The updates should be done, even when iPad is not connected to a power source but set to automatically update and battery level is > 30%.

        Actual Results:
        iPad does not update any apps but prompts the user and asks if updates should be made over cellular connection. This happens when the device is actually connected to a WiFi network and even if said device does not even have a cellular interface it could use.

        Regression:
        Seen in iOS 9.0 public release, still present in iOS 9.1 beta.

        Notes:
        Not only is the message confusing for the users but also complete nonsense. Screenshot attached.
