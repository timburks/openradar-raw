        Summary:

        All apps running on iOS 9 seem to include a slow trickle of background network traffic (to IP addresses owned by Apple, Akamai and SoftLayer) that cause the wi-fi radio in the device to remain active continuously.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. New project with Xcode 7
        2. “Energy Diagnostics” instrument on a device w/iOS 9
        3. Never ending trickle of network traffic
        4. Still going even when app is in the background and screen is dark

        Expected Results:

        No background network traffic. The wi-fi radio turns off.

        Actual Results:

        A few packets every few seconds. The wi-fi radio turns on.

        Notes:

        Tested on iPhone 4S with iOS 9.0.
