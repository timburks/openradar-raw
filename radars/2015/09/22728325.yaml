    description: "Summary:\r\nAVPlayerViewController on tvOS flashes its controls whenever a discontinuity is encountered, which disrupts our seamless playback experience. Controls should not be flashed when encountering a #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY in the stream.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Play an HLS stream with discontinuity markers using AVPlayerViewController and AVFoundation on tvOS\r\n2) Every time a #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY is hit AVPlayerViewController flashes its controls for a couple seconds.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA user should not be interrupted by playback controls being presented upon encountering a #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY in the HLS stream.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nControls are flashed for 1-2 seconds every time a #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY is encountered."
