    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple Watch does the best it can to estimate your calories during a workout, but when using electronic gym equipment, you often have a much more accurate measurement available (and it's usually higher). It would be great if you could edit the number of calories burned during a workout after its conclusion, ideally from the Workout app's summary screen, or at least from the Activity or Health apps on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nIf editing a workout is an option, it would also be nice to edit the time taken as well, as sometimes (reported in rdar://22591647) I forget to end the workout at its proper conclusion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Workout on electronic gym equipment, which takes your age and weight as an input before you start\r\n2. Workout\r\n3. Conclude workout on machine. Machine indicates 160 calories burned\r\n4. End workout in Workout watch app. Watch indicates 110 calories burned\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn addition to Save and Discard, there is an Edit button that allows you to use the Digital Crown to adjust the calories burned and duration\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the Save and Discard buttons are present, with no option to edit the workout from the Workout app, or the Health and Activity iPhone apps.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 1.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
