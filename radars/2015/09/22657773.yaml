        Summary:
        When the autocapitalizationType of a UISearchBar is configured in a storyboard to be UITextAutocapitalizationTypeNone it is ignored and the UISearchBar will be created with type UITextAutocapitalizationTypeSentences. All other values work as expected.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.

        Expected Results:
        The autocapitalizationType of the UISearchBar should match that in the storyboard/Interface Builder.

        Actual Results:
        See summary above.

        Regression:
        This is a regression from 7.1.1 (11D201). Problem occurs in 8.2 (12D5480a), 8.3 (12F701) and 8.4.1 (12H321)
