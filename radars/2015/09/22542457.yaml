        Summary:
        Photos takes a very long time to delete photos. After a deletion action is initiated, several seconds can sometimes pass before the UI is updated. This causes issues where the UI is jarringly updated when it is not expected to be updated. Changing selection status (when the UI is actually updated) can cause confusion and unintended deletion (if attempting to delete multiple photos in quick succession).

        Rather than photos actually being deleted on the main thread (as seems to be the case), perhaps it would be better to immediately update the UI and execute the deletion in the background. If a failure occurs (hopefully the non-normal case), a message could be shown to the user and the UI could be reverted.

        This issue happens in Photos Version 1.1 (330.21.0)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        + Open Photos
        + Delete a photo

        Expected Results:
        Photo is immediately removed from the UI, and scheduled for deletion in the background

        Actual Results:
        Photos UI takes a very long time (several seconds sometimes) to remove the photo from the interface
