    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a storyboard has a button with a popover segue to another view, even though the button is the anchor for the segue, the popover view appears anchored to the containing view instead of the button. See the attached sample project for a demonstration. This StackOverflow question identifies the same issue: http://stackoverflow.com/q/32264008/79202\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new OS X Cocoa Application with a Storyboard.\r\n* In the Main.storyboard, Add a Push Button to the view.\r\n* Add a View Controller\r\n* Control-drag the button to the new view controller.\r\n* In the Action Segue popup, select \"Popover\"\r\n* Save and run the app\r\n* In the running app, click the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView should appear in a popover anchored to the button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPopover view appears anchored to the button's parent view, or perhaps the window.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 (7A218)/OS X 10.11 Beta (15A278b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe popover segue anchor worked properly in Xcode 6.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StoryboardPopover.zip' was successfully uploaded."
