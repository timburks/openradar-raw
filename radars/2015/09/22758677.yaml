    description: "Summary:\r\nMail.app is not able to connect to Email server via any protocol (IMAP, POP, SMTP, Submission) that requires TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to configure an email account for any email server that requires TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail.app should be able to connect just fine, after all TLS 1.1 is from 2006 and TLS 1.2 is from 2008 and we're in 2015.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail.app is unable to connect since it only can use TLS 1.0 which is absolutely unacceptable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEl Captitan 10.11.0 GM Candidate 1, Yosemite 10.10.5, Mavericks 10.9.5, Mountain Lion 10.8.5, Lion 10.7.5, Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\r\niOS 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is almost comically absurd that Apple will release 10.11 with the inability to use TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 yet Tim Cook boast about how Apple is dedicated to their users security and privacy which is not observable from a user's and customer's point of view. There is no technical reality behind Tim Cook's security and privacy claims.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nANY Mail.app version in:\r\nEl Captitan 10.11.0 GM Candidate 1, Yosemite 10.10.5, Mavericks 10.9.5, Mountain Lion 10.8.5, Lion 10.7.5, Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\r\niOS 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
