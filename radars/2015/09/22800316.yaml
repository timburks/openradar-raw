        Summary:
        Wikis cannot be accessed anymore due to Proxy error.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have Wiki Server configured in 5.0.3. Upgrade to Server 5.0.4 (in hope to fix any of the other serious problems).
        Try to access Wiki.
        List of Wikis is shown, but actually entering and using a Wiki is not due to a new Proxy Error.

        Expected Results:
        Existing Wikis should be available and working.

        Actual Results:
        Wiki server can't be used anymore.

        Regression:
        This did not happen from 4.1.5 to 5.0.3. At least I could read the Wikis (even though activating group calendars for a Wiki was not possible.)

        Notes:
        Denial of service for the Wiki data. I don't know if the Wiki content is still there or has been removed as well.
