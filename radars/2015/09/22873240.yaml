    description: "Summary:\r\nNavigating from a page on reddit's mobile site to an image and then back to reddit causes the text on the reddit page to increase in size compared to the first viewing of the page, for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/.compact in Safari on iOS 9 (see \"normal\" screenshot)\r\n2. Tap the title of one of the meme entries\r\n3. If you are taken to a webpage instead of directly to an image file, start over and choose a different entry.\r\n4. Tap the Back button or swipe back to navigate back to the subreddit homepage\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page should look basically the same as it did in Step 1.\r\nIn particular, the text should be the same size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe size of all of the page's text has been increased for no apparent reason.\r\nSee \"increased\" screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149587\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S.
