        Summary:
        Thereâ€™s a serious performance regression in iOS 9 compared to iOS 8.4 with UITableView and variable row heights, when scrolling to a row with scrollToRowAtIndexPath:atScrollPosition:animated

        Steps to Reproduce: (with an iPhone 6)
        * Run the attached demo app
        * let it insert about 300 rows
        * monitor cpu usage

        Expected Results:
        similar performance and cpu usage on iOS 8.4 and iOS 9.0

        Actual Results:
        iOS 9 performance is way worse and cpu usage a lot higher

        Regression:
        This is a regression to iOS 8.4

        Notes:
        From what I see when profiling with Instruments is that with iOS 9.0.1 -[UITableView scrollToRowAtIndexPath:atScrollPosition:animated:] for some reason recalculates the height for all rows instead of using estimatedRowHeight for cells which are not visible.
