    description: "Closed as a duplicate of 12503102.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSecPKCS12Import will always fail if provided a PKCS12 file where no password has been set. The error returned is errSecPkcs12VerifyFailure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall SecPKCS12Import providing a PKCS12 file without a password.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo return a successful status and populate the provided output parameter.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe function returns errSecPkcs12VerifyFailure.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only workaround is to re-save the PKCS12 file with a password. Attempting to open the file in Keychain Access also gives this error, even after prompting for the password and providing an empty one."
