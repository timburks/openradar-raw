    description: "Summary\r\nIâ€™ve found the photo syncing between watch and phone to be largely unreliable. Initial sync when pairing the watch and phone was fine then when I change the config (upped the photo limit from 25 to 500 I just get stuck in the syncing state. Tried to change the limit back, change albums, restarted phone and watch, and nothing seems to prompt the sync to clean up and start again.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nRunning watchOS 2.0 GM and iOS 9.0 GM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair a new watch and phone\r\n2. Choose to sync 25 photos to the watch\r\n3. When successfully synced, change the photo limit to 500\r\n4. Launch the Photos app on Watch to see it stuck syncing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor the photos stored on the watch to be purged and new photos synced across. I'd also expect killing the app or changing the photo limit/album on the Watch app on the phone to kill whatever sync was in progress and start again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWatch stuck in permanent sync mode with seemingly no manual way to restart the process."
