    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22558802\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe bless command can no longer allow you to boot into an installer environment (Such as the OS X installer). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the following command:\r\nbless --setBoot --folder /path/to/installerfiles --bootefi /path/to/boot.efi  --label some_label\r\n2. Reboot and you are now in the OS X installer environment\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou reboot and are now in the installer environment that you blessed above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe machine reboots back into the main OS X install instead of the specified\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis occurs every time\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is an extremely important tool for doing OS system upgrades without using dirty hacks. If bless cannot be fixed, we need a method for booting into the install environment in a non-interactive way."
