    description: "Summary:\r\nScript triggers currently have a very limited PATH variable, only pointing to system paths (/Applications/Xcode-7.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin). However, developers install tools like CocoaPods, Carthage, Fastlane, Ruby Gems for new Ruby versions, Homebrew etc into e.g. /usr/local/bin instead. These tools are not easily accessible from trigger scripts, because the PATH doesn't include this location.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the _xcsbuildd user, before starting a script, loaded the environment from ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.profile or any other file) and merged it with the required environment for _xcsbuildd, so that developers can easily add more search paths (like /usr/local/bin). This would be useful also for providing custom environment variables, without the need to specify them again and again in every new trigger script.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a new Ruby version with homebrew (will install in /usr/local)\r\n2. Install cocoapods (sudo gem install cocoapods - will install in /usr/local/bin)\r\n3. In your Bot's script, add \"cd PROJECT_NAME; pod install;\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould work just fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWill fail because it won't find the `pod` binary in any of the system search paths. Instead, it only lives in /usr/local/bin, which is not in PATH.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 Beta 6, OS X Server 5.0 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWould be useful for many use cases."
