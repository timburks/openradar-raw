    description: "Summary:\r\nI use zsh, but need to use bash scripts. Some of them need to use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and/or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. However, they are not passed through to bash. This emits nothing:\r\n\r\n    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=test bash -c 'echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH'\r\n\r\n I have no custom `~/.bash*` files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a terminal session with an account that uses zsh for its shell.\r\n2. Make sure there are no `~/.bash` files\r\n3. Run `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=test bash -c 'echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH'`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould emit \"test\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmits a blank line.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A278b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInterestingly, the same happens when calling zsh:\r\n\r\n    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=test zsh -c 'echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' \r\n\r\nIt looks like something in the system is mucking with this variable so it doesn't get passed through. Related to call to `setuid()` or `setgid()` as described in rdar://11894054?"
