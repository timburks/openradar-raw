        Summary:
        Favorites are centered, this looks ugly and is just bad UX.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Add a small number of favorites (anything < 6), watch in horror as Safari centers them.

        Expected Results:
        I expect them to be left aligned. This makes their click targets always be in the same area, no matter what size the browser window has. Bonus: it even looks better.

        Actual Results:
        They're centered.

        Regression:
