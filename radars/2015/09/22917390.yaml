        Summary:
        Creating a tab while 'in the middle' of a source kit crash causes the standard editor to break from its typical position.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. open the attached playground
        2. uncomment the three lines indicated
        `//    init(unicodeScalarLiteral value: Self.UnicodeScalarLiteralType) {
        //        self.init(stringLiteral: String(value))
        //    }`
        3. (not always necessary) add/remove newline characters until the bar at the top of the text view indicating a source kit crash appears.
        4. once the aforementioned bar appears, press Command-T to create a new tab.

        Expected Results:
        a new tab should visibly open

        Actual Results:
        The tab does not *seem* to have been created. Instead, the text view moves. Closing the playground and reopening shows that the tab was created, however.
