    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever a sprite's parent is changed inside a block, the sprite will no longer pass touches.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Inside a block, remove a sprite from its parent and add it to another parent.\r\n2. Attempt touching the sprite's area.\r\n3. The touch events will not be received.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the example project (attached), more spaceship sprites would be added on top of an existing spaceship after touching. Since the sprite no longer passes touches, that does not happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTouch events are not received when the sprite is touched.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A344)"
