Uploading 67 items.\r\nOn icloud.com/#photos i'm simply getting \"Cannot Load Library\"\r\n \r\nThis unfolds into -\r\n98% of photo library is inaccecible.\r\nNew photos are not syncing.\r\nDevices are out of sync.\r\n \r\nI'm genuinely worried that it might be gone for good.\r\n \r\nI can think of 3 things that I'm aware of that might be remotly related:\r\nI've upgraded my iPhone 6 to iOS 9.1 beta 2.\r\nI've enabled 2 factor authentiation on my iTunes account.\r\nLive Photos feature launch.\r\n \r\nThis has been like this for 2 days now, system status is all green https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\r\n \r\nIs there anything else I can do to help get this fixed?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a Photo\r\n2. See it's not being uploaded.\r\n\r\n1. Open Photos in iCloud. \r\n2. See no access is possible.\r\n\r\n1. Open Photos.app on your mac\r\n2. See it's out of sync.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll photos synced to the same state across all devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOut of sync, most of the photos library is gone from the iPhone. Mac shows only previously synced photos. iCloud #photo shows \"Cannot Load Library\" \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n<<my-iCloud-id>>\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.1 (15B17c)\r\niOS 9.1 (13B5119e)\r\niCloud.com / beta.iCloud.com\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-09-27 at 13.10.22.png', 'Screen Shot 2015-09-27 at 13.59.46.png' and 'Photo 27-09-2015, 14 08 19.png' were successfully uploaded."
