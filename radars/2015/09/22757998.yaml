    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Xcode documentation download system is broken.\r\n\r\nSometimes, if the stars align just right, it works. But just as often it doesn't.\r\n\r\nSometimes it just hangs, not progressing in any way and forcing at least one reboot before it might start working again. (Which includes force-quitting Xcode which refuses to pause/abort documentation downloads).\r\n\r\nAt other times it spews out some cryptic error messages.\r\n\r\nThe status indicators are not particularly accurate or useful even when they work, which mostly they don't. Often they don't seem to refresh and while pressing 'Check and Install Now' (while downloads are in progress) seems to produce some reaction, mostly it just seems to shuffle the status indicators.\r\n\r\nIf the most useful indicator of progress is watching installd CPU usage you're not in a good place.\r\n\r\nAlso, without release notes it can sometimes be hard to tell if there are actually new docsets or if Xcode is just trolling me.\r\n\r\nThis has been the case as long as I can remember since Xcode included optional documentation downloads so it isn't particularly version specific. Although the particular brokenness seems to wary from time to time but that's probably just the moon phases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo please fix this at some point.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode to download docsets\r\n2. goto 1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt just works.\r\n\r\nI'll even settle for Mac App Store installing-level and talk about a low bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA lovecraftian story involving you, a quaint village in Docsetshire and Xcodethulhu.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 7 & 7.1b1\r\nOS X: El Capitan GM\r\nMoon Pase: Waxing Crescent\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy apologies if you have to read this and my sympathies if you are dealing with the same issues. ;-)"
