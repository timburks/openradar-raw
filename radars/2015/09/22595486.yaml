    description: "Summary:\nI have several Swift projects that have suffered from test cases not being discovered by Xcode. They will often appear as runtime-discovered tests and will appear and disappear in the test navigator seemingly at random. I think part of the problem is that I have a framework that provides custom subclasses of XCTestCase for common test types, and that seems to be confusing Xcode. Iâ€™ve replaced those subclasses with a protocol and made the real test cases inherit directly from XCTestCase, and that has made them appear in the sidebar much more reliably.\n\nI have not been able to reproduce this in a sample project; it may require that the custom test case classes be in a framework, or it may be particular to the way I have created them. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nExpected Results:\n\nActual Results:\n\nRegression:\n\nNotes:"
