    description: "Summary:\r\nA timer created on an iPhone will expire and notify the user on both the phone and the paired Watch. However, a timer created on the Watch expires and notifies only from the Watch.\r\n\r\nThis is inconsistent with the \"shared\" nature of many productivity features of the Watch and iPhone. For example, if I create a reminder from the Watch, then notification upon expiration appear on both the iPhone and the Watch (and a Mac, for that matter).\r\n\r\nIt's also inconsistent and confusing that alarms or timers created phone DO notify on the Watch.\r\n\r\nBecause I want the knowledge that I will be notified from any and all devices, I am in the habit of setting these alarms and timers from my phone even though I would prefer the convenience of using Siri from my Watch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Arrange to have a paired iPhone and Watch.\r\n2. From the Watch, invoke Siri and ask \"set a timer for 1 minute\"\r\n3. Wait for the timer to expire.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe timer should notify from the phone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe timer only notifies from the watch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0 (13S5325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 with 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\nApple Watch Sport \r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
