    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice if it were possible to add protocol conformances in constrained protocol extensions, that is to add protocol conformances only to a subset of a generic type or type with an associated type.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, look at the section 'Adding Constraints to Protocol Extensions' in the 'Protocols' chapter of 'The Swift Programming Language'.\r\n\r\nTherein, 'CollectionType' is extended to provide the 'textualDescription' property in case the CollectionType's elements conform to the 'TextRepresentable' protocol.\r\n\r\n'textualDescription' itself is part of the 'TextRepresentable' protocol and the element's conformance is used to build the collection's description. However, 'CollectionType' itself cannot currently be conformed to 'TextRepresentable' using the constrained extension as presented in that section of the guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother example of where this might be useful would be to extend 'CollectionType' with 'Equatable' conformance in case the collection's elements conform to equatable themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe syntax for this could look like this for example:\r\n\r\nextension CollectionType : Equatable where Generator.Element : Equatable { }\r\n\r\nSwift can already detect the users intention and currently emits an error message to inform that this is not (yet) possible:\r\n\r\n'Extension of protocol 'CollectionType' cannot have an inheritance clause.'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A282b)\r\nVersion 7.1 beta (7B60)\r\nApple Swift version 2.0 (swiftlang_PONDEROSA-700.1.100.2 clang-700.1.74)"
