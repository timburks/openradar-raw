    description: "Summary:\r\nSince the WWDC app changed to \"Apple Events\" with the new logo the WWDC sessions are no longer available, only keynotes are available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the \"Apple Events\" app\r\n2. Select the WWDC 2015 video\r\n3. There is no option or way to select sessions videos, only the keynote is available\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPreviously we were able to select all the sessions from WWDC15 and WWDC14 and even favourite them and watch them online, a really cool usage for the AppleTV\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the initial keynote can be watched.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nI have a standard unmodified AppleTV 3 running 7.2 (7512)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWatching WWDC sessopms on the AppleTV was AWESOME! Please bring them back :(\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt always occurs, in case it matters, the AppleTV is wired to a Sony Bavia TV and connects to the internet through my Airport Express (jacked into a DSL connection)"
