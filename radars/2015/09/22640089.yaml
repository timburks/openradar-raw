    description: 'Currently, one has to use backwards idioms like #if TARGET_OS_MAC && !TARGET_OS_IPHONE in order to detect OS X. Just as a TARGET_OS_IOS was added to identify iOS specifically, separate from its sibling watchOS and tvOS platforms, OS X needs a TARGET_OS_OSX platform so it can be correctly detected without relying on "else assumptions".'
