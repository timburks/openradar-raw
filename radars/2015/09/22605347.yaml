    description: "The Photos app has a reproducible crash when the Filter button is pressed AFTER pressing the Crop button and selecting a desired/random cropping frame BUT not completing the Crop operation by pressing Done. At this point, when the Filter button is pressed, the Photos app crashes and dumps a crash report for com.apple.mobileslideshow or com.apple.camera.\r\n\r\nCrash does NOT happen if (a) the Revert button is pressed after an unfinished Crop and then the Filter button is pressed, or (b) the Revert button is pressed on a Photo taken with no filter selection, or (c) the cropping frame is NOT changed and the Filter button is pressed on a Filtered photo, or (d) images saved from browser, etc., which are without filters. \r\n\r\nSymbolicated crash log for iOS 8.4.1 included with this bug report.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps below are done in Portrait mode:\r\n1. Tap the Camera button\r\n2. Tap the Filter button on the bottom right-hand corner\r\n3. Select filter (e.g. Chrome, Process, etc.)\r\n4. Now take a Photo\r\n5. Tap the thumbnail preview on the left\r\n6. Tap the Edit button\r\n7. Tap the Crop symbol button next to Cancel on the bottom left\r\n8. Select a random cropping frame (e.g. just reduce from the top...)\r\n9. Press the Filter symbol button next to the Crop symbol button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Crop should complete and then switch over to Filter, without crashing obviously; just the way it works when working on a reverted/original unfiltered photo.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash happens and the iPhone returns back to the Home screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5s (iPhone6,2), 16GB model, iOS 8.4.1 (12H321)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame crash is reproducible in the iOS Simulator (for iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nCrash noticed on iOS 8.4 (12H143) and iOS 8.4.1 (12H321); reports come from Camera.app or MobileSlideShow.app depending on how it was triggered (by taking a new filtered Photo or browsing an existing filtered Photo, respectively)"
