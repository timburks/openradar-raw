        Summary:
        When compiling my Apple TV app, linking several other frameworks, compilation fails with the error “Include of non-modular header inside framework module ‘Framework’”. This is a regression from Beta 1, and only occurs when building the Apple TV app. iOS and watchOS targets build fine (also linking against the same framework).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create a project with an Apple TV target.
        - Create a framework, add an Objective-C file and expose its header file (setting it as public and #importing it from the Framework.h header file.
        - Link the framework from the Apple TV target.
        - Compile apple TV target.

        Expected Results:
        It builds fine, like it did in beta 1.

        Actual Results:
        Build fails with the error “Include of non-modular header inside framework module ‘Framework’”.

        Regression:
        This is a regression from beta 1…

        Notes:
        I can’t begin to express how sad it makes me to find something new broken in Apple tools every single day.
