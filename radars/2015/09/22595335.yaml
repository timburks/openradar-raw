    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an app containing a GLKView returns from background into split-screen mode the GLKView fails to make the framebuffer complete due to a failure in the binding of its EAGLDrawable. The following messages are printed to the console:\r\n2015-09-06 14:05:30.649 LTViewUser[2781:2282448] Failed to bind EAGLDrawable: <CAEAGLLayer: 0x14ee97fa0> to GL_RENDERBUFFER 1\r\n2015-09-06 14:05:30.649 LTViewUser[2781:2282448] Failed to make complete framebuffer object 8cd6\r\n\r\nAs a result of this failure the next call to glkView:drawInRect: (on the GLKViewDelegate) obviously fails to draw  due to the lack of a framebuffer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a GLKView to the view tree. \r\nSet its autoResizingMask to (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight) and its enableSetNeedsDisplay to YES.\r\nFrom the viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: method of the VC invoke setNeedsDisplay on the GLKView.\r\n\r\nRun the application on an iPad with iOS 9.\r\nSend it to background and open another app (Notes for example), now reopen the app into split screen .\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDrawing to the GLKView succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDrawing to GLKView fails and two error messages are printed to the console.\r\n2015-09-06 14:05:30.649 LTViewUser[2781:2282448] Failed to bind EAGLDrawable: <CAEAGLLayer: 0x14ee97fa0> to GL_RENDERBUFFER 1\r\n2015-09-06 14:05:30.649 LTViewUser[2781:2282448] Failed to make complete framebuffer object 8cd6\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2"
