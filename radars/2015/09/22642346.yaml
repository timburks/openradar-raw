        Summary:
        App Transport Security makes it impossible to develop using self-signed sertificates unless I edit Info.plist and add
        NSAllowsArbitraryLoads=YES
        But I donâ€™t want to do this globally, only for specific development server.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a

        Expected Results:
        There should be a way to specify NSAllowsArbitraryLoads=YES for specific domain.

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
