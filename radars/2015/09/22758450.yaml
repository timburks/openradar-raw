All services are unavailable and Server.app won't let me login anymore at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave an OS X Server 4.1.5 running, upgrade to 5.0.3 via Apps Store. Launch 5.0.3. Try to login with your usual Server admin user login.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected being able to login, have Server.app update my services and everything running.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nServer.app won't let me login anymore.
