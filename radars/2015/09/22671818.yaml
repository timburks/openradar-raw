    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the \"Add to a Playlist...\" function in the Apple Music app, it presents a modal showing the list of existing playlists for selection. It does not however provide any way to create a new playlist unless there are no existing playlists at all.\r\nThis means that if you decide to add some music to a playlist, activate the \"Add to a Playlist\" function, but then decide that none of the existing playlists are suitable, and you would like to create a new playlist to add the music to, you have to first cancel adding to a playlist, navigate to My Music, then to Playlists, and then choose \"New\" to create a new playlist. Then to add the music that you wanted to add originally, you either can choose to add it from inside the playlist (requiring that you search for the music again anyway), or navigate back to the other part of Apple Music that you were in before when you originally decided that you wanted to add it to a playlist, and then choose \"Add to a Playlist\" again, where you could then select your newly-created playlist.\r\n\r\nThis is an overly-complicated workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose \"Add to Playlist...\" from a context menu activated by the '...' button available throughout the Apple Music user interface.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option to create a new playlist is available from this modal, even when one or more playlists already exist.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo option to create a new playlist from this modal view is available when one or more playlists already exist (option is only available if no playlists already exist)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 [13A341]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S 64GB A1530, WiFi or cellular."
