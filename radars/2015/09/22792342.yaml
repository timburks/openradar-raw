    description: "Summary:\r\nSome methods in AppKit, such as -[NSPathCell _autoUpdateCellContents] contain calls to -[NSURL(BRCloudPathComponent) br_pathComponentDisplayMetadataWithOptions:].\r\n\r\nThis works in 10.10 because CloudDocs.framework, which is where this method is actually implemented gets linked in. But it looks like CloudDocs.framework doesn't get linked on 10.11, and this ends up getting a \"unrecognized selector\" crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun this code on a 10.11 system:\r\n\r\n\tNSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[@\"~/Library/Mobile Documents/2BUA8C4S2C~com~agilebits~onepassword\" stringByExpandingTildeInPath]];\r\n\t[self.pathControl setURL:url];\r\n\r\n\r\nReplace the last part of the path with a valid URL inside of Mobile Documents.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot a crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash. I've attached a real world crash report, as well as one from my sample code, as well as my sample code.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.11.0 (15A282a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression. The crash does not exist in 10.10.5.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHardware seems irrelevant. Only OS X version.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/2m013E1y1s2W"
