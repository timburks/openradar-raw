        Summary:
        It would be really useful for code localisation to allow for property observers (willSet, didSet) to be applied in extensions and even more than once (without any specific restriction on the order they will be ran in).

        e.g.

        class Foo {
          private var foo: Int = 0
          private var count: Int = 0
        }
        //MARK: notifier
        extension Foo {
          overload var foo: Int {
            didSet { print(“foo is now \(foo)”) }
          }
        }
        //MARK: counter
        extension Foo {
          overload var foo: Int {
            didSet { count++ }
          }
        }
