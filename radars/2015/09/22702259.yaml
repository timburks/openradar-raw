    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the status bar animates it's frame change (i.e. in-call, personal hotspot) views that are positioned using Auto Layout will not animate properly, but views that are positioned using auto resizing masks, translated to constraints, will.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen on multiple third party apps as well as Apple applications, for example the calculator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project.\r\n2. Run the application on the simulator.\r\n3. By taping the screen you can switch between two view controllers, both with a footer view, the red one is using auto layout constraints, the green auto resizing masks.\r\n4. Toggle the in-call status bar (CMD+Y) on both view controllers and see the difference\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe footer view should be always at the bottom even during the animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the auto layout view controller (red) the footer view jumps up before sliding down.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 and 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone or Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/eb4ms82fijv7pp7/InCallStatusBarAutoLayout.zip?dl=0"
