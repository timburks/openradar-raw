    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing Auto-Renewing Subscriptions, my client's medical reference app will occasionally turn on a free trial around industry conferences, as a form of promotion and incentive to download.\r\n\r\nHowever, the app has no knowledge of whether the free trial is active and if so, for how long. As such, we're not able to dynamically adjust our UI to entice users to proceed with the IAP.\r\n\r\nOnly when the user has already decided to perform the IAP, does the App Store dialog indicating that they will have a trial period, actually show up.\r\n\r\nSure, we can customize the IAP description and we do dynamically display that in our UI.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we had some additional properties on SKProduct that exposed more of the iTunes Connect configuration, such as:\r\n\r\n- (BOOL)freeTrialEnabled;\r\n- (NSTimeInterval)freeTrialDuration\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
