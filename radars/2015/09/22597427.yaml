    description: "Summary:\r\nThe old version of Notes allowed a user to sort notes in a folder by title; the new version only has the option for notes to be sorted by last updated. This is a regression and an unneeded simplification. Many users would like to scan their notes visually; date ordering means that this is impossible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Notes and be sad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotes on OS X and iOS should allow the user to sort notes in a folder by title.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis option is no longer available."
