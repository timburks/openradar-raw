    description: "See the attached sequence of window screenshots. The Finder window is in column display, arranged by date added.\n\nIn screenshot #1, the last file (folder, really) in the Today section of the Downloads folder is selected. Everything looks right. \n\nOutside the finder, a new file, “document-0-4.pdf”, is saved into the Downloads folder, resulting in the situation shown in screenshot #2. The file’s presence is reflected in the Finder, but you can see that there is insufficient space between the separator bar above Yesterday and the filename; the descender of the p is missing.\n\nScreenshot #3 shows this same situation after clicking on document-0-4.pdf. This shows the insufficient lower margin more clearly since there is no blue highlight below the bottom of the text.\n\nScreenshot #4 shows the result of clicking away to another folder and going back to Downloads. Now everything displays correctly.\n\nThis is 100% reproducible for me."
