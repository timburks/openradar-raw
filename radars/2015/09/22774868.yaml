        This app locks up the iPad when started:

        https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crux-crosswords/id409309617?mt=8

        The app freezes at its launch screen indefinitely. Neither home-click or home-double-click provides a way to move away from the app. Fortunately, putting the iPad to sleep and waking it up again gets you back to the Springboard.

        I understand that the app is probably doing something wrong and that iOS 9 compatibility is the developer’s problem. But isn’t there an iOS watchdog timer that’s supposed to prevent an app from locking up the whole system like this?
