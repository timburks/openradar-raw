    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached sample application tries to determine whether the current device has a PIN/passcode set by writing an item to the keychain with the kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly attribute set, and then reads it back.  If the read-back is successful, the device has a PIN/passcode set.  This code works great on iOS 8, but on iOS 9 beta 5 I see spurious error return codes from the keychain API including errSecDuplicateItem and errSecParam.  Additionally I see numerous console error messages from securityd along the lines of \"SecDbRecordChange db <SecDbConnection rw open> changed outside txn\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip and build the attached sample app.\r\n2. Run the sample app on an iOS 9 beta 5 device that has a device PIN/passcode set.\r\n3. Tap on the \"Run Test\" button to start a timer loop executing the code in question every 0.1 seconds. \r\n4. Observe the device console log while running the app over an extended period.\r\n5. You can also set a breakpoint in the error cases in the method devicePINStatus in UIDevice+DevicePIN.m\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ndevicePINStatus should *always* return DevicePINStatusEnabled, and there should be no error messages in the console logs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn an iOS 8 device this runs perfectly.\r\nOn an iOS 9 meta 5 device I see spurious errors from the keychain API\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9 beta 5 device is an iPad Air 2, iOS 8 device is an iPad 2 WiFi running 8.4.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DocTest2.zip' was successfully uploaded."
