    description: "Summary:\nI’m currently unable to update OTA my Apple TV to Beta 2.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Go to settings -> System -> Software Updates -> Update software.\n- Select “Download and Install”.\n- Wait for download to finish.\n- When prompted “Apple TV Update” select “Update Now”.\n\nExpected Results:\nUpdate installs successfully.\n\nActual Results:\nRight after tapping “Update now”, the screen turns black with the white Apple logo, and immediately goes back to the main screen showing an error “Apple TV Update: The update was not successful”.\n\nRestarting the device did not help (I’ve tried this 5 times now over the past 2 days). Note that I haven’t attempted to install through iTunes.\n\nNotes:\nConsole log is attached. It shows the following error:\nSep 24 20:59:53 Apple-TV PineBoard[47] <Error>: #T:[0x16e2d3000] #Error #TVOSSWU : Brain: Error during (null): Error Domain=MobileSoftwareUpdateErrorDomain Code=10 \"Failed to query for assets\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Failed to query for assets, NSUnderlyingError=0x1609f6370 {Error Domain=ASError Code=3 \"Unable to copy asset information\" UserInfo={NSDescription=Unable to copy asset information}}} \n\nThere seem to be other messages about not having a network connection, but that is obviously wrong since my Apple TV just downloaded the update, and I confirmed that it’s correctly connected to WIFI."
