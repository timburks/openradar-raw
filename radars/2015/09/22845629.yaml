    description: "Summary:\r\nPlaygrounds require way too much effort to create. Xcode should behave like a proper modern OS X and allow you to begin editing a playground immediately without choosing a name or file location for it. Then, if you try to close the playground without saving, then you're presented with a save dialog â€” just like in an app like Preview.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Command + Shift + Alt + N\r\n2. Type a name\r\n3. Press enter\r\n4. Wait for the slow save dialog animation\r\n5. Navigate to a folder to save the playground\r\n6. Press Save\r\n\r\nThen you can begin editing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Command + Shift + N (simpler shortcut for creating a playground, since that's something you do way more often than creating a project or workspace)\r\n\r\nBegin editing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 and 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
