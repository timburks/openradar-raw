    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to print out a UIView.transform in LLDB when running on an ARM64 device, LLDB gives a EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a breakpoint in any iOS project running on an ARM64 device (in my case, an iPhone 6)\r\n2. Enter the following command in the debug console: `p (CGAffineTransform) [theView transform]`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLLDB should print out the transform.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLLDB prints out the following:\r\n\r\nerror: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x20).\r\nThe process has been returned to the state before expression evaluation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a project that has a shared breakpoint that triggers this issue. If you build and run the project on an ARM64 device, you should see the EXC_BAD_ACCESS in the console, whereas if you run it on a ARMV7 or the Simulator, it works as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis doesn't happen in the Simulator, or on an iPod Touch 5th gen, but it does happen on an iPhone 6, so ARM64 may be the relevant/contributing factor here.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIViewTransformLLDB.zip' was successfully uploaded."
