    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an emitter's targetNode is set to the scene itself, it does not appear on the scene at all. The default zPositions (0) and the drawing order of nodes in the node tree do not seem to be respected. Please see the attached example project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a background sprite to the scene.\r\n2. Add an emitter to the scene. The emitter's .targetNode should be set to the scene itself.\r\n3. Run. The emitter is not visible.\r\n\r\nNote: the emitter will only become visible if the background sprite's zPosition is set to < 0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe emitter on the screen, on top of the background sprite.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe emitter is not visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A344)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue did not occur prior to iOS 9. The project works fine on iOS 8.3."
