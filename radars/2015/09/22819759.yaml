    description: "Summary:\r\nTextures are not loaded from a texture atlas (placed in the project folder) if it has the same name as an asset in the Asset Catalog. \r\nThe SKTextureAtlas instance is created correctly and the texture atlas file is being generated as well, but _textureDict is not filled up by its textures (shows 0 items).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place a texture atlas (foo.atlas) with several textures in the project directory.\r\n2. Place a texture with the same name as the atlas (foo.png) in the asset catalog.\r\n3. Create an SKTextureAtlas instance - upon inspection, it will have 0 textures.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn SKTextureAtlas filled with its textures.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe SKTextureAtlas instance lists 0 textures.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A344)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn example project attached."
