    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a QR-Code is scanned to download a new Pass, the Webservice is not called correctly. Instead of calling the POST endpoint to register the device, DELETE is called. In addition, in the Pass settings 'automated updates' and 'show on lockscreen' are disabled.\r\nThis makes the whole adding Passes via QRC pretty much useless.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Scan QRC with Wallet App\r\n* Check logs to find out, that DELETE and not POST was called\r\n* Check backside of downloaded Pass and find 'automatic updates' disabled\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* Webservice is correctly called, Pass has 'automatic updates' enabled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe Webservice is not called correctly. Instead of calling the POST endpoint to register the device, DELETE is called. In addition, in the Pass settings 'automated updates' and 'show on lockscreen' are disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 iOS 9.1 13B5110e iOS 9.1 13B5119e\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iOS 9.0, 9.1 beta 1, 9.1 beta 2"
