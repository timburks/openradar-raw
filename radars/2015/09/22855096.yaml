        Summary:
        Xcode 7 shrunk the size of the project name entry in the list of files in the Xcode project. It used to be way bigger and therefore easy to determine that that is the root of the project (at least within Xcode) and it was way easier to hit the click target.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        .
        Expected Results:
        The project name should be a little bit bigger than the rest of the files.

        Actual Results:
        The project name is as big as the other files
