    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22873027\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAs you probably know, it's impossible to buy or even view an iPad-only app on an iPhone. You get a message that it \"is only available on iPad\" with a link to \"Learn More\", and nothing else. It would be nice if I could at least use Handoff to switch to my iPad where I can view and buy the app.\r\n\r\nThis would also be useful for Universal apps, since I might want to check out screenshots on other devices before I purchase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Grab an iPhone\r\n2. Open a link to an iPad-only app such as https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blood-laurels/id882505676?mt=8&uo=4\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHandoff should show an App Store icon on my other devices so I can view the app there if I like.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHandoff is not supported in the App Store.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone, AT&T, 128GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
