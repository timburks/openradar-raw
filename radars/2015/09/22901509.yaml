    description: "The new WiFi Assist feature is helpful to end-users, but can lead to increased data usage and therefore costs. Large enterprise deployments of iPhone may see significant cost increases from data overages resulting from this feature, especially since it is enabled by default on new and updated devices. Enterprise customers utilizing Apple Configurator or other MDM/EMM programs should be able to disable WiFi Assist, to prevent cost increases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iPhone and cellular iPad devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
