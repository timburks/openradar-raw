        CMD-click a *method invocation* in Xcode shows the definition. This is a great feature.

        Could you please consider adding another one: CMD-click on *method definition* shows a menu of the different callers. This would provide complete 2-way navigation from/to caller / definition and improve the overall source navigation experience.

        This feature (navigate to caller) must currently be accessed through a specific menu.

        Thanks!
