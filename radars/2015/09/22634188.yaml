        Summary:
        Considering the huge market of already existing AppleTV devices (up to 3rd generation) it would be wise to adopt tvOS to these devices as well an not rely solely on the new AppleTV hardware. There is already a huge install base to leverage on which would be a huge bonus for current developers. Ignoring these AppleTV hardware generations creates a block to establish another games platform alongside the established and does not help increase APP sales. Please reconsider this support.
