    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the initial URL is App Store link, safariViewController(:didCompleteInitialLoad:) is never called. When the “Open this page in ‘App Store’” alert shows up, the initial loading should have completed so this delegate method should be called, otherwise there is no other way to programmatically know this event.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. See the “Open this page in ‘App Store’” alert show up.\r\n3. Read console logs. Nothing is printed by safariViewController(:didCompleteInitialLoad:) because it is never called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsafariViewController(:didCompleteInitialLoad:) should be called after loading initial URL to App Store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsafariViewController(:didCompleteInitialLoad:) is not called after loading initial URL to App Store.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1A2W1230412M"
