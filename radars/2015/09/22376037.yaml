    description: "Summary:\r\nThis *was* one of the most starred bug for Chromium (800 stars).\r\nWith the help of the community we got this FIXED in Chrome v45.\r\n\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=500144\r\n\r\n\r\nWe NEED Safari WebKit to fix it as well!\r\n\r\n\r\nWheel event should work like other mouse events (click) and fire in the popular\r\n `body,html { height:100% }` case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTest page: http://output.jsbin.com/kapogi \r\n\r\n\r\n/* \r\n * The problem is caused by an element \r\n * bigger than viewport, and body,html\r\n * having 100% height.\r\n */\r\nhtml, body {\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#page {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  width: 50%;\r\n  height: 1000%;\r\n}\r\n\r\nHave an `onwheel` or `onmousewheel` handler on the document.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWheel events like all other mouse events should fire on the sides (the test page shows how click fires correctly).\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter passing the html,body { height:100% } limit the wheel events are no longer fired (on the sides).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions of Safari, all versions of OS X\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHow many dupes must a good man file?\r\nBefore you call him a dev?\r\nYes, and how many times can a man turn his head\r\nAnd pretend that he just doesn't see?\r\n\r\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\r\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind.\r\n\r\nYes, and how many ears must one man have\r\nBefore he can hear people cry?\r\nYes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows\r\nThat too many people have died?\r\n\r\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\r\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIndependent of other hardware of software"
