    description: "Summary:\r\nMail 9.0: Modal UI delay on accepting Exchange invitations\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you accept an Exchange Calendar invitation on El Capitan GM (15A282b) in Mail, the UI “stalls” for a second or two (or multiple) before returning to normal operation.  The stall is modal; the Mail UI does not accept or respond to inputs during that period.\r\n\r\nThis UI stall is an El Capitan regression from prior releases.  There is no corresponding UI stall in Yosemite and prior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1] Mail configured with an Exchange account. (In my testing and reproduction, the mailbox is on Office 365.)\r\n2] Receive a meeting invitation from another Exchange user.\r\n3] Accept or Decline that invitation within Mail, using the action buttons at the top of the message display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe invitation message should immediately vanish from view, the event changes should be written to the mailbox, and the invitation removed from the Inbox.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI \"freezes\" for a second or two (or more).  No UI interaction is possible in Mail during this period. After this variable period of a \"stall\", the UI returns and normal operation resumes: the invitation vanishes from view, the message disappears from the Inbox.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail with Exchange account (personal testing is with Office 365)\r\nMail 9.0 (3094) with El Capitan GM (15A282b)\r\nFirst noticed in DP6 (15A244d)."
