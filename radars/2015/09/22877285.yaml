    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to concatenate three Strings and Integers three or more times, the compiler will fail to parse the expression, because the \"Expression was too complex to be solved in reasonable time; consider breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions\". Instead an error message should be shown to indicate that Strings and Integers cannot be concatenated because + is not defined for String and Integer as arguments\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to compile the sample project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe compiler should return an error that \"Binary operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'String' and 'Int'\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get an error message saying: \"Expression was too complex to be solved in reasonable time; consider breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 (7A218) and 7.1 beta (7B75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SampleProject.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nThe sample project contains the following file:\r\n\r\nlet conversation: Int = 5\r\nlet pollOption: Int = 4\r\nlet user: Int = 2\r\n\r\nlet url = \"/conversations/\" + conversation + \"/pollOptions/\" + pollOption + \"/votes/\" + user"
