        Summary:

        Right now, the Watch simulator doesn’t know about different user notification categories and their actions registered through the iOS app. The only way to simulate notification actions in the simulator is to supply the “WatchKit Simulator Actions” in the .apns JSON. However, this doesn’t support text input actions, among other things. It would be preferable if the Simulator just used the same mechanism as the actual app — UIUserNotificationSettings.
