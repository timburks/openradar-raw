    description: "Summary:\r\nNSComparisonResult is defined as (^NSComparator)(id obj1, id obj2), but it is within an NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN block, so its parameters are autocompleted as non-null, but they should be nullable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Desire to write a sort descriptor with a custom comparator that does something special with nil values (sorts them to the end of an ascending sort, for example).\r\n2. Type “[NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptor” and look at the autocomplete options.\r\n3. Allow Xcode to autocomplete the method +sortDescriptorWithKey:ascending:comparator:, including the comparator block parameters.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe comparator block interface completes as ^NSComparisonResult(id  _Nullable obj1, id  _Nullable obj2) {\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe comparator block interface completes as ^NSComparisonResult(id  _Nonnull obj1, id  _Nonnull obj2) {\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPrior to nullability annotations being available, this was not an issue, because obj1 and obj2 could implicitly be nil or not according to Objective-C conventions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue is not that the autocomplete is wrong. It’s that I think the default parameter annotations of _Nonnull are wrong, and that they should be _Nullable instead."
