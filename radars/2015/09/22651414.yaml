    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Cookie Emoji (\U0001F36A U+1F36A) is frowning. I mean just look at this thing (attached screenshot)! It doesn't look frowning when it's big, only when it's small. Cookies are supposed to be happy! Same problem on iOS and watchOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send a cookie emoji character (U+1F36A) to yourself in a messaging app (iMessage is fine).\r\n2. Look at that tiny frowning cookie!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCookies should be happy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis cookie is frowning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A278b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X, iOS, watchOS"
