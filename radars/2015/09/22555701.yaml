    description: "Summary:\r\nNow in Swift 2.0, you can provide custom name for Objective-C of Swift type but this feature isn’t allowed for Swift enum type. I think it would be great and make Swift and ObjC code looks nicer together\r\n\r\nexample code/case:\r\n\r\n````\r\n@objc(PPTNotification) class Notification: NSObject {\r\n  @objc(PPTNotificationAction) enum Action: Int {\r\n    case Add\r\n    case Delete\r\n    case Edit\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet action = Notification.Action.Add // when use in Swift\r\nPPTNotificationAction action = PPTNotificationActionAdd;\r\n````\r\nFrom the above example code, it has an error ‘@objc enum cannot have a name’. Let’t think if this is allowed, from the example, the Swift code will looks like Swift, Objective-C code will looks like Objective-C and that would be great :)\r\n\r\n(Now I have to choose between\r\ndeclare enum at the outer scope\r\n````\r\n@objc enum PPTNotificationAction: Int {\r\n    case Add\r\n    case Delete\r\n    case Edit\r\n}\r\n```` \r\n\r\nor declare enum as a nested type but have a long name\r\n````\r\n@objc(PPTNotification) class Notification: NSObject {\r\n  @objc enum PPTNotificationAction: Int {\r\n    case Add\r\n    case Delete\r\n    case Edit\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nBoth case make ObjC code looks fine but it make Swift code looks terrible.\r\n\r\n\r\nXcode Version/Build & OS X Version/Build:\r\nXcode 7 beta 6"
