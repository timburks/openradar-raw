        Summary:
        The always connected 4th gen AppleTV with its tvOS is a superb companion for iOS devices. But the connection is severely limited due to its missing MultiPeerConnectivity framework.

        Expected Results:
        Please reconsider and provide the same MultiPeerConnectivity API/framework on tvOS too.
