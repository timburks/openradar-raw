    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen our file syncing application moves a file, the user's Finder view does not update until the folder is manually changed by the user.  Listing the affected paths via another utility (i.e. ls in terminal), show the moved file in the correct location.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install CudaDrive from cudadrive.com on two computers.\r\n2. Log into an account on both computers.\r\n3. On computer 1, create two directories and a file in one of them.\r\n4. On computer 2, view the file in the sync directory and move it to the second directory.\r\n5. On computer 1, look at the original path and new path in finder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file is moved by the application and appears in finder at the new location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file is visible in the original location from within Finder.  `ls` in the original directory shows no files and shows appropriately in the new directory.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe attempted to mitigate the issue by disabling any other file syncing utilties, assuming they were having an effect on the file system.  This did not help.\r\n\r\nThis also seems to be happening in other file syncing applications and is not limited to ours.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\nhttps://www.dropboxforum.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/204350185-dropbox-for-mac-the-file-syncs-but-doesnt-show-\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro running 10.10. There are also several other file sync utilities running: Google Drive, Box, and Backblaze."
