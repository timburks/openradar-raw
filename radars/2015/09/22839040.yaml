    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Swift autocompletion is in progress on Xcode 7.1 beta 2 and I attempt to delete something, about 90% of the time Xcode crashes rather than allowing me to delete things. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start typing something in a Swift file. \r\n2. Wait for some form of autocompletion to show up\r\n3. Realize you spelled something wrong and try to delete\r\n4. Beachball of death\r\n5. Crashola\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDelete things, do not crash. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(see “steps to reproduce”)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI saw a bit of this in the 7.0 GM, but it wasn’t anywhere near this bad. It was more like 10% of the time rather than 90. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI do have Alcatraz installed, but I disabled FuzzyAutocomplete (and when that was crashing I was getting specific notes that it was causing the crashes), and nothing I’m seeing in the stack trace looks like it’s coming from plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE added 9/28/15: \r\n\r\nGoing through my plugins, it's definitely SCXcodeMiniMap causing the issue. Removing that plugin stops crashes immediately. \r\n\r\nI've filed a bug with Stefan here: https://github.com/stefanceriu/SCXcodeMiniMap/issues/71, but he's correct in saying that there's nothing in the stack trace indicating SCXMM is causing the problem, so I'll let y'all figure out who to kick this to rather than closing it myself."
