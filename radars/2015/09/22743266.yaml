        Summary:
        Dvorak keyboard layout in OS X does not work in iOS simulator. This affects productivity of non-standard keyboard developers by a lot.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In system settings, set Region/Language to US/English.
        2. In Keyboard - Input Sources - add Dvorak layout.
        3. Use Command-Space to switch to Dvorak layout.
        4. Launch iOS simulator, find a textfield to type something.
        5. Type something

        Expected Results:
        The resulting text should be that from a Dvorak keyboard layout.

        Actual Results:
        The resulting text is from a Qwerty layout.

        Notes:
        The simulator menu item “Hardware - Keyboard - Uses the same layout as OS X” doesn’t affect the outcome of this issue.
