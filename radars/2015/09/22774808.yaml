    description: "Summary: Since iOS 9, Siri is terrible to use in the car (via Bluetooth microphone/car kit) I must scream into the speaker before Siri hears something (and then say something completely different)\r\nPhone calls are going well, so my Bluetooth speaker isn't broken.\r\nPlease fix it! (iOS 9, Dutch siri)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Try to ask Siri something \r\n2. Siri will not hear you or thinking you're saying something completely different\r\n3. Be disappointed in Siri.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: That Siri does understand you, and can hear you (so: not screaming into the microphone before she hears you)\r\n\r\nActual Results: Siri will not hear you or thinking you're saying something completely different\r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 9/13A344\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
