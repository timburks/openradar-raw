    description: "When going in the settings/downloads a clicking on the arrow to install iOS 8.4, at the end of the download a messages pops up that says\r\n\r\n\"Could not download and install iOS 8.4 Simulator. Authorization is required to install the packages.\"\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/s/tocacudcwe01sn1/Screenshot%202015-09-02%2010.09.48.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nThat message sounds like a prompt box should have come but it didn't. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's useful to know that I always rename my Xcode betas (the App name). If it makes any difference.\r\n\r\nAlso, for what it's worth, if I start the app with\r\n\r\nsudo open /Applications/Xcode7b6.app\r\n\r\nthen when I'm clicking the arrow my Admin password is asked but at the end of the download I got the same error message."
