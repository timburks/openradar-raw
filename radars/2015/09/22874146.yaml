    description: "Summary:\r\nIn older versions of OS X, I believe up to 10.8, Quicklook would automatically fit images to the screen size if the image was a lower resolution OR a higher resolution (this was a nice adaptive way to zoom images to fit, which accounted both for images too small and too big resolution). I believe this either happened by default, or happened with a single tap of the Option key when viewing images in Quicklook.\r\n\r\nHowever, with some of the most recent versions (10.9, 10.10, and 10.11... maybe even back to 10.8) the smaller images do not \"fit to screen\" unless the Option key is held down for the entire viewing session, but even this introduces an unexpected result -- it zooms in too far on images that are greater than the screen resolution, instead of also keeping large images as \"fit to screen\".\r\n\r\nIn earlier versions of OS X the image sizing was such that images smaller than screen resolution were scaled UP to fit the screen, and images larger were scaled DOWN to fit the screen. It was perfect. But at some point this was changed and DEGRADED the user experience. Please bring back the old way of automatic scaling up/down to match screen resolution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect more than one .jpg in the Finder and press spacebar to launch Quicklook. View Quicklook in full screen by either hitting the full screen widget in the corner of the window or typing CMD-OPT-Y on the keyboard. Notice how images smaller than the screen resolution are surrounded by a thick black border (WRONG), and images bigger than screen resolution are scaled down to screen resolution (CORRECT). Now hit the Option key as you view the slideshow, and notice how the smaller images are now scaled up to screen resolution (CORRECT) but the bigger images are now zoomed in too far so that you can't see the whole image at once (WRONG).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that Quicklook would automatically (by default) scale both large and small images to \"fit to screen\". It seems like the vast majority of users and scenarios would want to see images scaled to screen resolution correctly, no matter what the size. Maybe there should be a toggle for this?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSmall images do not scale up to screen resolution or large images get zoomed in too far. This is the worst of both worlds. There is no way (like there used to be) to scale EVERY image to fit the screen resolution.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.9, 10.10, and 10.11"
