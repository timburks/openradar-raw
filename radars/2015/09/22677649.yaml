        Summary:
        I ran into this error while working on ReactiveCocoa, specifically on this extension:

        extension SignalProducer where T: SignalProducerType, E == T.E {
        	@warn_unused_result(message="Did you forget to call `start` on the producer?")
        	public func flatten(strategy: FlattenStrategy) -> SignalProducer<T.T, E> {
        		return lift { (signal: Signal<T.T, E>) -> Signal<T.T, E> in
        			return signal.flatten(strategy)
        		}
        	}
        }

        “Type of expression is ambiguous without more context” was, well, ambiguous.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open attached project (ReactiveCocoa.xcworkspace)
        - Compile ReactiveCocoa iOS framework

        Expected Results:
        Compilation fails in SignalProducer.swift:1100 with a more useful error, explaining which method it’s trying to find for what values of T and E, and ideally showing that it found a similar, compatible method.

        Actual Results:
        Compilation fails with error “Type of expression is ambiguous without more context”, but no more information.

        Notes:
        - The fix was to change the input signal of the closure to Signal<T, E> (instead of T.T).
        - Note that this is in some intermediate state while I was working on a feature, so tests (and possibly other things) are currently broken.
