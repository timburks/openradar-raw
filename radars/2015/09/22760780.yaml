        Summary:
        Impossible to use OS X Server to host App Transport Security compliant content

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to connect to any OS X Server service with an app that is conforming to Apple's new App Transport Security requirements.

        Expected Results:
        No expectations regarding OS X Server anymore.

        Actual Results:
        Apple's OWN so called “Server” OS is absolutely incapable of conforming to App Transport Security requirements.

        Regression:
        This is the case for ANY and EVERY OS X Server release including the just release Server 5.0.3 even when running on the upcoming OS X 10.11 El Capitan.

        Notes:
        Apple should be ashamed of OS X Server.
