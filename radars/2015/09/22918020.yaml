    description: "Summary:\r\nAn ABPersonViewController or ABUnknownPersonViewController presented from a standard UINavigationController loses the navigation bar (and thereby the user can no longer navigate back) after trying to share the presented contact by pressing the \"Share contact\" button. This only happens when running the code on iOS 9, and it doesn't matter if the code was compiled using iOS 8 SDK (using Xcode 6.4) or iOS 9 SDK (using Xcode 7).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a device or simulator running iOS 9, run the QuickContacts sample project (available in Apple's documentation).\r\n2. Select \"Edit Unknown Contact\" or \"Display and Edit contact\".\r\n3. Select \"Share contact\".\r\n4. The share sheet is shown. Notice that the navigation bar is also removed (this doesn't happen before iOS 9).\r\n5. Press \"Cancel\" and try to navigate back, which is now impossible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter dismissing the share sheet that is presented when pressing the \"Share contact\" button we expect the user to still be able to navigate using the back button, that is, not hiding the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user loses the ability to navigate back from the ABPersonViewController after the share sheet has been presented modally, since the navigation bar is removed as soon as the share sheet is displayed."
