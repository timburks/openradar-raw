    description: "f.lux (http://justgetflux.com) is a valuable and insightful addition on OS X, Windows, and (jailbroken) iOS (and Linux).  It tracks the user’s time and location, and adjusts the display’s color balance to offset the sun’s presence or absence.  It increases user comfort, decreases eyestrain, and is a wonderful addition to any platform.\r\n\r\nThis functionality should be available without jailbreaking on iOS.  Please find a way to allow and support f.lux on the iOS platform."
