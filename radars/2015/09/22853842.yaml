    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are using xcodebuild to archive our apps for enterprise and testing purposes, when running xcodebuild from command line, the project is built and archived successfully, however running the exact same task in an OS X app using NSTask results in the attached crash log within the dsymutil command line tool.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Xcode project in Xcode 7\r\n2. Add a framework to the project (May need to be a framework created in previous version of Xcode)\r\n3. Create an OS X App which uses NSTask to archive the app using `xcodebuild -scheme ShemeName archive -archivePath /Users/simonmitchell/AppName`\r\n4. Observe that the build fails on GenerateDSYMFile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app will be built and archived correctly to the supplied archive path\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app is not built as dsymutil crashes with a malloc error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX App built using Xcode 6.4 (6E35b)\r\niOS App created in Xcode 7 (7A220)\r\nxcodebuild command line tools used from Xcode 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated problem : https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/18311\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\nProcessor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5\r\nMemory: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'llvm-dsymutil_2015-09-24-195716_Simons-MacBook-Pro.crash' was successfully uploaded."
