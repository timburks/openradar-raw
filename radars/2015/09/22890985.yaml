        The NSFileManager has a method called – fileExistsAtPath:isDirectory: that is declared as follows in Swift:

        func fileExistsAtPath(_ path: String,
                  isDirectory isDirectory: UnsafeMutablePointer<ObjCBool>) -> Bool

        The second argument should just be a simple Bool in Swift, not an UnsafeMutablePointer<ObjCBool>, which makes the code required to call this method needlessly long and complex.
