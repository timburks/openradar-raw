        Summary:
        In a similar fashion to KVO, allow for property observers (willSet, didSet) to be notified on changes of keypaths and not only direct properties. Of course that would only be allowed for visible properties according to their access modifiers.

        e.g.

        struct Foo {
          var baz: Int = 0
        }
        class Bar {
          var foo: Foo = Foo() {
            didSet base { print(“new baz: \(foo.baz)”) }
          }
        }

        let bar = Bar()
        bar.foo.baz = 2 // this would print
