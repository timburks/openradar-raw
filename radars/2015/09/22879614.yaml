    description: "Summary:\r\nUIKit on iPad Pro should provide an API to determine if a Pencil is likely to be in use. Applications can then use this API to adapt their user interface to optimise it for Pencil input.\r\n\r\nFor example, a drawing app might default to driving its UI and its drawing canvas from finger touches. But if the API indicates that a Pencil is likely to be in use, it could switch to a Pencil-optimised mode where finger touches pan and rotate the canvas while only the Pencil draws.\r\n\r\nThe API could perhaps use the following information to indicate the likelihood of Pencil input:\r\n\r\n* If a Pencil is paired to the iPad Pro,\r\n* If the Pencil is in proximity to the iPad Pro,\r\n* If the Pencil was recently used for input in another app,\r\n* If the Pencil is in motion (i.e. if its tilt is changing as a result of being in the userâ€™s hand).\r\n\r\nSuch an API could be used when an application becomes active, or even while active it the API included notifications of changes to the state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
