        Summary:
        When in “My Music” with the “Albums” layout and viewing an album with a single song but playing from a different album with multiple songs, pressing ⌘+l (Go to current song) the UI to show the current album’s songs is revealed but the albums below are not pushed out of the way

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open iTunes in My Music, displaying Albms
        2. Play a song from an album with multiple tracks
        3. Click an album in the same row with only one song to expand that album’s tracks
        4. Press ⌘+l to expand the track listing of the current album

        Expected Results:
        1. Tracks from currently-playing album are shown without being covered by the albums below

        Actual Results:
        The tracks are shown, but hidden behind the covers of albums below

        Regression:
        I haven’t seen this happen before but that doesn’t mean it’s a regression.

        Notes:
        If you leave the broken UI alone, eventually things will snap into place as the song nears its end, but that’s a whole bunch of different bugs going on there.
