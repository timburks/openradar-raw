        Summary:
        Profile Manager can't be started anymore

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run Server 5.0.3, try to launch Profile Manager.

        Expected Results:
        Profile Manager should launch.

        Actual Results:
        Profile manager crashes and is shown as OFF after a minute or so.

        Regression:
        In Server 4.1.5 Profile Manager at least managed to launch successfully. This is a completely fresh install, so no legacy problems exist.

        Notes:
        There is nothing the admin can do to fix this at the moment.
