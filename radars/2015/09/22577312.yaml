    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I try to read the user’s water consumption from a WatchKit app, I get nothing. Doing it from the iPhone app works, it just doesn’t work from watchOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a WatchKit app that reads water consumption using the same source code as an iPhone app that reads water consumption.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe WatchKit App will receive the user’s water consumption data once authorized from HealthKit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearching for water consumption always returns no results.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o)\r\nwatchOS Version 2.0 (13S5325c)\r\niOS Version 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a sample project for reading water consumption. I found this in my watch’s console output:\r\n\r\nSep  4 11:40:40 Jeffs-AppleWatch healthd[47] <Error>: HDAuthorizationManager: authorization request finished unsuccessfully: Error Domain=com.apple.healthkit Code=100 \"Authorization session timed out\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Authorization session timed out}\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens on both hardware and simulator.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WaterConsumption.zip' was successfully uploaded."
