    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are running into a problem where Xcode 7 beta 6 server doesn't seem to be running the build pre-actions for any bots. We have a scheme setup for unit testing that needs to run a ```pod update``` and then install. It also needs to unzip a directory inside the project structure. Locally these work just fine on all our devices. When the bot checks out the project and runs it these pre-actions never get run. We've created new projects and the same thing happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) create new project\r\n2) in scheme editor create new pre-action script for Build phase with ```sleep 500```\r\n3) run locally and see that system pauses before the actual build\r\n4) create bot on server for said scheme\r\n5) run integrate on that bot\r\n6) see that pre-action does not run and build continues on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npre-actions in build phase should run\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npre-actions seem to be skipped\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nserver:\r\nOS X 10.10.5 (14F27)\r\nOS X Server 5.0.1 (15S2235)\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o)\r\n \r\nlocal:\r\nOS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease let me know if there are any logs I can provide that would help debug this issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
