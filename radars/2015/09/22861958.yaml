    description: "Summary:\r\nOnce Closed Captions + SDH is turned ON under Accessibility in iOS, turning it OFF is not turning off the embedded caption tracks in HLS video, playing in a native app using AVKit/AVFoundation.\r\n\r\nWe also tried setting closedCaptionDisplayEnabled to NO explicitly on the AVPlayer instance, after setting it OFF in Accessibility - it appears to have no effect; closed captions continue to appear in the video on screen.\r\n\r\nWe are noticing this issue in iOS 9.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn Closed Captions + SDH ON under iOS Settings General -> Accessibility -> Subtitles & Captioning \r\n\r\n2. Play HLS Stream with embedded closed captions using AVKit; example stream - https://developer.apple.com/streaming/examples/advanced-stream.html\r\n\r\n3. Now Turn the Caption Captions setting to OFF\r\n\r\n4. In AVKit based app, tap the subtitles icon at the bottom of the video and turn SUBTITLES & CC Off\r\n\r\n5. Observe that subtitles continue to be shown.\r\n\r\n6. Restarting app does not appear to resolve the issue.\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf Closed Captions + SDH is turned OFF in Accessibility, and Subtitles are turned Off in the player, embedded caption tracks should not appear on screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf Closed Captions + SDH is turned ON and then OFF in Accessibility, and Subtitles are turned Off in the player, embedded caption tracks continue to appear on screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A340)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis does appear to work fine/as expected, when playing the videos in Safari. The noted issue is prevalent only in native apps, using AVKit/AVFoundation to render the video.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9 (iPad Air 2)"
