    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an numeric passcode is set for the phone, replying to a third party message through Quick Reply does not cause the keyboard to be dismissed after the reply is sent. This keyboard is overlaid over the passcode screen and remains after the phone is unlocked again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock your phone.\r\n2. Receive a message from a third party messenger.\r\n3. Swipe on the message from the lock screen and press Reply.\r\n4. Authenticate using a passcode or Touch ID.\r\n5. Type a reply and send it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard is dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard is not dismissed and the authentication screen is displayed again. The keyboard is only dismissed after the phone is locked and unlocked.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1 [13A405]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI used Telegram in order to test this issue as no other third-party messengers appear to support Quick Reply. This problem does not occur if the phone lacks a passcode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S, iPhone 6+, and iPhone 5S\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Telegram Quick Reply with Passcode.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
