        Summary:

        objc-runtime allows introspection of a number of things that could be considered compile-time only information, for example some of the property attributes (and indeed the difference between a property and a method).

        It would be useful if the lightweight generics information was similarly available - ie. at runtime be able to determine the class that was specified for a container class.
