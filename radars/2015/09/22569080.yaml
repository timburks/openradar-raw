    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22558802\n\nSummary:\nThe bless command can no longer allow you to boot into an installer environment (Such as the OS X installer). \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Run the following command:\nbless --setBoot --folder /path/to/installerfiles --bootefi /path/to/boot.efi  --label some_label\n2. Reboot and you are now in the OS X installer environment\n\nExpected Results:\nYou reboot and are now in the installer environment that you blessed above.\n\nActual Results:\nThe machine reboots back into the main OS X install instead of the specified\n\nRegression:\nThis occurs every time\n\nNotes:\nThis is an extremely important tool for doing OS system upgrades without using dirty hacks. If bless cannot be fixed, we need a method for booting into the install environment in a non-interactive way.\nAffected install count: 50,000 Mac OS X devices (Department of Education - NSW, AUSTRALIA)"
