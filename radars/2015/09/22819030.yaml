    description: |-
        Choose "Analyze" in Xcode. Instruments comes up with a window "Choose profiling template for:...". Compare it to other windows. It has a grey area at the top that looks like a title bar. But doesn't move the window. It has 3 white areas that look like text/list/content areas (usually not draggable), a click in which makes the window move.

        Please fix this window to behave like every other window on the Mac (meaning if it looks like a title bar, you can use it to move the window with it).
