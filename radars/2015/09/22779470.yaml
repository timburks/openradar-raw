        Summary:
        Contact and Calendar server turn themselves off due to completely buggy config generation in Server 5.0.3.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Install Server 5.0.3.
        Try to launch Calendar or Contacts service.

        Expected Results:
        The service should launch and work.

        Actual Results:
        The service never finishes launching and crashes due to a buggy config generated by Server.app.

        Regression:
        These services did launch in Server 4.1.5.

        Notes:
        It is unknown if the data of calendar and contacts server is lost as well. It is certainly not available to users which means, denial of service and data loss to the users.
