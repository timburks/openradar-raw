    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a SKEmitterNode in iOS 9.0, particles are not being emitted (or rendered to the screen) when the emitter's particleAction is a SKAction that uses the method 'animateWithTextures: timePerFrame'.\r\n\r\nThis works as expected in iOS 8.\r\n\r\nThe attached sample project contains a segmented control that allows you to see:\r\n - a single node with a single static texture (works on iOS 8 and iOS 9),\r\n - a single node with an animating texture (works on iOS 8 and iOS 9),\r\n - a particle emitter, emitting particles with a single static texture (works on iOS 8 and iOS 9),\r\n - a particle emitter, emitting particles with animated textures (works on iOS 8, DOES NOT work on iOS 9).\r\n\r\nRunning the app on an iOS 8 device / simulator and selecting the option 'Emitter - Animating' will allow you to see the final desired outcome of a confetti like effect. Basically falling particles that are animating through a series of textures to give a 3D rotating effect as they fall.\r\n\r\nThe following code is from a single animating node that works as expected in iOS 9.\r\n\r\n    self.spriteAnimation = [SKAction animateWithTextures:self.textureArray timePerFrame:(kAnimationDuration/self.textureArray.count)];\r\n    [self.confettiNodeAnimating runAction:[SKAction repeatActionForever:self.spriteAnimation]];\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever the following code fails to produce emitted particles with animating textures on iOS 9.0:\r\n\r\n    self.spriteAnimation = [SKAction animateWithTextures:self.textureArray timePerFrame:(kAnimationDuration/self.textureArray.count)];\r\n    self.confettiEmitterAnimating.particleAction = [SKAction repeatActionForever:self.spriteAnimation];\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe there is an issue with using animated textures in conjunction with the emitter's particleAction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open provided example app on iOS 8 device or simulator.\r\n2. Use the segmented control to view all nodes / emitters.\r\n3. Notice how all segments selections produce either a single node or particle emitter (static or animating through textures).\r\n4. Open the provided app on iOS 9 device or simulator.\r\n5. Use the segmented control to view all nodes / emitters.\r\n6. Notice how the 'Emitter - Animating' does not render any particles to the screen.\r\n7. Notice that the 'Emitter - Static' will render particles to the screen, but will stop rendering if the user selects another option and then re-selects 'Emitter - Static'.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to see the animated particles being emitted in both iOS 8 and iOS 9 when selecting the 'Emitter - Animating' option in the provided example project (SpriteKitAnimationSample).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAnimated particles are not emitted / rendered to the screen when built for iOS 9.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o) - iOS 9.0 (13A4325c)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus - Model A1524"
