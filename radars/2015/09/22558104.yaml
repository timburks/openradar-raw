        Summary:
        Xcode 7 provides a great feature to get header-like files for Swift source code. This feature is available via the Navigate menu (Navigate → Jump to Generated Interface). However there are 2 restrictions:
        - Once the Generate Interface is displayed, there is no way to switch back to the original source file. There is a "Jump to Original Source" in the Navigate menu but it is grayed out.
        - No shortcut is bound to the "Jump to Generated Interface" action. It is even impossible to bound one manually, as the action does not appear in the Key Bindings menu of Xcode settings.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a .swift file in Xcode
        2. Jump to Generated Interface using a Navigate menu
        3. Once in the Generated Interface, try to go back to original source using Navigate -> Jump to Original Source
        —
        4. Open Xcode Settings -> Key Bindings
        5. Try to add a shortcut for Jump to Generated Interface

        Expected Results:
        3. Jump to Original Source is available
        5. A shortcut can be added

        Actual Results:
        3. Jump to Original Source is grayed out
        5. "Jump to Generated Interface" does not appear in the list so it is not possible to bound a shortcut

        Notes:
        Xcode could use the well-known ⌃⌘↑ shortcut for both "Jump to Generated Interface" and "Jump to Original Source" to allow to switch quickly between source and generated interface. Right now, this shortcut is used to switch between a .h header and it's corresponding .m, which is the same use case, but in Objective-C.
