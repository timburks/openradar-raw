        Summary:
        When compiling a target with SDKROOT=appletvos, the macro TARGET_OS_IPHONE is true.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create an Apple TV target (either app or framework I suppose, but Iâ€™m reproducing this in a framework).

        Expected Results:
        TARGET_OS_IPHONE is either not defined, or false.

        Actual Results:
        TARGET_OS_IPHONE is true

        Regression:
        This makes this macro not usable to be able to compile things only for iOS. In my case, I need to only compile MapKit related code conditionally, and leave it out for the AppleTV version of the framework.
