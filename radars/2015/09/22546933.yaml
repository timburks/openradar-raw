        Summary:
        When calling this: “player = WKAudioFilePlayer(playerItem: playerItem)” the app exists and in console I get “Program ended with exit code: 0”

        URL is correct and can be played with the movie player.

        Expected Results:
        Sound played from the watch

        Actual Results:
        App exits
