Force press to bring up SOURCE option.\r\n4. Select WATCH as source.\r\n5. Select song.\r\n6.  Starts playing....then quits. Sometimes almost immediately, sometimes takes as long as 20 seconds before it crashes.\r\n\r\nRelaunch Music app, Force press, select WATCH as source again, then it works as it should."
