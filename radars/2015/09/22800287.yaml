        Summary:
        Server 5.0.4 deleted existing RSA private key and certificate from Keychain.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have a self generated private key pair and valid CA signed certificate for your server's FQDN in keychain and in use. This was a working setup in 5.0.3. Update to 5.0.4.

        Expected Results:
        Server should keep using your keys and cert.

        Actual Results:
        Server replaced my existing cert with a self-signed one and deleted my existing private key and certificate.

        Regression:
        This did not happen with 4.1.5 to 5.03 from what I can tell.

        Notes:
        This is effectively a denial of service and loss of private keys. If one doesn't have a backup of the keys, this is a loss of digital identity. It's absolutely unacceptable that private keys get deleted without any warning by Server.
