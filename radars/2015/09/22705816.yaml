    description: "Summary:\r\nI wanted to start a station based on the album \"Raw\" but The Ghost Ease (https://itun.es/us/qt8o9), so I clicked the … button and selected \"Start Station\". In the status view, The words \"Unknown Title\" briefly flash, then disappear, and nothing more happens. No station is created. This makes me sad, because The Ghost Ease are totally badass and I want to find more stuff like them!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find \"The Ghost Ease\"'s album \"Raw\" in iTunes. I was in the \"New\" tab. Here's the share link: https://itun.es/us/qt8o9\r\n2. Click the ellipsis button (…) and select \"Start Station\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new station should be created and and should start playing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe words \"Unknown Title\" briefly appear in the status view, then nothing happens. No station is created.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 Beta (15A278b)"
