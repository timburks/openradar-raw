        Summary:
        I'm currently porting a kind of bigger UI-test from KIF (https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) to Xcodes UI testing (it will take about an half an hour to finish). It seems like that the test is not able to finish, as the RAM gets eaten up by the UI testing process.
        In the attached zip is a project that contains a UI-test. When you start it and observe the memory-consumption, you will see that it is steadily growing. In a bigger app like ours, it grows much faster. I also attached a trace-run i made with instruments of the attached project and some screenshots of the memory-consumption that Xcode showed to me.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Start the UI-test of the attached project and watch the memory grow.

        Expected Results:
        The process for the UI-test should not grow in memory.

        Actual Results:
        The process for the UI-test grows in memory.

        Regression:
        -
