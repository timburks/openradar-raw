    description: "Sample project: https://github.com/tmeisenh/mediaserverd_memory_issue\r\n\r\nWhen streaming the included video from a server it is observed that mediaserverd will consume a significant amount of memory that eventually results in memory warnings and crashes. What is interesting is that when you profile the app you will see this app using only a few MB. Yet you'll still get memory warnings and crashes. The crash logs will be for mediaserverd and not this app.\r\n\r\nOn an iPad2 running iOS 8.4.1 playing the video resulted in erratic memory behavior. Each time the video was played it was observed that mediaserverd would consume up to 250MB. Playing the video twice usually resulted in crashing.\r\n\r\nOn an iPad Air 2 running iOS 9.0 playing the video still resulted in memory consumption but it was not as exponential as it was on iOS 8.4.1. Each time the video was played it consumed around 70MB."
