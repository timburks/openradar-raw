    description: "Summary:\r\nAsset catalog size of the Xcode archive is 50% bigger if when I remove iOS 7 Deployment Target.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the sample code \r\n2. Change the deployment target to iOS 7\r\n3. Archive the project \r\n4. Open the the archive and then open the application inside products\r\n5. The Assets.car size is 179kb\r\n6. Change the deployment target to iOS 8\r\n7. Archive the project \r\n8. Open the the archive and then open the application inside products\r\n9. The Assets.car size is 326kb\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Assets.car size of the iOS 8 archive should be more or less the same size of the Assets.car size of the iOS 7 archive. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Assets.car of the iOS 8 archive is 54% bigger \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 (App Store version) \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample project is just to ilustrate the problem. On my real application after archive we went from 136mb to 210mb. This is way more then we would expect. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.0\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ImageCatalogSize.zip' was successfully uploaded."
