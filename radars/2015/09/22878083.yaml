    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have two apps open in multitasking mode. We have a tab bar with more than 8 tabs so it has \"More\" tab visible. We select 7th tab, and push some view controller. Then we resize the area and it goes to \"More\". We resize back to 2:1 and 7th tab is broken - we can see a black screen. When tapping \"More\", our pushed view controller is there, but we can back only to \"More\". Then when we tap 7th tab again, we can never see its root view controller - only the one that was pushed at the beginning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip ExampleProjects.\r\n2. Compile and run WKMoreBugExample1 app in iPad Air 2 simulator\r\n3. Compile and run WKMoreBugExample2 app in iPad Air 2 simulator\r\n4. Open apps in multitasking mode in 2:1 ratio - WKMoreBugExample1 app should be in the left panel, WKMoreBugExample2 in the right panel.\r\n5. Choose \"Tab 7\"\r\n6. Tap \"Push\" button - some view controller gets pushed on navigation stack\r\n7. Resize panels to 1:1 ratio\r\n8. Resize panels back to 2:1 ratio.\r\n9. See black screen on selected \"Tab 7\"\r\n10. Tap \"More\" tab.\r\n11. See view controller that was pushed on \"Tab 7\"\r\n12. Tap back - you are in \"More\" tab list.\r\n13. Tap \"Tab 7\" - you can see view controller that was pushed at the beginning\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can see \"Tab 7\" view controller\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can see view controller that was pushed at the beginning\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n iOS 9 13A340\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttaching screen recording of simulator and 2 example applications that may be used to reproduce a bug.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ExampleProjects.zip' and 'Screen recording.mov' were successfully uploaded."
