        Summary:
        I haven’t been able to take a single Live Photo since I got this iPhone 6s. 3-D touch works fine, and the camera works fine otherwise (both photo and video). However, photos act as normal photos, and don’t play any video when force-touching them. Sending them over to a different phone doesn’t display any live image, however, I’m able to play live photos taken with a different phone.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Buy new iPhone 6s
        Open Camera.app
        Enable live photos (circle appears yellow at the top)
        Take a picture
        Go to camera roll
        Force-touch on photo.

        Expected Results:
        Live photo plays.

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens.

        Regression:
        N/A
