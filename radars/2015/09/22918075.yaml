        Summary:
        When using the Documentation & API Reference window in split screen mode on El Capitan, I would like the minimum width of the window to be smaller than the current setting. I like to have an Xcode project window side by side with the docs window, but even on a 24" external monitor, it takes up nearly half the width of the display. This leaves the project window feeling very cramped, especially if the Assistant Editor is visible.
