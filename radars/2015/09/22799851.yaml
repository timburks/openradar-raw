    description: "Summary:\n\nWe have a medium complex project that has:\n- several build configurations for altering the build regarding different settings bundles or debug/diagnostic options\n— each build configuration is backed by a xcconfig file (see example)\n- a scheme per build config (but when creating the example I recognised that this seems not to be important) \n- several library targets for components \n- one framework target that is referenced by a library target (the lib of the framework is linked by that referencing target). \n\nI attached an example project. I also included the derived data for demonstration.\n\nWhen building with the “Debug” scheme that refers to the standard “Debug” build configuration everything works. \n\nWhen building the “Debug-Problem” scheme which builds the same targets a header of the framework can not be found and the build breaks.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n- take the example project\n- build the “Debug” scheme => should work\n- build the “Debug-Problem” scheme => will not work, albite it is doing the same.\n\n\nExpected Results:\n\nBuilding with both schemes should work and should create the same results.\n\n\nActual Results:\n\nBuilding with “Debug-Problem” scheme does not work, because of missing header file, albite the configuration is the same.\n\n\nNote:\n\nIn derive data for the “Debug” scheme (e.g. “Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator”) the expected files are created (the framework, the app and so one). The folder for the “Debug-Problem” (e.g. Build/Products/Debug-Problem-iphonesimulator) scheme only contains some of those files after building (at least in my original project, in the example it is empty)."
