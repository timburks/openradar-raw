    description: "Summary:\r\nI want to be able to use Int64 where necessary and have it be as easy to use as using Int is. It's my understanding that Int is implicitly converted to an NSNumber when necessary by the compiler.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a dictionary var like [String: AnyObject]\r\n2. Try to add an Int value to the dictionary\r\n3. Try to add an Int64 value to the dictionary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStep 2 should succeed\r\nStep 3 should succeed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStep 2 succeeds\r\nStep 3 fails :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have mostly noticed this with Int64 but the problem may exist with other types that I haven't noticed yet. Really all the numeric types should work the same nice way that Int does."
