    description: "Alright, Imagine this. You're really hyped because you just got the new product from Apple, the iPhone 6s. One of it's new features is the new 3D Touch which let's you press the screen of your phone until it finally bends, but hey, it's 7000 series aluminum so thats no longer a problem. Alright, so you got the new phone, set everything up and then wanna try out 3D Touch. You Peek'n'Pop'n'Peek'n'Pop your thumb away in Safari, Messages. You just like someone from the ads. Cool, huh? You begin peeking everything you can: Web pages, emails, live photos. Now, let's try out new Apps which already support that dope API! You open the App Store and that huge \"Apps for iPhone 6s\" banner pops right into your freaking face. You and your bros sitting next to you want to see what's in there, you press hard on it, but.................................\r\n\r\nSILENCE, COMPLETE SILENCE\r\n\r\nNothing happens. \r\n\r\nYour mind is going crazy. \"Have I done something wrong?\" Your bros are completely afraid \"Did he destroy it?\". Everyone is freaking out. You can hear people crying. \"No, that's not possible\", you whisper to yourself. You're a brave man, you will try it again. But this time, you'll make it better. You imagine you were a doctor in a critical surgery and the only way to help the patient is by 3D touching him. And the name of that patient is \"Siri\". You get your thumb on that screen, press and....\r\n\r\nNothing. Apple Music starts playing \"Only Time\" by Enya. You killed Siri...\r\n\r\n\"That can't be possible... Apple always implements new features into their own services\". You open iTunes Store, nothing. iBooks? Again nothing. Everybody cries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, implement 3D Touch capabilities to the App Store, iTunes Store and iBookstore."
