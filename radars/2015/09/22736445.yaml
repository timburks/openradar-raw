    description: "I have a UIScrollView which has contentSize equal to its main content view size and I also set its contentInset with a big padding (eg. (50, 1200, 40, 900)) and add supplementary views in those padding area\r\nThe scroll view also be able to zoom its main content and supplementary views have the text field/textview in them\r\nWhen one of those text view becomes first responder, I update its inset for avoiding keyboard and call -[UIScrollView scrollToVisibleRect:animated:] to bring that text view visible in screen. Here come the problem, -[UIScrollView scrollToVisibleRect:animated:] method works incorrectly and I can't figure its misbehavior. In my main project, I have inset.left to be 1200 and supplementary view's x origin to be -1150, when I called -[UIScrollView scrollToVisibleRect:animated:], Scroll view bounds X origin will be -2350 but its content inset is -1175 which is weird.\r\n\r\nI try to reproduce the above behavior in sample project but I can't. Although -[UIScrollView scrollToVisibleRect:animated:] still misbehavior."
