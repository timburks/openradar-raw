    description: "I got my phone stolen and I got it back thanks to Find My iPhone. I’m extremely grateful for that. It doesn’t mean though that I couldn’t get it earlier. \n\nWhen I got my phone back it was restored and the previous owner (the one who bought a stolen phone) tried to activate it. Despite it the phone was not blocked and what’s more important didn’t report location/warn me that it could be located somewhere.\n\nI would like the phone to be blocked by Find my iPhone right when it’s connected to the internet (either through iTunes on a computer connected to the internet or via WiFi). I would also like it to report location then.\n\nI think it’s gonna greatly impact the number of phones found."
