    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I get a crash on my Mac which then leads to crash reports being auto-generated by OSX, I also get a crash report about system_profiler having crashed.\r\n\r\nDoing some search on the web revealed that another person had the exact same issue, and both of us share one particular detail: We both have \"unsupported\" NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards installed - he a GTX 670, I a GTX 660 Ti, each with 4 GB of RAM.\r\nSee here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6873534?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nSo, it appears that when system_profiler gathers the system information, it runs into unexpected (probably non-set) data and crashes. That should not happen, not even with unsupported but well-working hardware installed. system_profiler is the tool to report issues - if it crashes, it can't report any issues any more.\r\n\r\nSimply running system_profiler (with no extra arguments) from the command line already leads to this crash, as does issuing the command \"Send to Apple\" from the System Information app.\r\n\r\nI have attached both a crashlog of system_profiler and my system report as created by System Information's.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac Pro (Early 2008)\r\n2 x 2,8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon\r\n8GB RAM\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'system_profiler_2015-09-03-180836_xxx.crash' and 'Mac Pro.spx' were successfully uploaded."
