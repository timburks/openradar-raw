    description: "In Swift, `nil` marks successfully finding no value while `throws` means being unable to find a value because of a precondition or runtime failure. Your own compiler error messages (try making a function that throws and also returns an optional, and mark it @objc -- \"Throwing method cannot be marked @objc because it returns an optional value of type T?; 'nil' indicates failure to Objective-C\").\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not followed by the Enum#init?(rawValue:) initializer, which returns nil if it fails to find a matching case for the given raw value, meaning `nil` indicates failure`, which directly goes against the Swift way of thinking."
