    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile iOS devices are updated through OTA channel can sync with iTunes 11.4 (which is the last available version of iTunes for Snow Leopard) and iTunes 12.2.3 (which is the last available version of iTunes for Lion), devices that are updated through iTunes does not sync with these iTunes versions.\r\n\r\nThis makes no sense to the users. If iOS 9, updated through OTA, is perfectly compatible with iTunes 11.4 and 12.2.3, means iOS 9 is compatible with iTunes 11.4 and 12.2.3. The arbitrary limitation (or bug) feels strange and counter-intuitive. \r\n\r\nSome Mac are only compatible till Lion. These users would have to install iTunes for Windows via Bootcamp if they updated their devices through iTunes rather than OTA, just to preserve syncing ability.\r\n\r\nPlease treat iOS 9 devices, whether updated through OTA or iTunes, equally in terms of syncing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Update an iOS 8 device to iOS 9 in iTunes 11.4/12.2.3 (or restore an iOS 9 device \"as new\" in iTunes)\r\n2. Wait till the iOS device attempts to sync with iTunes 11.4/12.2.3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDevice syncs just as iOS 9 updated through OTA.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice refuses to sync and prompts the user to upgrade to a newer version of iTunes, which may not be available for their computer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1 (13A405) or 9.1 Beta (13B5119e) with Mac running OS X 10.7.5 + iTunes 12.2.3 or Mac OS X 10.6.8 + iTunes 11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9.0.1 (13A405) or 9.1 Beta (13B5119e) with Mac running OS X 10.7.5 + iTunes 12.2.3 or Mac OS X 10.6.8 + iTunes 11.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
