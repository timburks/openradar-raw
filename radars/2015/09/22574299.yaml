    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a regression bug introduced in Swift 2. If you have a property \"x\" of a protocol type and you provide a property observer for \"didSet\" in which you call a function that in turn access (doesn't set) a property of property \"x\" it will cause \"didSet\" to be called recursively infinitely until the program crashes. This worked in Swift 1.x and since the property is not set but only read it should not trigger \"didSet\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attacked playground to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"didSet\" should not be called recursively since the property is never re-set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe program hangs with infinite recursive calls to “didSet”.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression in Swift 2%2C as this worked fine on Swift 1.x.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens always on Xcode 7 beta 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'didSetProtocolTypeProperty.playground.zip' was successfully uploaded."
