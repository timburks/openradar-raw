    description: "Summary:\r\nIf 3D Touch is enabled, for buttons at the bottom left of the screen, UILongPressGestureRecognizer is triggered without delivering UIControlEventTouchDown first.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app on a device with 3D Touch support and enabled.\r\n2. Tap A, B, C, D, E sequentially.\r\n3. Long press C, D, E randomly to see the correct behavior and console logs.\r\n4. Long press A, B randomly to see the incorrect behavior and console logs.\r\n5. Disable 3D Touch or move tab bar upward a bit, then repeat 1~4 to see the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince delaysTouchesBegan is NO, UIControlEventTouchDown should be delivered before UILongPressGestureRecognizer is triggered.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttps://cloudup.com/cJJ4cj5r2Az"
