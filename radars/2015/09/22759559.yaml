        Summary:
        Since Upgrading Server to 5.0.3 Contacts and Calendar can't be started anymore. They always turn themselved off again after a moment.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have a Calendar and Contacts server that is able to launch on Server 4.1.5, upgrade to 5.0.3. Try to launch Calendar or Contacts Server againâ€¦

        Expected Results:
        These services should just launch and work.

        Actual Results:
        Both fail to launch and can't be used anymore.

        Regression:
        At least both services were able to launch in 4.1.5.

        Notes:
        Server logs complain:

        Sep 18 19:13:00 robot com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.serviceproxy[2091]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1
