    description: "Summary:\r\n“For layers attached to a view, the view changes the scale factor automatically to a value that is appropriate for the current screen.”\r\n\r\nIt means on 2x screen UIView.layer.contentsScale should bet set to 2.0 by view system automatically. However, it is not true for UIView with custom layer class — it is 1.0. It only becomes 2.0 if UIView’s drawRect(:) is overridden.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Read console logs.\r\n3. Uncomment line 23 of View.swift.\r\n4 Repeat 1~2 to see the correct result.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/3V2x2y1O1M29"
