    description: "Summary:\r\nUnlike before (pre iOS 9.0 and 9.0.1), it is not possible anymore to exit an active FaceTime session by swiping up after double tapping the Home button. It is also counter intuitive to normal behaviour (i.e. being able to end any app by swiping up after double tapping Home button).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Establish FaceTime session with Contact / Friend\r\n2. Double tap Home button\r\n3. Swipe-up on active FaceTime session\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nActive FaceTime session should terminate and FaceTime app should close.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActive FaceTime session does not terminate; FaceTime app doesn't close.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 and 9.0.1"
