    description: "Summary:\nUISlider does not respect the value of semanticContentAttribute.\nRegardless of the semanticContentAttribute the slider has has LTR semantic when running with LTR language locale and RTL semantic when running with RTL language locale. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Add localization for an RTL language (e.g. Arabic).\n2. Configure sliders with playback semantic (UISemanticContentAttributePlayback, the slider should keep LTR direction even when running with RTL language locale).\n3. Run app with Arabic application language or RTL pseudolanguage scheme configuration. \n\nExpected Results:\nThe slider respects the playback semantic and appears LTR oriented.\n\nActual Results:\nThe slider appears in RTL semantic.\n\n\nNotes:\nSample project with a slider with each UISemanticContentAttribute and screenshots of it running in RTL and LTR mode are attached.."
