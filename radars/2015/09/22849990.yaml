        Summary:
        Using nested header directories is often incredibly useful when building large frameworks. It’d be super nice if Xcode could handle that when building a framework.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a

        Expected Results:
        It should be possible to make the header build phase respect the relative nesting of headers, relative to a given folder, or potentially specified individually.

        Actual Results:
        It’s totally impossible. Xcode will just lump every header into the “Headers” directory of the framework, meaning it’s impossible to have Xcode natively handle complex header structures for frameworks.
