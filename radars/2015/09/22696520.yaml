    description: "Summary:\r\nApple TV provides a number of screensavers for the user to choose with their own photos, or with supplied photos.\r\n\r\nMost of the screensavers from Apple TV have carried over to tvOS, however the Photo Wall screensaver is absent\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNavigate to the Settings App on the new Apple TV, or in the tvOS Simulator\r\nNavigate to General > Screensaver\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPhoto Wall should appear as a selectable transition\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhoto Wall is not shown in the list of transitions\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.0 (13T5347I) / Xcode 7.1 Beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Photo Wall screensaver on Apple TV was easily my favourite, and always attracted positive comments when friends came over. It would be a very disappointing loss if the new Apple TV was missing this great screensaver.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV 1080p Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
