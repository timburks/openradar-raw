    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22718754\n\nSummary:\r\nThere are severe performance issues with adding and removing KVO observers on iOS 9. This can be reproduced when many different observers are added to a single receiver with distinct \"context\" values.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing attached example project:\r\n1. Run project on iOS 8.\r\n2. Run project on iOS 9.\r\n\r\n(Use a single receiver that observes distinct objects using distinct \"context\" values. Repeat in a loop.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBenchmarks are similar between iOS 8 et iOS 9\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe time needed to add an observer grows constantly as observers are added.\r\n\r\nWith the attached project on an iPad 2:\r\n- the last operation on iOS 8 takes 1.3 ms.\r\n- the last operation on iOS 9 takes 292.5 ms.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 [13A340] and iOS 9.1 [13B5110e]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExample project can also be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/lpios/SlowKVOPerformance\r\n\r\nSee also this issue on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/KVOController/issues/72\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nReproducible on any device"
