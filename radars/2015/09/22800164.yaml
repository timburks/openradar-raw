        Summary:
        Can't select Certificate for Calendar/Contacts server, Server uses wrong cert.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Upgrade to Server 5.0.4 (from 5.0.3) Contacts and Calendar services can be launched again.

        Expected Results:
        I expect to be able to select the certificate I bought to use with Calendar and Contact services like in 4.1.5.

        Actual Results:
        They now use a server self-signed certificate which can't be changed since Contacts and Calendar are still missing from the certificate config.

        Regression:
        This did work in 4.1.5.

        Notes:
        XPC uses the wrong cert and can't be changed.
