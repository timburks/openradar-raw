    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's easy to forget to end a workout, since I often think about stretching, drinking, or eating a protein bar. It would be awesome if the workout app could detect when you're no longer performing that workout and offer to end or pause the workout for you. It seems that motion data could strongly indicate when most types of exercise are at a break, as they involve regular patterns of movement. This can lead to inflated numbers for workout duration and calories burned\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Workout (walk, elliptical, rower â€“ cycling and \"other\" would be difficult to gauge, other than by heart rate)\r\n2. Stop workout out (sit down, stand still, stretch)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWatch either automatically pauses and gives you the option to end, or prompts you with a question of whether to pause or end\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWatch continues measuring your workout\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 1.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
