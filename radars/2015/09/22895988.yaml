    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a window of time after saving a Preview document, during which closing the document will lead to a hang. The window seems to be larger if the underlying document is longer or more complex, but I have seen the hang happen on documents as simple as 2-page statements from my utility company.\r\n\r\nThe attached PDF is suitably long to make reproducing the hang trivial on my machine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached TestHang.pdf.\r\n2. Quickly press Cmd-S followed by Cmd-W.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document should save and then close.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPreview hangs with attached hang sample.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A282b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2014 edition 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestHang.pdf' and 'Preview_2015-09-29_092809_zIhl.sample.txt' were successfully uploaded."
