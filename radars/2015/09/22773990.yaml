    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems the when using picture in picture, there's no way to programmatically stop it. For example, when launching a video (AVPlayerViewController) in my app, I want to stop PiP from another app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play video\r\n2. Start picture in picture\r\n3. Play another video\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExisting picture in picture would stop\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPicture in picture plays over the top of the new video.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (simulator)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEven if it wasn't automated, a way to stop the video programatically on a kind of sharedInstance of AVPictureInPictureController would be good.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Simulator Screen Shot 20 Sep 2015, 16.09.59.png' was successfully uploaded."
