    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I have two Xcode windows with an editor editing the same file in two spaces it switches the spaces involountarily. It looks like it happens when a matching brace is highlighted in one of editors. (-[DVTCompletingTextView showMatchingBraceAtLocation:] is called). This issue might be relevant to AppKit since the method I mentioned just calls -[NSTextView showFindIndicatorForRange:].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode editor to edit certain file\r\n2. Open the same file in a text editor and move it to another space or fullscreen\r\n3. Edit the file in the new editor\r\n4. Edit it in the first editor\r\n5. repeat... repeat... repeat...\r\n6. Until it happens and bum.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt shouldnâ€™t switch spaces."
