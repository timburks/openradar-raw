        When simulating location on an attached device while debugging in Xcode, location simulation stays active on the device if the USB cable is simply disconnected.

        While this may be convenient in certain cases, in most cases it's not. Unfortunately, there's no easy way (to my knowledge) to stop location simulation on the device other than rebooting the phone.

        So I propose to add a switch or button to disable location simulation in the Developer settings pane.

        Not absolutely needed but nice to have: the ability to also enable location simulation there
