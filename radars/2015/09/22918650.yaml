    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UI Testing's adjustToPickerWheelValue, it fails with \r\n\r\nUI Test Activity: \r\nAssertion Failure: UI Testing Failure - Internal error: unable to find current value 'Foo, 1 of 3' in possible values Foo, Bar, Baz for the picker wheel \"Cheeseburgers\" PickerWheel\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is because the accessibility value of the element is '<TITLE>, 1 of  N' instead of just <Title>, and it expects to find the current accessibility value in list which it doesn't\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a picker whos delegate uses `pickerView(pickerView: UIPickerView, viewForRow row: Int, forComponent component: Int, reusingView view: UIView?) -> UIView`\r\n2. Try to create a UI Test that calls adjustToPickerWheelValue to a value\r\n\r\n\r\nOr run `testExample` in attached Xcode project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should succeed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt fails with\r\n\r\nUI Test Activity: \r\nAssertion Failure: UI Testing Failure - Internal error: unable to find current value 'Foo, 1 of 3' in possible values Foo, Bar, Baz for the picker wheel \"Cheeseburgers\" PickerWheel"
