        Summary:

        The Objective-C generics syntax is non-ambiguous because types must be pointer types and protocols do not have a trailing asterisk. The compiler fails to disambiguate the case where a protocol and class have the same name and both are adopted - ie. when a collection class is known to fulfil a particular protocol and you also want to use generics with that collection.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Compile:

        @protocol Countable
        - (NSUInteger)count;
        @end

        @interface Countable : NSObject <Countable>
        @end

        @interface MyModel : NSObject
        @property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray<Countable,Countable*> * objects;
        @end


        Expected Results:

        Compiles, with compile time generics applied to ensure only objects of class “Countable” are added, and a property that at runtime can be introspected to show that it conforms to the protocol “Countable”.

        Actual Results:

        Compile error:

        error: type argument 'Countable' is neither an Objective-C object nor a block type

        Regression:
        nil

        Notes:

        Demo project attached. Note that objects and protocols of the same name are not uncommon, eg. NSObject and we can see that the name conflict does not in itself introduce a type since we can adopt either the protocol or the generic class, just not both at once - which makes the error even more mystifying since we know that the compiler does indeed know that “Countable” is an Objective-C object.
