        This is a problem that is very hard to reproduce reliably even though it occurs quite frequently because it depends on both client and server.

        Simply put, when communicating with some servers(in my case Sina Weibo Open Platform) with some configuration iOS network frequently enters an state that gives continuous NSURLErrorTimedOut until the network is reset by turning off and on.

        It is very hard to describe. Here is the best I can do: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28904723/how-to-solve-timeout-issues-caused-by-bad-http-persistent-connection.

        Here is a related discussion: https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/issues/2314. As you can see its affection is very extensive.

        It begins since iOS 8 and seems more severe in iOS 9.
