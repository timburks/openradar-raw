    description: "Summary:\r\nxcodebuild sometimes reports errors of the nature \"module file's minimum deployment target is X\" where X is one of \"ios8.4 v8.4\", \"ios9.0 v9.0\", or \"OS X v10.11\" where the reported minimum deployment target is higher than the actual minimum deployment target of the module.\r\n\r\nRetrying the same build command eventually causes the build to succeed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. See this Travis build failure: https://travis-ci.org/paulyoung/MinimumDeploymentTargetBug/builds/81733277#L444\r\n2. To reproduce, clone https://github.com/paulyoung/MinimumDeploymentTargetBug\r\n3. Run ./script/build\r\n4. Repeat #2 until the build fails. If rdar://20490378 is encountered, retry until the expected failure occurs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build does not fail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build fails intermittently.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0 (7A220)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBetween this issue and rdar://20490378 the build failures are so frequent that xcodebuild (and therefore CI) is basically useless."
