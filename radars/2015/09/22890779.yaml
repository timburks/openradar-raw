        Summary:
        In Xcode 6.x, the `xcodebuild exportArchive -exportPath` argument specified the full path of the IPA being written to disk, including the filename. In Xcode 7, the argument to -exportPath only specifies the directory path.

        The xcodebuild 7.0 and 7.0.1 manpages still claim that exportPath “[s]pecifies the destination for the exported product, including the name of the exported file.” This is no longer true, though I wish it was, and I hope it will be again.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an xcarchive
        2. Export it thusly:

        xcodebuild -exportArchive -exportPath path/to/app-build-17-production.ipa -archivePath /path/to/app-build-17-production.xcarchive -exportOptionsPlist adhoc.plist

        Expected Results:
        The exported IPA should reside at path/to/app-build-17-production.ipa.

        Actual Results:
        The exported IPA resides at path/to/app-build-17-production.ipa/name-of-app-target.ipa

        Regression:
        This is a change from Xcode 6.4. It’s also a regression in that it forces build managers to take an extra step to put differentiating context back into the app’s filename, commonly including a build number, and/or a choice of server endpoints.
