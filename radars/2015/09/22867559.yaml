    description: "Summary:\r\nThe text at the top of the screen says \"Bubbish\", I think it is supposed to say \"Rubbish\".\r\n(Though that is not how anyone would actually use the word in UK or Australian English - localising from Trash is not really needed)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Swipe Options\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCorrect spelling of \"Rubbish\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBubbish\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1 (13A405)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus"
