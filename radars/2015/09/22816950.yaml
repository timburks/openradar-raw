    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 9.1 introduces a breaking change in the value that it reports for [UIDevice systemName]. The value changes from iPhone OS to iOS.\r\n\r\n1: Why in a .1 release ?? Doesn't make sense. For a major version change, I can understand.\r\n2: This potentially silently breaks my apps if I simply update and don't go searching through all my code for \"iPhone OS\"...\r\n\r\nWhy not make this returned value depend on deploymentTarget ? Return iOS for deploymentTarget iOS 9 and later, and iPhone OS for earlier deploymentTargets ?\r\nThat seems like a much safer transition strategy to me. Raising deploymentTarget is a much more deliberate decision than updating my SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n[UIDevice systemName]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhone OS\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1: 13B5110e"
