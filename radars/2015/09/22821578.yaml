        Summary:
        Using a category that implements - (UIKeyboardAppearance)keyboardAppearance and returns UIKeyboardAppearanceDark to get the dark keyboard to work with text fields inside a WKWebView results in an incorrectly rendered dark keyboard (see attached screenshots for examples of rendering issues).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use a category on UIView that implements - (UIKeyboardAppearance)keyboardAppearance and have it return UIKeyboardAppearanceDark.  Then load content in a WKWebView with a text field and tap on the form field.

        Expected Results:
        The dark keyboard should appear and render correctly.

        Actual Results:
        The dark keyboard appears but does not render correctly.  Sometimes it shows up initially as the default, lighter keyboard and changes to a visually broken dark keyboard upon interaction.  Other times it shows up immediately as the dark keyboard with rendering issues.  See attached image for examples of rendering issues.

        Regression:
        This works perfectly in iOS 8, but the same issue is present in iOS 9.0, 9.0.1, and the first 9.1 beta.
