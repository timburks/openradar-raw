    description: "The system-wide iOS search field auto-selects previously entered text. So when the user enters search again the previously entered search text is still available but pre-selected, allowing the user to enter a new search without having to delete the old text manually.\n\nI want that behavior for my own apps. I'd like to simply enable auto-select mode by setting a property on UISearchBar.\n\nWhile I can use \n\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] sendAction:@selector(selectAll:) to:nil from:nil forEvent:nil]\n\nto auto-select the text of a focused UISearchBar, the behavior is slightly different: The text selection displays blue begin and end marks."
