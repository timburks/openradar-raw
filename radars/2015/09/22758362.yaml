    description: "Summary:\r\nGroup Calendars can't be activated in Wiki since the checkbox to do so is greyed out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuy 10kâ‚¬ of Apple hardware\r\nInstall Yosemite 10.10.5 and every other available Update on that Mac mini.\r\nCreate keys and install certificates.\r\nVerify that FQDN in DNS is working correctly.\r\nInstall Server.app 4.1.5\r\nRun it to install the server components.\r\nCreate a group and users.\r\nActivate Wiki and Calendar.\r\nLogin to Wiki, go to Wiki Settings to activate a group calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCheckbox for Calendar should be black and selectable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalendar Check Box is always greyed out. Using Group Calendars is impossible in Server 4.1.5.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n4.1.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression:\r\nThis mostly worked acceptable in OS X 10.6.8 Server, 10.8.5 server and 10.9.x server. At least is was possible to activate group calendars for a Wiki.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a clean setup on freshly unpacked Apple hardware. Not a single bit had been migrated from anywhere else as that doesn't work anyway.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nYosemite 10.10.5, Server 4.1.5, Newly purchased mini 2015, 256SSD, 16GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
