    description: "Summary:\r\nLogic Pro 9, GarageBand 6 and previous versions of OS X Server disappeared from 'Purchased' tab for users who previously bought the software, without any prior warning to the users.\r\n\r\nIf intended, this seems to break the implicit trust about purchased apps. The 'Purchased' tab is expected to replace the experience of \"having box with disc inside sitting on the shelf.\" \r\n\r\nUsers paid for such software, and may still need such software in their workflow, as many features are removed from updated versions (Podcast support and Magic GarageBand, just to name two). Some of the newer versions may also be incompatible with users' devices.\r\n\r\nConsidering Mac App Store's huge traffic flow, the bandwidth requirement for hosting these downloads are practically negligible. Even for users who had legally bought such software, they would have to look for third party sources to re-download a copy. Considering the very recent XcodeGhost malware distribution event, downloading from a questionable source is not only illegal, but also very, very dangerous.\r\n\r\nPlease put these software back into the 'Purchased' tab for users who bought them, whether if their disappearance is a bug or intended.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the 'Purchased' tab of an Mac App Store account that previously bought Logic Pro 9, GarageBand 6, OS X Lion Server, OS X Mountain Lion Server or OS X Mavericks Server.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers are able to see their purchase history of such app or system add-on, and are allowed to re-download them if needed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsers are not able to see their purchase history of such app or system add-on, and are not allowed to re-download them if needed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny version of OS X with Mac App Store support\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny version of OS X with Mac App Store support\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
