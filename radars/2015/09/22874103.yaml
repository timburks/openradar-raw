    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I use Quicklook to play a selection of .mp4 videos (say, 3 video clips) then instead of the videos continuing to play back-to-back on repeat, each video pauses when it reaches the end. In previous versions of Mac OS (I believe this may have changed in 10.8) the videos would continue to play in Quicklook, in sequential order, in perpetuity, such as what happens when you select some .jpg still images.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect more than one .mp4 video clip in the Finder. Press spacebar to launch Quicklook. Notice how the playback stops once the first clip is done.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter the first video plays in Quicklook, the second video should automatically start playing, etc etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayback stops after the first video ends, even though multiple videos are selected in the Finder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS 10.10 and 10.11, maybe earlier 10.9\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro 15\" 2010"
