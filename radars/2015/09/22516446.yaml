    description: "Summary:\r\nThe property currentCalls of a CTCallCenter object must always reflect the current situation with phone calls. However, it's no longer being updated if another property of CTCallCenter is set - callEventHandler\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an instance of CTCallCenter (single instance to be used throughout the app).\r\n2. Initiate an incoming phone call when the app is running, and log the value of currentCalls property - it will be correct.\r\n3. Hang up the phone call and log currentCalls - it will be correct.\r\n4. Now set callEventHandler property to a non-nil value (some block).\r\n5. Repeat (2) and (3), and after that the currentCalls property will still contain an active call although no call is in progress.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncurrentCalls must be updated properly regardless of whether callEventHandler is set or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter the phone call is over, currentCalls is NOT updated if callEventHandler is set.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem was also seen by other people. See e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26404449/ctcallcenter-doesnt-update-the-currentcalls-property-after-i-set-calleventhandl"
