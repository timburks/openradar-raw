    description: "Summary:\nServer.app fails to create private key file upon .key and .pem (certificate) import. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nIn Server.app go to Certificates section, klick the + button to import a trusted identy.\nImport an RSA .key private key file, and a certificate in .pem format.\nAlso drag the intermediate certificate of your signing CA into the import dialog.\nKlick import.\n\ncheck if there are four entries in /etc/certificates.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe certificate and private key should be fully imported and in a usable manner to be activeated for somewhat securing services with Apple's hideously crappy TLS 1.0 to avoid plaintext.\n\nThese files should exist in /etc/certificates\n-rw-r--r--    1 root  wheel      2849 Sep 29 23:11 hostname.example.com.36BE48F8059567B81C4CC3B41B33B237D4EF4702.cert.pem\n-rw-r--r--    1 root  wheel      7821 Sep 29 23:11 hostname.example.com.36BE48F8059567B81C4CC3B41B33B237D4EF4702.chain.pem\n-rw-r-----    1 root  certusers  2849 Sep 29 23:11 hostname.example.com.36BE48F8059567B81C4CC3B41B33B237D4EF4702.concat.pem\n-rw-r-----    1 root  certusers  3272 Sep 29 23:11 hostname.example.com.36BE48F8059567B81C4CC3B41B33B237D4EF4702.key.pem\n\nThe .concat.key file should consist of a certificate and an encrypted RSA private key PEM part.\n\n\nActual Results:\nThe .key.pem file is not created by Server.app.\nThe concat file does not contain the private key part.\nThis certificate can't be used to secure services even though Server.app shows it as being selected.\n\n\n\n\nRegression:\nThis did work in 4.1.5 it'c completely broken in Server 5.\nServer 5 is unusable due to lack of working encryption if you still dare to call Apple's crappy TLS 1.0 cipher suites encryption.\n\n\n\nNotes:\nCan not be fixed manually since I can't generate an encrypted private key file that Server.app actually will understand and use.\nResult: It's not possible to secure services with TLS in a so called OS X “Server”."
