    description: "If I use Siri to create a reminder and say something like \"Remind me in an hour take a shower\" and Siri hears \"Remind me in an hour to take a flower\", and then I tap the word \"flower\" and correct it to \"shower\" the corrected reminder will be shown on the input screen. However, if I then go to the Reminders app I will see TWO reminders. One to \"Take a flower\" and another to \"Take a shower\". This is not expected behavior. There is no point to creating an incorrect reminder! That negates the entire reason for correcting Siri's input.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse iOS 8 or iOS 9, hold down the home button to activate Siri. Use voice input to create a reminder, then while still in the Siri input screen, tap the input where it says \"tap to edit\" and correct her interpretation of your input (pretend it's wrong even if it's not). Then click the \"Done\" button on your keyboard. Siri will repeat the newly corrected reminder to you. Now go to the Reminders app, and you will see two reminders -- an incorrect one, and the corrected one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that ONLY the corrected reminder will be created.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo reminders were created, one incorrect, one corrected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBoth iPhones were set up as completely new (erased and flashed with latest iOS version). Previously I had gone to the Apple Store Genius Bar and described the problem to them, and they blamed it on something in my iOS software being corrupted (the Springboard). But now that I have completely erased that phone and restored it with a fresh iOS, AND I now have a 6s Plus with the same problem, it is clearly a bug within the OS itself (which I have seen since iOS 8, but do not remember seeing on iOS 7).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s and iPhone 6s Plus"
