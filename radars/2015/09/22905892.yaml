    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen enabled in settings, please limit phone use to parents, messages and emergency services and establish limited game-play time from 0 minutes to 60 in 10 minute increments. It would be great if the option hid all apps during grounded time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYell. Frown. Point at room.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSulky teenager.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSurprisingly enough, a sulky teenager. Enhancement would not change that.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWAIT UNTIL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS, any hardware\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nPossibly not as strong as when they were a toddler"
