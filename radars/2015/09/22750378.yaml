        Summary:
        The default font size in the Notes app is too small, and this carries over to iOS in some notes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a new note in Notes on El Capitan.  Look at the tiny font size.

        Expected Results:
        The default font size in Notes I would expect is something very similar to the size of the default system font size.

        Actual Results:
        Fontâ€™s too small, and it affects notes on iOS.

        Regression:
        N/A
