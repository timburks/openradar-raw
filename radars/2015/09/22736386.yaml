    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Open In\" buttons no longer appear when opening a Word document in Safari (or in third party browsers such as Chrome, Mercury and iCab). Similarly, the share sheet provides no apps to download the document. This is the case for both .doc and .docx files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Navigate to a website and tap on a link to open a Word document\r\n3. No \"Open In\" menu appears, and the share sheet does not show any apps which can download the document (it treats it as a weblink). \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document should load in the browser and an \"Open In\" option should appear just below the address/tab bar. Normally if the menu fades away, tapping the document brings it back. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo \"Open In\" menu appears, and tapping the document does nothing. The document can only be viewed in the browser; it cannot be downloaded.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am an IT staff member at a university, and many of our students only own iPads. This makes it impossible for them to download critical documents, and will make their experience using the iPad at school extremely frustrating. Please fix this as soon as you can!"
