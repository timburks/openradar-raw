    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIImagePickerControler/camera can hang for up to a minute or longer when the camera reinitializes after returning from the background while the camera is fully zoomed and the AE/AF lock is engaged. \r\n\r\nThis happens in the default iOS camera app as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the iOS camera app and use the back-facing camera\r\n2. Pinch zoom such that the camera is fully zoomed in\r\n3. Turn on AE/AF lock by holding somewhere on the camera\r\n4. Press the home button and then return to the camera app\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe camera does not hang.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe camera view may hang with only a black screen displayed for some time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad: 8.1.2 (12B440), iPhone: 8.3 (12F69)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 3,4 and iPod 5,1\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
