        Summary:
        OpenDirectory completely trashed after restart

        Steps to Reproduce:
        System should reboot normally. System hung completely during shutdown. Hard reset was necessary.

        Expected Results:
        Even after a hard reset the OD server should stil _exist_ and actually should be working.

        Actual Results:
        OD is completely evaporated. No users is known. OD can't even be launched anymore.

        Regression:
        This happened to me once with Server 4.1.5 but I was able to demote the OD, create a new one and restore from a backup. With Server 5. there seems no way to actually restore an OD from an archive. Also, this is only possible when OD actually starts up which is not the case now.

        Notes:
        serverdiagnose -w output attached.
