    description: "Summary:\nDocumentation for UIButtonTypeSystem does not define selection behavior, which is that the background will be the tintColor of the button. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Add a UI button to a storyboard, do not change its type to UIButtonTypeCustom from the default UIButtonTypeSystem\n2. Add code which selects the button. \n3. Build & Run, note that the system button creates a background for itself matching the tint color when selected. \n4. Get confused by this, look at the UIButton docs for tintColor and UIButtonType system, see nothing. \n5. Look at the HIG, see nothing. \n\nExpected Results:\nDocumentation of UIButtonTypeSystem should note this behavior of the selected state. \n\nActual Results:\nDocumentation notes this behavior nowhere. \n\nRegression:\nThis has been the case since iOS 8. \n\nNotes:\nPlease see attached behavior in sample project. I have also attached dated screenshots of the current documentation."
