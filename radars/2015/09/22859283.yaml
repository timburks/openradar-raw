    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to use the UIImageEffects sample code to blur a specific image, the function ImageIOCalculateRowBytesAndBlockHeight () sends a message to a deallocated CFDictionary. This causes a crash on debug builds with Zombie objects turned on. The entry point into the framework code is at vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage.\r\n\r\nThe code also crashes when using the image titled \"generic-book-cover.png\" in addition to \"nocover.png\".\r\n\r\n\"nocover2.png\" also crashes. (This file is a Finder-duplicated copy of \"nocover.png\")\r\n\r\n\"nocover3.png\" also crashes. This file was re-exported with the Preview app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open UIImageEffects project.\r\n2. Run\r\n3. Wait a moment, observe crash.\r\n4. Switch images by changing the file loaded at APLViewController.m:72 inside viewDidLoad\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBlurred image of the cheetah in the DisplayImage file.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nException breakpoint.\r\n\r\nAlso crashes on device\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A340)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.0, iPhone 6 simulator, iOS 9.0 \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIImage Effects crash stack shot.png' and 'UIImageEffects crash example.zip' were successfully uploaded."
