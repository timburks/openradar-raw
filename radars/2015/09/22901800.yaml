        Summary:
        Server 5.0.4 makes EVERY user an Admin

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run an OD master.
        Create a new user.
        Do NOT tick the “can administer this server” checkbox.
        See the User list. It shows every newly created user as admin.

        Expected Results:
        User's should never be admins by default.

        Actual Results:
        You become an admin!
        And YOU become an admin!
        Everyone becomes an admin.

        Regression:
        This wasn't present in 4.1.5.

        Notes:
        With every user being an admin, OS X “Server” is the ultimate anarchism system.
