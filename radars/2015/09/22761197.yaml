        Summary:
        Server 4.x.x violates RFC 7465 by offering RC4 as cipher

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Configure any OS X Service with TLS. Test offered service suites, for example with nmap.

        HTTPS: nmap --script ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 osx.example.com
        But the same issue applies for ANY service that is offered by ANY OS X Server version. This includes XMPP, Web, Wiki, Email, Calendar, Contacts, Profile manager, anything.

        Expected Results:
        TLS Handshake must fail.

        Actual Results:
        OS X happily offers insecure RC4 cipher suite which violates TLS standards 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.

        Regression:
        This should have been fixed in Server 4.0.x, 4.1.x already. It is still present in Server 5.0.x running on any of Yosemite or El Capitan.

        Notes:
        RFC 7465
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7465

        TLS clients MUST NOT include RC4 cipher suites in the ClientHello message.
        TLS servers MUST NOT select an RC4 cipher suite when a TLS client sends such a cipher suite in the ClientHello message.
