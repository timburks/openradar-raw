        Summary:
        Xcode 7 introduces ObjC generics and __kindof, however the refactoring tools have not been updated with support. Result is, when renaming a class and compiling, there are compilation errors on casting, generics, __kindof.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a class
        Cast an instance of an object to that class.
        Declare an NSArray of __kindof that class objects.
        Rename the class

        Expected Results:
        All uses of the class name should be renamed to the new name

        Actual Results:
        Some cases are handled, while others are not.

        Regression:
        This happens on all Xcode 7 betas
