        Summary:
        Indetermined Progress bars (Barber poles) impossible to see

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have any process show an indeterminate progress bar. Formerly these were also known as Barber-Poles.

        Expected Results:
        One should be able to see that the progress bar is of indeterminate nature and that it is still doing something.

        Actual Results:
        There is a blue or grey line. It's impossible to see anything moving even for the sighted.

        Regression:
        This worked excellently in OS X up to 10.6, it got worse in 10.8 and it's absolutely impossible to see anything in 10.10 and higher. The same applies to iOS where the line is even less visible.

        Notes:
        The same problem whether you're using the blue or the graphite theme.
        Please have your UI Designers read the Macintosh HIG again, preferably an old one back when Apple still did UI/UX for people and not to have designer get off.
