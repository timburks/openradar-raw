    description: "Summary:\r\nThe WWDC app is written to use 100% Public API, and is non-trivial. It would be a great example of Appleâ€™s blessed way of doing this.\r\n\r\nThis app has lots of interesting framework applications, from CloudKit to NSOperation (as Dave DeLong mentioned in his Advanced NSOperations talk) to HTTP streaming to multi-device state synchronization with favorites. Even though this app isn't trivial, it seems pretty straightforward, so it doesn't seem like there would be many trade secrets you would expose (as long as you keep the CloudKit keys private)."
