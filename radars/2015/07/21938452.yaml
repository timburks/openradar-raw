    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Remote Command characteristic of the Apple Media Service (AMS) can be subscribed to, to get notified about the supported commands that can be written to the Remote Command characterstic.\r\n\r\nThis seems to work OK once, upon subscribing, but when the set of supported commands changes (when the active media player changes), these changes are not notified again. Never, in fact, until the characteristic is re-subscribed to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Music app and play some music\r\n2. Connect BLE device with AMS client to iOS device\r\n3. Let AMS client subscribe to Remote Command (RC) characteristic\r\n4. Observe a notification will be sent for the RC, with the commands that Apple Music supports.\r\n5. Open Apple Podcasts app and play a podcast (this app has a different set of supported commands, compared to Apple Music)\r\n6. Observe that NO notification will be sent for the RC\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 6, a new notification for the RC should be sent with the command set that the Apple Podcasts app supports.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn step 6, NO notification for the RC is sent, even though the supported command set has changed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 3 (13A4293g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 (A1429)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
