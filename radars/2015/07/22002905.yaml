    description: "Summary:\r\nTwice I've seen iCloud Photo Library get stuck with the status message 'X photos to upload'. In both cases the phone failed to sync for days on end (the second time I contacted support after 5 days).\r\n\r\nThis seems to be related to the connection to the server - in one case, a software update resolved the issue; in the second, disabling and renabling iCloud Photo Library resolved it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnsure. The second time the process was:\r\n\r\n1. Take photos and sync library.\r\n2. Put phone in Airplane Mode.\r\n3. Edit photos.\r\n4. Take phone out of Airplane Mode.\r\n\r\nAnd it wouldn't sync again after this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEdits and new photos should sync with iCloud Photo Library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStatus stayed stuck in 'uploading' for days, and the edits and new photos never propagated to additional devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
