    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached code sample reproduces a crash we are seeing in the Alamofire project in the optimized Swift 2.0 build. We are not seeing this issue in the same logic when built against Swift 1.2. The provided code sample compiles fine in Debug, but crashes the compiler in Release. There is also a provided workaround that we have found to temporarily get around the issue. \r\n\r\nAny help you could provide to fix the issue would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to compile the app in Release...it will crash the compiler.\r\nComment out the offending line and uncomment our temporary workaround...code will compile in release.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SecuritySwiftCrash.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/cnoon/Radar-Swift-2.0-Security-Framework"
