    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen going for a workout (walking outside) I don't see any current heat rat.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go into the fitness app\r\n2. start a workout - Walking Outside\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- On the heart rate page there should be a current heart rate be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- no information is shown on the heart rate page\r\n- there are just two dashes and text suggesting that it is measuring\r\n- see attached screen shot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0 (13S5293f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEven though there is no display of the heart rate, the green light for the sensor is active. Also, later, I can see recorded heart rate values in the health app. Therefore the bug probably is in the fitness app."
