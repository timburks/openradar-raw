        Summary:
        The Xcode 7 Beta 4 Release notes state the following known issue:

        “Code Coverage
        • Xcode does not show code coverage information for source files in static libraries.
        Workaround: Add the source files directly to application or framework targets. (15605406)”

        I have code and tests within frameworks, and their code coverage is not properly reported in the Report Navigator tab. When viewing the code coverage results in the actual source files, I can verify nearly the entire source file is covered, but in the Report Navigator it shows up as zero percent.

        The workaround listed in the release notes does not appear to be accurate, and I currently do not get accurate coverage results for my framework targets.
