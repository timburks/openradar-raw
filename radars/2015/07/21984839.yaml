        Summary:
        iCloud shared photo albums shouldn’t be different from regular photo albums. I should be able to share an existing one rather than need to create a new separate “shared” one, which is limited in ways that regular photo albums aren’t such as not being able to be put in a folder, and have their own ordering separate from how non-shared albums are ordered.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to share an existing Photos.app album.

        Expected Results:
        I should be able to simply share an existing album with someone else without having to create a new “shared” album.

        Actual Results:
        Need to create a new, separate “shared” album.
