        Summary:
        When I installed 10.11 beta 1, beta 2, and now beta 3, initial connections from Remote Desktop all drew the login window offscreen. I couldn’t see the user selection UI or the password field, and had to guess about how to fill them in with the keyboard. Screenshot attached.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Update to any El Capitan seed yet released, on what is in this case a headless Mac Mini
        2. Connect with Remote Desktop

        Expected Results:
        I expect to see the remote machine’s login window fill my Remote Desktop window.

        Actual Results:
        The bottom half of the Remote Desktop window is black, and the top half of my window shows the bottom half of the login window, as seen in the attached screenshot.

        Regression:
        I have not observed this with any previous OS release. It does not appear to happen on reboot, or outside of the application of an OS update.

        Notes:
        Typing the first letter of my username to select it, then return, then the password, did log me in. (It then showed me the iCloud login demand in a scaled-down window, as seen here: http://bpxl.io/qOXq/4GGbwFoh. The window size didn’t normalize until after I got past the iCloud window, and the Finder/desktop appeared.)
