    description: "Resolution:\r\nMy mistake.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI had already implemented text input in notifications in my application in Xcode 7 beta 3. After updating to beta 4 the code no longer compiles and there is no alternative solution to accomplish the same task.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to call setBehavior: on an instance of UIMutableUserNotificationAction.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCode compiles.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCode will not compile because setBehavior: is not defined."
