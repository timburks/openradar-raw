    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a trivial, almost cosmetic bug.\r\n\r\nWhen selecting the Accessibility product in the bug reporting tool, one of the fields is titled \"OS X Version/Build\". However, iOS has lots of accessibility features too, so the title of this field should be \"OS X or iOS Version/Build\"."
