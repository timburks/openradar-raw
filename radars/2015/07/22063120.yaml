    description: "When using MPRemoteCommandCenter's likeCommand or bookmarkCommand in an app that also offers a \"rewind\" or \"seek back\" command, such as a podcast player, the \"seek back\" command is replaced in Control Center and the lock screen with a menu for the likeCommand or bookmarkCommand.\r\n\r\nThe new Apple Music app in iOS 9 easily fits its \"like\" button beside the \"seek back\" button, rather than replacing it.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nApps using MPRemoteCommandCenter's likeCommand should provide the same UI in Control Center and the lock screen that the new Music app offers, capable of showing both \"Like\" and \"seek back\" simultaneously.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nApps using MPRemoteCommandCenter's likeCommand do not display \"seek back\" anymore in Control Center and the lock screen, and, adding insult to injury, bury the \"Like\" command in a hamburger menu.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe Music app also offers a Share button in Control Center, which would be great to have a public API to enable as well."
