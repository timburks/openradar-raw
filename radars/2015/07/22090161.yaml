        Summary:
        Customizing the animation of the push-navigations of a UINavigationController by implementing the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning-delegate no longer works as in iOS 8.4.
        The animation still works as expected, but when the iPad gets rotated when the second VC is visible, and then popped back to the previous one, the size of the view is not getting updated.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Start the attached project on an iOS9-device / the simulator
        2. Tap the “Tap me”-button
        3. Rotate the device
        4. Tap on “< Back”
        5. One part of the screen should now be black, as the white-main-view didn’t get resized. There is an example-screenshot inside the project-folder.

        You can redo those steps on an iOS 8.3 device / simulator and should be able to see the difference.

        Expected Results:
        The size of the first VC should be correct after tapping the back-button.

        Actual Results:
        The view did not get resized.

        Regression:
        In at least iOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4 it works as expected.
