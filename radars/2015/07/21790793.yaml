    description: "Summary:\r\nSince recently I’ve started using the Dutch Siri in my car (CarPlay) and yesterday it suddenly decided to use my name.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately utterly failed to pronounce my name correct. As a matter of fact, it pronounced it in the single most annoying way I have encountered in my life and something I had hoped I had left behind me by now (assuming I’m French).\r\n\r\nMy name is Eloy, it’s hispanic:\r\n* the true pronunciation is like so: http://f.cl.ly/items/3P0F1v2v3G0O1s381H3x/Eloy%20Original%20Spanish%20Name%20Pronunciation.m4a\r\n* because I live in the Netherlands, though, an acceptable pronunciation is like so: http://f.cl.ly/items/1b2l0Q0K1T1c2X0V3g3e/Eloy%20Dutch%20Name%20Pronunciation.m4a\r\n* if you get to know my online pseudonym (alloy), you may even pronounce it like so: http://f.cl.ly/items/0B1B1A0C3r0K402V3F0S/Eloy%20English%20Name%20Pronunciation.m4a\r\n\r\nBut under no circumstance, ever, will I accept the incorrect French pronunciation: http://f.cl.ly/items/2r2M0y3U1V0r1x3c1j1c/Eloy%20Incorrect%20French%20Pronunciation.m4a\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the willingness to make the experience more personal, you can simply not make any assumptions about names. When you do and you fail, you have made that error personal.\r\n\r\nPlease fix my name. Or, even better, remove it completely to ensure that nobody gets insulted anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change Siri to Dutch (it might occur with English Siri too, I did not try.)\r\n2. Have Siri pronounce the name ‘Eloy’.\r\n3. Cringe.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither one of the 3 accepted ways to pronounce my name or no name calling at all.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri thinks my name is French."
