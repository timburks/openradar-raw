    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the two days since I installed watchOS 2.0 beta 4 on my Apple Watch, I have repeatedly (up to 3 or 4 times a day) come to use it and found it totally unresponsive to user input, as if turned off. Only I'm not able to turn it on and have to force a reboot by holding down both the button and digital crown.\r\n\r\nThe battery in each case was NOT exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe watch worked fine until I installed beta 4 and the problems started within an hour or so of the upgrade.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install watch OS 2.0 beta 4\r\n2. Leave watch idle\r\n3. Come to use it and find it totally unresponsive\r\n4. Force reboot with button & digital crown\r\n5. Check battery level and observe battery was NOT exhausted\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the watch to remain responsive at all times while it has remaining battery power.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUn-responsive watch.\r\n\r\nWhen the watch is unresponsive, if I plug my iPhone into my Mac and check in the Xcode >> Devices window, it does not show up as paired to my iPhone, like it does when it's working normally.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0 beta 4 (13S5305d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm not going to get much app development done with a watch behaving like this.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Sport 38mm aluminum\r\nPaired with iPhone 5 running iOS 9 beta 4 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
