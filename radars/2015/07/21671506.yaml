    description: "Summary:\r\nSearching for a simple query on Mail.app can easily take 60+ seconds for even the most simple queries. This shortcoming is the only reason I still have a copy of the Gmail app on my iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail.app.\r\n2. Search for a query (e.g., “reservation”).\r\n3. Wait (often takes more time than I’m patient enough to endure and I quit the app, but 60+s is typical).\r\n4. See results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStep 3 should take only a couple of seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStep 3 takes so long that I want to give up."
