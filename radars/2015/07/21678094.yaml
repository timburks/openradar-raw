    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm assuming this is not a bug, but every time I go to download a podcast in the new Podcasts app in the iOS 9 beta, (by tapping the ellipsis next to the non downloaded podcast) the menu item to download the episode says \"Resume Download\" even though the podcast is not in the download queue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch podcasts and locate a undownloaded podcast\r\n2. Tap the ellipsis next to it to bring up the menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the podcast is not in the download queue, the menu item should say \"Download\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEven if the podcast has never started downloading, the menu reads \"Resume Download\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI considered reporting this under UI/Usability, but something tells me this is an design oversight as opposed to an actual glitch. If it is in fact unintended behavior, feel free to reclassify it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 64 GB"
