        Summary:
        A user of an app is able to write and submit an App Store review from public betas of iOS and OS X. This rarely results in meaningful information, as the behavior of the OS is subject to change until the final version, and as the app may be updated between the beta phase and the final release to accommodate API changes. More often than not, it makes for complaints of instability, performance issues, and other problems, which is non-constructive feedback.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install an app on a public beta version of iOS or OS X.
        2. Hop over to the App Store.
        3. Write a review about the app, complaining about, say, stability, etc.
        4. Submit it.

        Expected Results:
        It should not be possible to submit the review.

        Actual Results:
        The review can be submitted, giving the developer no helpful feedback (as they may already be working to adjust their app to the new OS version, and as the OS behavior itself is likely to be in flux until the final release), and giving other users a false impression of poor quality.
