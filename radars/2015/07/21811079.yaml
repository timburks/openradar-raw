    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Photos, containers only have a parent property, but no children property. It is possible to fetch all top level album objects, but it is not possible to traverse the tree and discover the child albums.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a hierarchy of albums in Photos, with one album named \"Top\" at the top level and \"Child\" in a folder\r\n2. Run this script into Script Editor:\r\ntell application \"Photos\"\r\n\tname of containers\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScript Editor shows this result:\r\n{\"Top\", \"Child\"}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScript Editor shows this result:\r\n{\"Top\"}\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue always occurs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are no workarounds. The best solution would be if containers would get a new \"children\" property that allowed traversal. As it is, our users are locked out from the majority of their albums - if you take into account that all iPhoto events are imported in a folder called \"iPhoto events\"."
