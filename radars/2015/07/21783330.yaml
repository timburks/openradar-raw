        Summary:
        The CoreGraphics Swift interfaces do not contain a definition for kCGNullWindowID, though the documentation mentions it numerous times.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Attempt to use the following code snippet:

                let windowList: NSArray! = CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(CGWindowListOption.OptionOnScreenOnly, kCGNullWindowID)

        Build in Xcode (tested using Version 7.0 beta (7A121l)).

        Please see attached Xcode project which demonstrates the issue.

        Expected Results:
        There are two possible expectations:
        - kCGNullWindowID should be defined, since the documentation mentions it several times. When defined, compilation of the mentioned line should succeed.
        - A proper value for Swift should be defined, and the documentation should be updated to reflect this definition, instead of calling out kCGNullWindowID.

        Actual Results:
        The swift compiler emits the following error when building: main.swift:12:101: error: use of unresolved identifier 'kCGNullWindowID'

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Using 0 in place of kCGNullWindowID seems to be a suitable workaround (since that’s how it was #defined in the C headers). However, that value isn’t properly documented. A proper value should be described in the documentation.
