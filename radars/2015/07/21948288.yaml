    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a watchOS 1 WatchKit Extension, and in it we call \r\n- presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions:allowedInputMode:completion: with suggestions set to nil and allowedInputMode set to plain (to take the user straight into dictation). Without any changes, we try to run our watchOS 1 extension (live on the App Store) on watchOS 2 Beta 4, and it just shows a black screen with a Cancel button (screenshot attached).\r\n\r\nOf note, Siri itself does work on the Watch. It just doesn't work in our app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch watchOS 1 extension (live on App Store) on a watchOS 2 Beta 4 device\r\n2. Try the functionality that calls presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions:allowedInputMode:completion: with suggestions set to nil and allowedInputMode set to plain\r\n3. You see a black screen with a Cancel button (screenshot attached)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri dictation should be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe see a black screen with a Cancel button. No Siri dictation. Not only is the UI missing, but when you talk, nothing happens\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2 Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Sport 42mm, on Wi-Fi"
