        Summary:
        The shake to undo gesture in Mail.app is not easily discoverable and, more often than not, is initiated unintentionally. It would be nice for there to be a more discoverable method to undo sending or archiving.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Mail.app.
        2. Archive a message.
        3. Shake your iPhone.
        4. Be surprised that you’re being asked to “Undo” when you had no intention of undoing anything.
        4.b Sometimes shaking does nothing.

        Expected Results:
        4. Shaking your phone should always do nothing. There should be another, more obvious and functional method to undo Mail operations.

        Actual Results:
        4. Shaking your phone displays UI to “Undo Archive”.
