        Summary:

        On OS X 10.10.x and later, disabling Gatekeeper does not mean it is permanently off. After a set amount of time (currently 30 days), Gatekeeper will automatically re-enable itself with the "Allow apps downloaded from: Mac App Store and identified developers" setting.

        After doing some research, it looks like Gatekeeperâ€™s automatic re-enablement function can be disabled by running the following command with root privileges:

        defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security GKAutoRearm -bool false

        This would allow Gatekeeper to be set to "Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere" and have it stay that way.

        However, it does not appear that I can manage this with a profile based on the CFPreferencesCopyValue variable being used.

        https://github.com/aosm/security_systemkeychain/blob/master/syspolicyd/syspolicyd.cpp#L298

        Instead, it looks like CFPreferencesCopyAppValue would need to be used. (see attached screenshot).

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Install profile
        2. Check value for com.apple.security GKAutoRearm

        Expected Results:

        com.apple.security GKAutoRearm is set to False

        Actual Results:

        com.apple.security GKAutoRearm is set to True

        Regression:

        Running the defaults command listed above sets the following value:

        GKAutoRearm is set to False
