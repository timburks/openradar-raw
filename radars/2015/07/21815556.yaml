        Summary:
        Apple Developer accounts that belong in multiple teams (e.g. in a personal dev account and one for their work team) can no longer validate builds in Xcode. This used to work before, but around the time that App Analytics were released (or slightly before), this stopped working.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) In Xcode Organizer, select an archived build, and click Validate…
        2) Choose your team under the account which belongs to multiple teams.
        3) Continue to validate

        Expected Results:
        We should receive validation results for the archive.

        Actual Results:
        We receive an error that says ”iTunes Store operation failed. You are not authorized to use this service for provider: [team id]”

        Regression:
        This used to work in previous versions of Organizer, but stopped working around (or slightly before) App Analytics were released.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
