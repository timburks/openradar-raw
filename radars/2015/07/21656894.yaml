        Summary:
        Selecting “Share Playlist…” brings up a UIActivityViewController, but it doesn’t share anything that can be copied or emailed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add some playlists to your “Up Next…” queue
        2. Play the playlist from your “Up Next” queue
        3. On the Now Playing screen, tap the “…” option on the bottom-right corner of the screen.
        4. Select “Share Playlist…”

        Expected Results:
        I expected to share the playlist that had contained this song.

        Actual Results:
        The UIActivityViewController is presented, but it doesn’t actually contain an activity item that can be shared.
