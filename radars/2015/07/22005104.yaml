    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes when playing with Xcode 7 beta and back to Xcode 6.4 for doing production things I see there is a lot of the same simulator (have udid next to simulator model). I noticed also that every simulator is the same. It has the same system version (8.4). I think it should not be duplicated and there should be one iPhone 6 (8.4) instead of 14.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play with different betas and use simulators\r\n2. Back to Xcode 6.4\r\n3. Expand simulators list\r\n4. See there is a lot of simulators.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be just one simulator of the same model per system version.\r\n\r\niPhone 5 (8.0), iPhone 5(8.4), iPhone 5 (9.0), etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA lot of simulators pointing to the same one\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4, Xcode 7 beta 2, Xcode 7 beta 3, Xcode 7 beta 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-07-27 at 07.34.20.png' was successfully uploaded."
