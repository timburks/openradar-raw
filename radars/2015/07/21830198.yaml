    description: "Summary:\r\nLaunching app from SpringBoard has noticeable delay.\r\n\r\nAfter tapping of an app icon is done, app-launching animation should immediately start. Instead, the device waits for the icon to be overlaid with grey rounded-rectangle first, then the grey transparent overlay fades out and app launches.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the app launching experience feels far less responsive.\r\n\r\nThis lag seem very likely to be introduced alongside with a workaround of detecting short tap, press or long-press in Force Touch API.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap any icon on home screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter finger is lifted, app immediately starts launching.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter finger is lifted, the device waits for the icon to be overlaid with grey rounded-rectangle first, then the grey transparent overlay fades out and app launches.\r\n\r\nThe app launching experience feels far less responsive.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 Beta 3 (13A4293f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device running iOS 9 beta 3 (13A4293f)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
