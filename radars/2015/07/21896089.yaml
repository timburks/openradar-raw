        Summary:

        Occasionally I open a system header and accidentally modify it by typing before realising which file I'm in. Sometimes I then run or do something else which causes the header file to be saved.

        Once this happens, Xcode reports problems with precompiled headers being out of date.

        Really, the headers in the SDK folders shipped with Xcode should be locked. There's no typical reason to edit them, and we should be protected against doing it by accident.

        An alternative would be to have Xcode detect this situation and warn the user that they were about to modify a system header.
