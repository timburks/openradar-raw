    description: "Summary:\nWe would like to have an additional API in the AVPictureInPictureController that adds the functionality to show a custom layer which could embed any content, in our use case a CAEAGLLayer to render a video.\n\nVLC for iOS supports a wide range of custom video codecs and streaming protocols which requires rendering in a custom layer for formats unsupported by the included vDSP.\n\nThis will be very interesting for video conference apps or further professional productivity apps that don’t / can’t rely on AVKit for displaying video content. Further usage scenarios coming to mind would be educational setups or video surveillance products, which often depend both on rarely used protocols and codecs as well as SAT>IP applications supporting the legacy MPEG-2-video codec mandated by DVB standards. \n\nWe are aware of the potential for misuse that this might introduce and thought It could be combined with a new capability or entitlement that flags our App as wanting to use this feature for displaying custom video content. This can be used to flag Apps using this feature for extra review ensuring the API is not misused.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nN/A\n\nExpected Results:\nN/A\n\nActual Results:\nN/A\n\nRegression:\nN/A\n\nNotes:\nN/A"
