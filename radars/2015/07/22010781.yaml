        App Analytics are only supported for iOS apps, and not available on the Mac. iOS app developers got a great tool that helps them make better apps and sell more of them. It would be very useful if Mac developers got the same treatment.

        Notes: This stuff is important. Good tools make development easier. Easier development leads to better quality apps. And better quality app ecosystem leads to more Macs sold. Hey!
