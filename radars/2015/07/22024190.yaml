    description: "Summary:\r\nThe built in camera app records the location in the photos, i assume because EXIF data has a place for it, and because location is available with an iOS device.\r\n\r\nBut Core Motion is also available, and barring LIDAR or some other distance-computing hardware, having the Euler angles and compass direction -- basically everything that a CMCoreMotion object contains -- would allow developers to do extraordinary things, even beyond distance-estimates\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCoreMotion should be stored and surfaced in Photos Kit\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly location data is stored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.x, iOS 9 betas\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
