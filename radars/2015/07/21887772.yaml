    description: "Summary:\r\nAn image asset configured in Asset Catalog to be \"sliced\" horizontally and vertically, with tiled center as large as the image itself, is being encoded as a non-resizable image. As a result, in an iOS app a large image view will stretch that image, not tile it. This happens when running the built app on either iOS 9 or iOS 8 – though notice that image is displayed correctly tiled when used in Interface Builder.\r\nWhen building the same app in Xcode 6E35b (6.4 GM), image is displayed correctly when running on iOS 8, however when running on iOS 9, it becomes stretched in a completely different, unexpected way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project with a single view controller.\r\n2. Put a small square image into the asset catalog – with @1, @2 and @3 versions.\r\n3. Configure each resolution version of that image like this:\r\n    – Slices: Horizontally and Vertically;\r\n    – Caps: 0, 0, 0, 0;\r\n    – Center: Tiles\r\n    – Width: (image width), Height: (image height).\r\n4. Put an image view into the storyboard scene. Configure it with the newly added image. Notice how Interface Builder correctly tiles the image.\r\n5. Run the app on either iOS 8 or iOS 9.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image is expected to be tiled across the image view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage is stretched.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7A152u, running OS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround is to explicitly configure the image to be resizable with zero insets and tiled resizing mode.\r\nI should note again that when building this using Xcode 6.4 and running iOS 9, the situation becomes even worse and the workaround doesn't even help!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs if building with Xcode 7A152u, but not if building with Xcode 6.4 and earlier. Doesn't occur if the image uses a non-zero resizing insets."
