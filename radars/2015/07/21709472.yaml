        Summary: QuickTime Player is fantastic for displaying an iOS device on your screen, with the intended use for making a video of you using an iOS device, for App Previews for example. However, it’s also a lot more reliable an better quality than using something like Reflector or AirServer. The only limitation - I can’t show off two different devices on my screen at the same time. This is a feature request to allow that.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Capture Screen Recordings with QuickTime Player
        1. Connect the first iOS device to your Mac using a Lightning cable.
        2. Connect the second iOS device to your Mac with another Lightning cable
        3. Open QuickTime Player.
        4. Choose File > New Movie Recording.
        5. In the window that appears, both iOS Devices are listed  as the Camera and Microphone input source. Select the first device.
        6. Attempt to go to File > New Movie Recording.

        Expected Results:

        I’d like to be able to make a second movie recording of the second device at the same time.

        Actual Results:

        The New Movie Recording is greyed out.

        Notes:

        Even better - don’t make it so that I have to do a video recording. Just mirroring the displays on my Mac screen is all that I want so that I can display them on a WebEx call. In that case, they shouldn’t have the little record bar show up when I hover my mouse over the iOS screen window.
