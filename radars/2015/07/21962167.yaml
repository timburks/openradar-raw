    description: Currently, the CloudKit framework does not provide a means of checking the number of CKRecords in a database that match a specific CKQuery. Developers are forced to contrive a workaround to obtain this information, such as incrementing an integer on another record any time a new record is created. These types of workarounds are error-prone.
