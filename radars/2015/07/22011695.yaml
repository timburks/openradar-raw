    description: "I have large hands and the tiny little buttons that move on the app launch screen are very hard to hit. I have found that launching apps via Siri (saying “Open Activity”) or glances is a workaround.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Siri is unavailable during many of my workouts (where I don’t carry my iPhone.) And using a glance as a workaround is not an option.\r\n\r\nStarting a workout is a daily frustration for me.\r\n\r\nOf course, a better solution would be to fix the terrible usability of the app launch screen. Larger buttons that don’t move (like on the iPhone) would be a very welcome addition. Hide the option under accessibility if you want to keep the current solution as a sexy, but intractable, interface."
