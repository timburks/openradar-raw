    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I have a free book sample, and I tap to buy the full book, but then cancel, the free sample is deleted, and I have to hunt the store again for the book.\r\n\r\nI have seen three scenarios where this can happen: tapping Cancel on the iTunes Store password prompt, network going down after tapping Buy, or not accepting a change in the terms and conditions of the store service (this last case is how I discovered the bug). It might also happen if the iTunes account doesn't have a valid payment method, but I have not tested this scenario.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCancelling password prompt:\r\n1. Open iBooks and go to the book store.\r\n2. Select any book.\r\n3. Tap \"Sample\" to download the book sample.\r\n4. Return to the library.\r\n5. Open the book sample.\r\n6. Tap to buy the full book. The book is automatically closed and the screen goes back to the library. The book sample is grayed out and a progress bar appears on it. The \"Sign In to iTunes Store\" prompt appears.\r\n7a. Tap Cancel on the password prompt. In some cases I have seen the password prompt appear again up to three times (separate bug?); in that case keep tapping Cancel until it goes away.\r\n8a. The book sample disappears from the library.\r\n\r\nNetwork failure:\r\n1-6. Same steps as above.\r\n7b. After the \"Sign in to iTunes Store\" prompt appears, make the network go down. Control Center is not accessible while the password prompt is visible, but it's still possible to enter airplane mode via Siri. Or you can just unplug your Wi-Fi router.\r\n8b. Enter your iTunes password and tap OK.\r\n9b. An alert appears saying there was an error connecting to the iTunes store. Dismiss it.\r\n10b. The book sample disappears from the library.\r\n\r\nT&C changes:\r\nThis case needs an iTunes account that hasn't been used for purchases since June 30, 2015, so it's harder to test:\r\n1-6. Same steps as above.\r\n7c. On the iTunes Store password prompt, enter the password as normal and tap OK.\r\n8c. A new prompt appears saying \"iTunes Terms & Conditions have changed\". Tap Cancel.\r\n9c. The book sample disappears from the library.\r\n\r\nA fourth scenario where this might happen is if the account doesn't have a valid payment method, but I have not tested this, so it's speculation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the purchase to be cancelled, but the free book sample should remain in my library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe book sample is deleted from the library. I have to search for the book in the store again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niBooks 3.2 (2083) on iOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI could also reproduce the \"cancel password prompt\" scenario on an iPhone 5s with iOS 8.4 (built-in iBooks). I didn't test the other cases, but I suspect they'd be reproducible as well.\r\n\r\nI think Apple should fix both the App Store version of iBooks for iOS 7 and the built-in version for iOS 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation, 32GB, A1421, MD720E/A"
