    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen providing the name of a code signing identity to use to codesign with there is no option or flag to ignore expired certificates. For example, I had an expired certificate with the same name as the renewed certificate and code signing throws an error because it finds two certificates with the same name. If the ignore expired option existed this command would complete as it would just use the new identity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave two identities in the keychain with the same name but have one expired. Attempt to coding with a command such as \r\n\r\ncodesign  -f -s \"iPhone Distribution: 3 Sided Cube Design Ltd (25H7BM6YWK)\" --entitlements /Users/matthewcheetham/Desktop/Payload/ARC\\ Flood.app/archived-expanded-entitlements.xcent /Users/matthewcheetham/Desktop/Payload/ARC\\ Flood.app/ARC\\ Flood \r\n\r\nSee the error; \r\n\r\n Distribution: 3 Sided Cube Design Ltd: ambiguous (matches \"iPhone Distribution: 3 Sided Cube Design Ltd\" and \"iPhone Distribution: 3 Sided Cube Design Ltd\" in /Users/matthewcheetham/Library/Keychains/login.keychain)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCodesign should have a flag to ignore expired and succeed with signing. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCodesigning fails."
