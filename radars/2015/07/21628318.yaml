    description: "The \"gravity\" settings of a scene in a .sks file can't be changed to negative! If I do so, it goes back to 0. The irony is that I can't even set back the default Earth Gravity (-9,8).\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/s/oi6aksvawr3z590/Screenshot%202015-07-01%2010.38.29.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nAlso, BTW, to be completely correct that default gravity should be -9,81 (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth)"
