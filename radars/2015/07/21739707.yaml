        Summary:
        See the attached screenshot. All available updates are already being downloaded or installed, so the notification and the provided options don’t make sense any more.

        What would happen with the currently in progress updates if I click “Install”?
        What would happen with the currently in progress updates if I click “Later”?

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * get notification about new updates
        * run updates

        Expected Results:
        * notification dismissed as soon as the updates are in progress

        Actual Results:
        * notification only dismissed after all updates completed installing

        Regression:
