    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating from a Time Machine Backup to a new Mac with the Migration Assistent, empty directories are not recreated on the new Mac. This makes some applications (in particular PostgreSQL) which expect those directories to be present fail after the migration.\r\n\r\nThis corrupts the database if could lead to dataloss if the user doesn’t recognize they have to restore those empty directories to fix the database. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Install postgres sql via homebrew https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew\r\n* create database as instructed in /usr/local/var/postgres\r\n* observer postgresql server starting up correctly\r\n* create Time Machine Backup of the Mac\r\n* restore Time Machine Backup to a new Mac with Migration Assistant\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* Database server starting up successfully after migration\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* Database server not starting because auf missing directories, which were on the old Mac but aren’t created when restoring the backup\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\ndon’t now\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMany others are running into that issue, including when upgrading from another OSX Version to Yosemite.\r\nE.g http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25970132/pg-tblspc-missing-after-installation-of-os-x-yosemite"
