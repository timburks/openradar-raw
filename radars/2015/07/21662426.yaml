    description: "Summary:\r\nOnce a SpriteKit scene file has a relatively small number of empty nodes in it (15 or so) Xcode starts to bog down pretty heavily and max out 1 CPU on the system, even when sitting idle.\r\n\r\nClosing and re-opening the project helps a bit, but as soon as you edit the file it starts happening again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new SpriteKit OS X project.\r\n2. Open the default scene file.\r\n3. Start adding empty nodes to it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should be responsive, not maxing out a CPU.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode becomes sluggish, editing the scene file is slow, even typing in a node's fields can become very slow.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.4 (6E35b)\r\n\r\nOS X Version 10.10.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached project (SpriteKitSlowdown.zip) shows the behavior. GameScene.sks has a single SKSpriteNode and 29 empty SKNodes in the scene.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm using a MacBook Pro (13-Inch, Late 2011), 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5 with 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 RAM, using a 3rd party SSD (Samsung 840 EVO).\r\n\r\nGPU is an Intel HD Graphics 3000, currently plugged into a 1920x1080 monitor, though I see the same behavior when using the built-in display."
