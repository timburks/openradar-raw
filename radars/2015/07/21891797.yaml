    description: "Summary:\nWhen upgrading OS X from 10.10 to 10.11 ownership of /usr/local is reset to root:wheel, which breaks the homebrew installation for example.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n* on 10.10 install homebrew (http://brew.sh)\n* notice owner of /usr/local is changed to your  user\n* upgrade to 10.11\n\nExpected Results:\nowner of /usr/local unchanged\n\nActual Results:\nowner of /usr/local changed to root:wheel\n`brew update` fails, `brew doctor` complains about permissions on /usr/local \n\nRegression:\nNot 100% sure, but I think this was already when upgrading from 10.9 to 10.10\n\nNotes:\nSeems unrelated to the “rootless” feature in 10.11, as it is possible to change ownership back to the user with sudo.\n\nSee also https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/41665"
