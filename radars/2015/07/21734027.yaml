        Summary:
        After restoring to iOS 9 beta 3 from 8.4 the Apple Watch becomes unpaired. After pairing the watch, when setting up Activity on the watch, Activity on the iPhone for the past 48 hours no longer counts the existing data and Activity on the Watch starts from 0. The missing data still appears in Health on the iPhone but is not counted by the Activity app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Restore iPhone to iOS 9 beta 3.
        2) Pair Watch after restore completes.
        3) On Watch set up Activity.

        Expected Results:
        Activity on both the iPhone and Watch look for existing data in Health and adjust based on that data to bring Activity back to where it was before the iPhone restore and Watch pairing.

        Actual Results:
        Activity on the iPhone resets data to 0 for the current and previous day. Activity on the Watch starts at 0.

        Notes:
        iPhone 6 Plus (64GB) on iOS 9 Beta 3 with Apple Watch on watchOS 1.0.1
