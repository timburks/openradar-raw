        Summary:
        Starting in iOS 9b4, a UIAlertController is presented when an app tries to open another app with openURL:. This is confusing and disrupting to users when an app is trying to open URLs to itself, which must be done to authenticate in the OAuth authentication scheme. These URLs are in CFBundleURLTypes in Info.plist and should bypass this alert.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Register myapp as a URL scheme in Info.plist CFBundleURLTypes
        2. [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"myapp://"]];

        Expected Results:
        AppDelegate's URL handling method is run.

        Actual Results:
        UIAlertController from system is displayed saying "MyApp wants to open MyApp."

        Regression:
        Regression since iOS 9b3.

        Notes:
        This can be seen when performing OAuth steps. If OAuth was performed in a UIWebView before, the alert displayed might say "MyApp wants to open MyApp." Now, with SFSafariViewController, it's "SafariViewService wants to open MyApp."
