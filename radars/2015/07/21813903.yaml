        Summary:
        When using bots, Iâ€™ve noticed that when first viewing the available logs in the dropdown, the After Trigger log is not available. If I click on a previous integration, then go back to the latest integration and check the available logs in the dropdown again, I get the After Trigger log but not the before trigger log. If I repeat that process a few more times, I end up with both in the list.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Click on the latest integration that has both before and after trigger scripts/logs
        2) Click the logs tab
        3) Click the Show dropdown, and see that you can see the Before Trigger log, but not the after Trigger log.
        4) Click an older integration.
        5) Repeat steps 2 and 3, but notice you only see the After Trigger log.
