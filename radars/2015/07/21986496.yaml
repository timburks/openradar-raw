    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Battery Usage screen in iOS 8 is fantastic, however it shows % of battery usage over 24 hours or 7 days, but does not indicate the amount of foreground/background time over which this battery usage was spread over.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse a high-battery consumption app for a *short* period of time and note the percentage of battery used over the past 24 hours in Settings > General > Usage > Battery Usage.\r\n\r\nIf the app is visible in as a significant user of battery, it is the user responsibility to have a mental note of how *long* they used the app in order to determine if the app is a bad citizen or if the app is reasonably efficient.\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot [provided to Apple] I believe that I only used Hangouts for ~5 minutes in the past 24 hours, yet it has consumed 9% of my battery. Was it running in the background for a long period of time (draining my battery) or was it highly inefficient during those 5 foreground minutes of use?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Usage should show the Battery Usage as a percentage, but it should also include the Foreground and Background time the app was running and optimally a calculation of *app efficiency* so that apps that are not good citizens of the platform can easily be identified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Battery Usages shows the amount of battery used over a given time period, but the amount of time the app was running in the foreground/background is *not* visible, this it is hard to distinguish between apps that are used frequently vs apps that are highly inefficient.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
