    description: "Summary:\r\nAlbum artwork changes do not save permanently for music stored in iCloud such as songs matched using iTunes Match/Apple Music or songs purchased via the iTunes Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a music album to library with iTunes Match/Apple Music enabled.\r\n2. Once the album has been marked as Matched/Apple Music, attempt to change the album artwork.\r\n2a. Select album\r\n2b. Get info on selected album\r\n2c. Drag new album artwork image onto artwork well\r\n3. The system will appear to change the artwork but after some time (usually after an iCloud Music Library update) the artwork will be reverted back to what was originally set at the time the album was added to the library or to something entirely incorrect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should be able to change album artwork on any tracks in the library, regardless if they are stored locally or in iCloud. Artwork should be applied permanently to cloud-artwork-info file store in iCloud until changed again by the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlbum artwork does initially get uploaded and cloud-artwork-info file updated when replaced via iTunes but eventually the cloud-artwork-info file reverts to some earlier state and causes the older artwork to be downloaded on to the local iTunes artwork storage. This has been an issue since iTunes Match (now iCloud Music Library) launched about 4.5 years ago.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes: 12.2.1"
