    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a modally-presented UIViewController accesses its presentationController -- just to log it, just to inspect the class, etc. -- it will never be deallocated when dismissed.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample project which reproduces it with very minimal code. There are two defines:\r\n1. Log the controller after dismiss (using a weak ptr and a timer)\r\n2. Log the presentation controller after the view appears.\r\n\r\nThe only required one to reproduce is the latter. I've reproduced this under iOS 9 as well as iOS 8, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Access a UIViewController's presentationController\r\n2. Watch the lifecycle of the UIViewController from that point forward.\r\n3. Note the UIViewController never deallocates again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIViewController is not overretained by calling .presentationController.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIViewController is overretained by calling .presentationController.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.0 beta 3 (7a152u) & Xcode 6.4 (6e35b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator - iOS 9 and iOS 8.3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PresentedControllerOverretain.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nSample code: https://bitbucket.org/zacwest/presentedcontrolleroverretain"
