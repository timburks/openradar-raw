        Summary:
        The —import-strings-file described in ibtool’s man page does not return any error but does not work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        I attached a few files:

        - A storyboard and xib each containing a single label with the text “Computer”
        - A strings file for each of them previously exported with —export-strings-file but with the “Computer” text modified to “Ordinateur” - computer in french :)
        - A script that calls ibtool with —import-strings-file with storyboard and with the xib

        Expected Results:
        I expect the storyboard and xib to have their label’s text replaced with “Ordinateur”.

        Actual Results:
        ibtool with —import-strings-file does not report any error but the storyboard and xib files are not modified.

        Regression:
        Reproduced in Xcode 6’s ibtool.
