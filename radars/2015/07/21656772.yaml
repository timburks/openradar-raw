        Summary:
        “Add to Up Next…” never works the way I expect it to work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Begin playing an album from either Apple Music search results or your music library.
        2. Select another album and add it to the “Up Next…” list.

        Expected Results:
        The second album will be added after the currently playing album.

        Actual Results:
        The second album will be added in full, immediately after the song that was playing, in the middle of the album that was playing. Unless the first album was played by adding it to an empty “Up Next” queue, in which case the second album will be added after the currently playing album.
