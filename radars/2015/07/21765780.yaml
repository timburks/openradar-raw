    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are two factory methods in the UIImage class interface in the iOS 9.0 Beta 3 SDK where the return type is nonnull UIImage *, but the API reference says that nil can be returned. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n * +imageWithCGImage:\r\n * +imageWithCGImage:scale:orientation:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse ‚å•-click to display the reference information for the identified methods.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy assumption is that the API reference is correct and that these methods should be updated to indicate that a nullable UIImage * is returned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf I pass in a NULL CGImageRef to either of the two factory methods, the result is nil. I do not know what other circumstances will cause nil to be returned."
