        Summary:
        When playing Apple Music on my Macbook, I want to be able to handoff to my phone before I leave so I can continue my jam in the same place I left off. Perhaps without missing a beat.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Play an Apple Music song in iTunes on Macbook
        2. Decide you need to leave to get some coffee
        3. Pick up your phone

        Expected Results:
        4. The ability to handoff the playing song to my phone

        Actual Results:
        4. Nothing. I have to stop the music on my laptop, and manually start it on my phone.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        The reverse is true as well. I would love to switch from my phone to my laptop when I sit down at my desk.
