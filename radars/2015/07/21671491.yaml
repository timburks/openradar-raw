        Summary:
        The App Store’s top charts do nothing but provide a way for app developers to manipulate a system. Paid downloads can easily shoot an app to the top of the chart, and it’s been shown that in some categories, all it takes to get within the top spots is 10+ downloads. This isn’t helpful for developers and provides a mechanism by which all it takes is a couple dollars in ad spend to get to the top.

        The top charts should be removed and more focus should be given to curation. This would improve discoverability for quality apps and remove the ability to “game the system” that’s in place now.

        See the Apple Music app for more examples on how the presence of Top Charts isn’t needed to promote good content.
