        Xcode was in the background doing nothing when it suddenly popped.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Can’t reproduce, but I think this is what happend:
        * connect a locked iOS Device to a Mac
        * keep Xcode running in the background
        * wait

        Expected Results:
        no crash

        Actual Results:
        Crash after a while

        Regression:
        Haven’t seen this crash with older Xcode versions

        Notes:
        The iOS device was connected for a while already before it crashed
