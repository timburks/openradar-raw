        With the introduction of bitcode and the future possibility of our apps being recompiled by iTunes or the App Store, this means that the binary running on our users’ devices could eventually differ from what was uploaded to iTunes Connect. Crash reports from these recompiled builds will not match the dSYM from the original submission which means our crash reports will get out of sync.

        I imagine Apple is working on a way for Xcode’s crash reporting functionality to transparently download these updated dSYM files, my concern is for those of us that use 3rd party crash reporting services. These services will not be of much help without the exact dSYM file for the build which is live in our user’s hands (or wrists).

        Please consider:
        - Having Xcode automatically download dSYM files from recompiled apps
        - Emailing the technical contacts when the App Store recompiles our app
        - Provide a link to download the new dSYM files
        - Provide a web hook for 3rd party crash reporting services to use for automatically downloading new dSYM files when they are made available
