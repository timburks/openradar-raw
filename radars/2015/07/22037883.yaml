    description: "Summary:\r\nThe callback function passed into SCNetworkReachabilitySetCallback() is called when the callback is first registered with SCNetworkReachability, even if no change has taken place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project, EachAbility, which is based on the Reachability sample project.\r\n2. Build and run it on a simulator or device with Internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe following message is logged to the console:\r\n\r\nInitially reachable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 8.4, the following message is logged to the console:\r\n\r\nInitially reachable\r\n\r\nOn iOS 9 beta 4, however, the following messages are logged to the console:\r\n\r\nInitially reachable\r\nNow reachable\r\n\r\nThe second log message is not expected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 13A4305g in both Simulator and on the device\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlenty of applications use some variation of Reachability and respond to network changes by, for instance, retrying network requests that failed or were deferred while offline. The extra call to the callback may cause unnecessary data usage in these applications, or bugs caused by an assumption that this callback is only called when the addressâ€™ reachability actually changes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator 9.0 (SimulatorApp-612 CoreSimulator-171) simulating iPhone 6, plus a real iPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'EachAbility.zip' was successfully uploaded."
