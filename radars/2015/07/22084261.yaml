    description: "Summary:\r\nwatchOS 2 NSURLSession requests are 10x-50x slower than iOS. \r\n\r\nI have an app that makes local network requests. With both the iPhone app and WatchKit 1 app extension these requests were very quick, completing the NSURLSession dataTaskWithRequest:completionHandler: block in under a half a second. On watchOS 2, it's between 10x-50x slower when fetching JSON.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached sample project \"FooProject\"\r\n2. Build and run iOS target\r\n3. Press the button to make network request\r\n4. Note the times displayed on screen and in the console\r\n5. Build and run watchOS target\r\n6. Press the button to make network request\r\n7. Note the times displayed on screen and in the console\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSURLSession network calls on watchOS can be slower than on iOS, but should not 10x-50x slower when fetching JSON.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwatchOS NSURLSession is extremely slow compared to iOS, in both the simulator and actual device.\r\n\r\nActual iOS device, 3 separate runs:\r\n\r\nRequest time: 0.052136 seconds\r\nRequest time: 0.321204 seconds\r\nRequest time: 0.044031 seconds\r\n\r\nActual watchOS watch (exact same code, exact same request):\r\n\r\nRequest time: 3.554821 seconds\r\nRequest time: 2.775169 seconds\r\nRequest time: 2.781989 seconds\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatchOS 2.0 (13S5305d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'FooProject.zip' was successfully uploaded."
