    description: "Summary:\nModifying characteristic values (birth date, blood type) in the Medical ID in Health.app does not affect the characteristic values you can access programmatically/in Health.app by going to the “Me” pane in Health.app. This creates confusion in apps that use the characteristic values.\n\n(User enters their blood type to the Medical ID, which is more visible than the Me pane, and opens up an app that accesses their blood type. App reports “no blood type”.) \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nEnter your blood type in the Medical ID.\nGo to the Health Data tab, tap on Me.\n\nExpected Results:\nMedical ID characteristic values should be in sync with the values in the Me pane.\n\nActual Results:\nBlood type in the Me pane does not reflect the Medical ID one.\n\nRegression:\nN/A\n\nNotes:\nN/A"
