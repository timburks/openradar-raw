    description: "Attachment (for Open Radar) https://www.dropbox.com/s/klu5t83nbtyqdeq/21888086.mov?dl=0\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Activity watch app rings displayed the caps animating round and round their tracks, but the rings remained at their start state. This was the first thing I saw in the morning, possibly the first thing the watch displayed that day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nView Activity rings first thing in the morning.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo animation, the rings are not filled when watch is first put on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCaps went spinning round and round, while rings remained in initial state. VERY STRANGE.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt may have been the Glance that did this, but I have Activity as a complication on my watch face and check it often. It may have been the App. Glance more likely, since it seemed to animate the caps for last night's state (spinning around.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nFirst thing seen that morning."
