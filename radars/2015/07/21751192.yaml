    description: "Summary:\r\nWith Passbook (still called Passbook as of this writing) as documented we use isPassLibraryAvailable to check if we can do anything with it, and make decisions on showing UI based on that, not device idiom. On iPad Air this returns YES, even though we can't do anything with the pass library, causing us  to show \"Add to Passbook\" button when it doesn't apply.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall isPassLibraryAvailable on iPad Air 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected return NO, or have app-and-user-accessible Passbook on iPad Air 2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReturns YES. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1., 8.4 Beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf isPassLibraryAvailable returns YES but can't add passes we will have to add checks based on UIDeviceIdiom which will make everybody sad. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2"
