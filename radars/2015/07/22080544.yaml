    description: "Summary:\r\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Viewing “My Music”, “Artists” view/group/sort\r\n2. Select “Compilations” from left source pane.\r\n3. Scroll through the compilation albums.\r\n\r\nObserve: \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlbum cells containing track listings are scrolled into view with consistent vertical spacing from each other.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhile first few albums are laid out fairly close to each other, eventually the albums become separated vertically by whitespace. It appears as though the cell sizing might be getting calculated from all the tracks laid out in one column, but then displayed in more than one. (Four columns in my fullscreen case, but observed with two columns in smaller window.)\r\n\r\nI have not observed this in any of the other selections (Recently Added, All Artists, individual artists), only Compilations."
