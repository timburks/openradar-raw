    description: "Summary:\r\nSlide Over multitasking in iOS 9 does not work with a keyboard inputAccessoryView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBring up the App Store as the main app, swipe in from the right and select an app that uses an inputAccessoryView.  When the virtual keyboard appears it goes across the entire bottom of the screen, but the inputAccessoryView originates at the left edge of the right split view instead of at the left edge of the keyboard.  If I change the frame of the inputAccessoryView to have a negative origin, the inputAccessoryView shifts to the left as expected, but it is clipped to the bounds of the right split view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe inputAccessoryView should go all the way across the top of the keyboard even though the secondary app is not full screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe inputAccessoryView starts at the wrong place and is cut off.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4293g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air, Verizon"
