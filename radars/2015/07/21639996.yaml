    description: "Summary:\r\nI was able to grab the username @PhilSchiller, when just playing around with the service on my first day and learning that I could have a user name that wasn't my name. I tried a few names quick and with like my third attempt, I was able to snag PhilSchiller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to personal Apple Music page settings, I did this in iTunes 12.2 on OS X.\r\n2. Change your user name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen choosing a name of an Apple executive, or notable celebrity, I should probably be told that this isn't possible for one reason or another.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am now @PhilSchiller.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.2, on OS X. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPhil should have my phone number, so feel free to have him contact me about getting his name back.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
