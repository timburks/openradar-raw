    description: "Summary:\nSpaces behaves incorrectly in 10.11b4 and b5. For example:\n\n* Spaces behaves as if “When switching to an application, Switch to a Space with open windows for the application” was on, even though it isn’t.\n* Two spaces: App A is active on Space 1, App B has an open window on Space 1 and Space 2. Switching from space 1 to space 2 will activate app B, and then incorrectly orders front the window for app B which is on *space 1*, forcing you back to Space A.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Disable “When switching to an application, Switch to a Space with open windows for the application”\n2. Open Safari. Open a window on Space 1, and another one on Space 2.\n3. Activate Finder by clicking on the desktop.\n4. Swipe right to go to space 2.\n\nExpected Results:\n5. The Safari window on Space 2 becomes key\n\nActual Results:\n5. The Safari window on Space 1 becomes key, and transports me back to Space 1.\n\nRegression:\nThis was introduced in beta 4. Beta 3 did not behave like this.\n\nNotes:\nHere is a video recording of this behavior: \nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6775/Spaces%20bug%2010.11b4-5.m4v"
