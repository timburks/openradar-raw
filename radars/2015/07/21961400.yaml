    description: "Summary:\r\nReplacing variables with those defined in build settings in a target’s info.plist is supported for most targets, but doesn’t work for command line targets which have an optional info.plist\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Create a new project using the “OS X > Application > Command Line Tool” template\r\n3. Verify that INFOPLIST_EXPAND_BUILD_SETTINGS (Expland Build Settings in Info.plist File) resolves to Yes\r\n4. Add an info.plist to your project with commonly substituted variables, such as ${PRODUCT_NAME} for CFBundleDisplayName\r\n5. Add the linker flags to include your info.plist in the built product: “-sectcreate __TEXT __info_plist Info.plist”\r\n6. Build the target\r\n7. Using the command line, verify the final info.plist: “otool -X -s __TEXT __info_plist -v /path/to/tool\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe info.plist content in step 7 would have the variables replaced\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe info.plist content in step 7 still contains the variable placeholders (${PRODUCT_NAME})"
