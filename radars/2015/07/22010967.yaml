        Summary:
        When quickly changing Safari’s bookmark storage in any way (most commonly, deleting multiple reading list items in quick succession), fairly often Safari will block the request to modify it and display an annoying alert (see screenshot)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - try to delete multiple reading list items in quick succession
        - alternatively, I think this sometimes reproduces when trying to delete a reading list item quickly after saving a bookmark or adding another item to the reading list

        Expected Results: Whatever I wanted to happened (remove an item from the reading list), happens.

        Actual Results: Sometimes, the request fails and a quick retry also fails. I have to wait a few seconds and only then Safari gives me a blessing to remove a reading list item…

        Regression: This also happened in iOS 8, and IIRC in previous versions as well
