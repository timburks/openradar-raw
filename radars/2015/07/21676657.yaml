    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an album or playlist is already playing, and some other music is added to Up Next, the newly added music is queued up before the rest of the music that was already playing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Music app, start playing an album by tapping the first song in the album (or by tapping Shuffle All)\r\n2. Navigate to another album, and tap Add to Up Next\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe second album should be added to Up Next, but queued to play _after_ the first album\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe second album is queued up to play next, with the first album queued after that"
