        Summary:
        The 'Open Project' button for the sample projects in the API documentation shows a confusing behaviour since Xcode7: when the button is clicked, another Open Project button appears. Also, opening the project should show some indication of activity while downloading the example project.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode
        2. Open Help > Documentation and API reference
        3. Search for a sample project like 'UICatalog'
        4. Click 'Open Project'

        Expected Results:
        - It should show some kind of activity indicator if the example project needs to be downloaded and then download and open the project.

        Actual Results:
        - Since Xcode 7, a second Button "Open Project" appears. Clicking this one downloads the project without any indication to the user that something is happening and after 10s-1min the project opens. This often leads to confusion with new Xcode users.
