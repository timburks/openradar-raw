    description: "The following function:\n\n    func testCorrectAnswer() {\n        let N = 8\n        let weight = 4\n        let oddWeight = 5\n        \n        for var n = 0; n < N; n++ {\n            var balls: [Ball] = []\n            for i in 0..<N {\n                balls.append(Ball(weight: weight, index: i))\n            }\n            balls[n] = Ball(weight: oddWeight, index: n)\n            \n            let found = findOddBallOutCorrectAnswer(balls)\n            let index = found?.index ?? -1\n            XCTAssertEqual(index, n)\n        }\n    }\n\nCauses the compiler to trap under release mode when building for test.\n\nSpecifically, it is the “XCTAssertEqual(index, n)” line that is causing the issue. \n\nI’ve attached the project."
