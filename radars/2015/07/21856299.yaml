        Summary:
        I recently helped my grandparents with the accessibility settings on their AppleTV. My grandmother sees, but can’t read the menus easily. I turned on Voice Over for her, which is great, except that she got confused, then annoyed at the “button 1 of 7”-type announcements after each item.

        It would be great if there could be a toggle for Voice Over that would allow it to _only_ read the text on screen, rather than describing the whole UI, which would make it more useful for people who can see the screen, just not in enough detail to read the text.
