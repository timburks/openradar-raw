        Summary:
        if app calls calls -[UIApplication openURL:] with URL scheme assigned to the app itself, AppDelegate should not go through applicationWillResignActive / applicationDidBecomeActive

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Please use attached project.
        Launch, click the button, observe log messages in console.

        Actual Results:
        Even though the URL is handled by the app itself, and it doesn’t become inactive, the app delegate receives both applicationWillResignActive & applicationDidBecomeActive callbacks.

        Expected Results:
        App delegate should not be notified about resigning active / returning to active state if URL is handled by the app itself.

        Notes:
        This behaviour violates app’s lifecycle, as it clearly doesn’t become active while URL is processed internally

        Mu current workaround includes setting a boolean flag inside of -[UIApplicationDelegate application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:] and check for it in applicationDidBecomeActive which is not an optimal solution for many reasons.
