    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the Siri language is set to English, and I ask Siri to calculate a square root, it will give me the answer directly by asking WolframAlpha. However, if Siri is set to Spanish, it will do a web search for my question instead.\r\n\r\nThe same problem seems to exist with other \"advanced\" mathematical questions (ie. other than simple +-*/ arithmetic) which are routed to WolframAlpha when Siri is in English, since \"What is the integral of the square root\" goes to WolframAlpha and gives the right answer (impressive!) but \"Cuál es la integral de la raíz cuadrada\" makes a simple web search. However, unlike the square root (which W|A already understands in Spanish, and even if it didn't, Siri could special-case it to translate or to calculate directly without W|A), supporting complicated maths in Spanish needs further work by Wolfram, so that's not what this bug report is for.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure Siri to English (United States).\r\n2. Ask Siri \"What is the square root of 16?\"\r\n3. Siri will say \"The answer is 4.\" and display a 'card' from WolframAlpha with the input in mathematical symbols and the result. See attachment siri-sqrt-english.png.\r\n\r\n4. Configure Siri to Spanish (Mexico).\r\n5. Ask Siri \"Cuál es la raíz cuadrada de 16?\"\r\n6. Siri will do a Bing web search for \"raíz cuadrada de 16\" and show the results (the first of which currently happens to be a Yahoo! Answers post which answers the question but also mocks people for not already knowing the answer). See attachment siri-sqrt-spanish.png.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should be able to interpret requests for square roots in any language, and either pass them to WolframAlpha or (better) calculate them directly just like for basic +-*/ arithmetic.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri doesn't interpret my Spanish request for a square root and falls back to doing a web search.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know I'm using an old iOS version, but I'm pretty sure this Siri bug is server-side, and upgrading to iOS 8 wouldn't fix it. However, I'll have access to an iOS 8.4 device tomorrow and will try to reproduce it there.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation, 32GB, A1421, MD720E/A"
