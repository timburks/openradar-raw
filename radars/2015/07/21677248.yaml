    description: "Summary:\r\nOS X Swift Playgrounds run in a sandbox where network access is permitted, but other prohibited-by-default actions are not. My motivation for filing this bug is that I’d like to be able to use a serial port in a playground. Use of serial ports requires a com.apple.security.device.serial entitlement in a sandboxed application. To my knowledge, it is not currently possible to specify custom sandbox entitlements for a Swift playground.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to open a serial port from a Swift playground.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe serial port opens successfully and can be used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe open() call returns error code 1, “Operation Not Permitted”\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached workspace, containing a playground demonstrates the problem. It assumes a serial port at /dev/cu.usbmodem14411 . This will need to be changed to a path to a valid serial port on the machine where it is being run, of course.\r\n\r\n(Attachment can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/w49prikhuzkgjmc/SerialPlayground.zip?dl=0)"
