        Summary:
        It can be helpful to dynamically crawl a type hierarchy to get the list of types that conform to a protocol. For instance, one might want to have different modules for implementing some functionality that can be swapped out at runtime, and to look these up at run time rather than having a duplicated static list. objc_getClassList allows us to do this with classes, but in some cases value types would be more appropriate.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a protocol
        2. Create a struct that conforms to the protocol
        3. Call objc_getClassList looking for the struct

        Expected Results:
        I would expect to find the struct

        Actual Results:
        It does not include the struct

        Regression:
