    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for [NSTabViewController tabStyle] lists four possible enum values, the last one being NSTabViewControllerTabStyleUnspecified which the description ‘A style that indicates the the tab view controller does not provide the tab selection UI. Your app provides the control (such as an NSSegmentedControl or NSPopUpButton) for navigating between tabs. You can bind an existing control to the tab view controller object so that interactions with the control automatically change tabs.’\r\n\r\nWhen I change this to the Unspecified style in code IB the end result still displays the NSSegmentedControl in a similar way to .TabsOnTop but not exactly the same.\r\n\r\nIf I change the tabStyle programmatically in viewDidLoad then this bug is not exhibited\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Add a new NSTabViewController to your layout in a storyboard.\r\n2.) Change the Tab View Controller ‘Style’ property to ‘Unspecified’.\r\n3.) Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt this point you should not see the NSSegmented Control.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou do see the NSSegmentedControl.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe provided attachment is a very simple project demonstrating this problem. If you uncomment the line in ‘TestTabViewController’ you will see it work as I would expect from IB."
