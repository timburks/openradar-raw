        Summary:
        See below.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. This code:
        struct S {}
        enum E<F> {
        	case C
        }
        extension E where F == S {
        	static var C: S { return S(.C) }
        }

        Expected Results:
        should not crash swiftc

        Actual Results:
        but totally does:

        Assertion failed: (nominal), function validatePatternBindingDecl, file /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/swiftlang/swiftlang-700.0.45/src/swift/lib/Sema/TypeCheckDecl.cpp, line 1470.

        Regression:
        If the name of the variable differs, it doesn’t crash.
        If the type isn’t generic, it doesn’t crash.
        If S doesn’t exist, it doesn’t crash.
        If the variable is defined in the enum body and not the extension, it doesn’t crash.

        Notes:
        If the variable is not static, you get a different stack trace and no assertion failure.
