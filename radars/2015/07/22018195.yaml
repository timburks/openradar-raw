    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a workspace with multiple projects in it, if any of the projects contain a class with the same name as a class in another project (ie. ViewController), cntrl-dragging to create an outlet connection to that class will create the declaration in the other project's class.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new workspace.\r\n2. Create a first new project - iOS/Application/Single View Application\r\n3. Options for first project: Language:Swift, Devices:iPhone\r\n4. Add first project to the workspace.\r\n5. Create a second new project - iOS/Application/Single View Application\r\n6. Options for second project: Language:Swift, Devices:iPhone\r\n7. Add second project to the workspace.\r\n8. Create a third new project - iOS/Application/Single View Application\r\n9. Options for third project: Language:Swift, Devices:iPhone\r\n10. Add third project to the workspace.\r\n11. Open Main.storyboard in project 3 and add a UILabel to the ViewController’s View\r\n12. Open corresponding ViewController class in Assistant Editor.\r\n13. Control drag from label to ViewController class to create an outlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the outlet declaration to be added to the class. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLine blinks like outlet declaration is being added to the class, but it never appears in the class and instead\r\nand the declaration is added to a different project’s ViewController class\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t) & OS X Version 10.10.4 (14E46)"
