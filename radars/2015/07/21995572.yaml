    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I delete a message thread on my iPhone, I almost always want that same thread deleted across my Mac and Apple Watch as well. However, currently I have to individually delete a single thread three different times on each of my devices. When I delete a thread, I should be prompted to delete the thread across all of my devices using that Apple ID for iMessage. \r\n\r\nBonus points if I could toggle this on as the default behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Swipe to the left on a thread on iPhone\r\n2. Tap Delete\r\n3. A UIAlertController comes up asking \"Would you like to delete this thread on \"MacBook Pro Name\" and \"Apple Watch Name\" as well?\r\n4. I tap Yes. Thread deleted on all devices. Easy peasy.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like to be able to delete a thread and have it delete across all of my devices that use iMessage\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to delete a single thread multiple times for every single one of my devices that uses iMessage."
