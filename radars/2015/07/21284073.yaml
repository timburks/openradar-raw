    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Media Service allows an accessory to receive metadata for the currently active media playback. It also allows an accessory to send certain commands to the currently active player, for example \"Play\", \"Next Track\", etc.\r\n\r\nWhen no player is active -- in other words, no app is currently playing any media -- the user has to pull out the phone, go into an app and press play from there. From the point of view of a user using an AMS-enabled remote control accessory, this is not ideal at all.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the accessory would be able to enumerate the available players (i.e. \"Music\", \"Podcasts\", \"Spotify\", ...), display the names of the players to the user on the remote control accessory. The user would then select one, which would cause the accessory to send a command to activate that player to the iOS device.\r\n\r\nAn app indicates to iOS that it is capable of media playback by registering for commands through +[MPRemoteCommandCenter sharedCenter]. This mechanism is already existing since iOS 7.1. So from the iOS apps-side no new API needs to be added to support this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
