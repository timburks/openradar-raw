    description: "Guillermo Ignacio Enriquez Gutierrez15-Jul-2015 03:56 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes when observing notifications is a implementation detail I don't want to be exposed. However with current functionality. This cannot be done since a crash will happen when the selector or a Notification is private.\r\n\r\nNow I have no choice but to make the method public or internal, exposing the function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start observing a notification with a private method as a handler\r\n2. Fire the notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification handler is called normally even if it is private\r\n\r\nThe private handler func is not shown in the generated interface in Xcode (Xcode > Navigate > Jump to generated interface)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification handler is not called. Due to \"unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xabc...\"\r\n\r\nThe handler func is shown in the generated interface in Xcode (Xcode > Navigate > Jump to generated interface). It exposes partial implementation details\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso reproducible in Xcode6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
