    description: "Summary:\r\nAn Xcode bot integration with warnings but no errors is missing XCS_PRODUCT and XCS_ARCHIVE environment variables in post-build script as well as any build products.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a workspace with multiple dependent subprojects\r\n2. Create an Xcode bot with a post-integration trigger script\r\n3. Integrate the bot\r\n4. Observe the environment variables for the after-integration script\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe environment variables will have the XCS_PRODUCT and XCS_ARCHIVE environment variables, as well as built products in the appropriate folder locations.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe environment variables XCS_PRODUCT and XCS_ARCHIVE, as well as any built products are missing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Server 4.1.3 (14S1127)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBuilding this project using Xcode bots without a workspace or dependent subprojects behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode Server 4.1.3 (14S1127), OS X Yosemite 10.10.4"
