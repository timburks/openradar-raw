    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is not possible to create an \"open file alarm\" using applescript and following several instructions posted online, that are meant to achieve this goal. The script doesn't fail, display an error nor a warning, but, either way, the alarm is not created.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open \"Script Editor\"\r\n2. Create a new script that creates an open file alarm in a calendar event (or use the attached example script)\r\n3. Run the script\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn \"open file alarm\" is created in the corresponding calendar event\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo alarm is created. There's also no error or warning displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.3\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther alarms can be successfully created (e.g. sound alarms, email alarms).\r\n\r\nVarious tests where made following several online instructions and example source codes and by using several different syntaxes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nScript Editor version 2.7\r\nCalendar version 8.0\r\nOS X 10.10.3"
