    description: "Summary:\nWhen switching between different integrations, it would be great if Xcode presented the same selected Tab as the previous integration. \n\nFor example, if I am looking at the Commits tab of Integration N and switch to Integration N-1, I would like the Commits tab to be automatically selected. For me."
