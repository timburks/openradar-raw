        Summary:
        Structs that conform to a certain protocol should be able to implement properties as lazy stored properties without breaking protocol conformity.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Declare this

        protocol R {
        	var name: String { get }
        }

        struct A: R {
        	lazy var name: String = {
        		return "John Doe"
        		}()
        }

        Expected Results:
        Type ’A’ conforms to protocol ‘R’.

        Actual Results:
        Type ’A’ does not conform to protocol ‘R’.

        Regression:
        N.A.

        Notes:
        This only applies to Structs, Classes can implement properties as lazy stored properties without breaking protocol conformity.
