        In Xcode 6.2, simulating a force touch in the simulator was done via mouse press-and-hold. In Xcode 7, this no longer works and is replaced by a tap/force switch buried deep in the menu.

        This is awfully inconvenient, as you have to switch the tap mode before you can even trigger a force touch menu.

        My recommendation would be to hook up this thing called the *right mouse button* to simulate force clicks. This would be much more convenient without the potential ambiguity of a long-press.
