    description: "Summary:\r\nIn SceneKit, when using the scene.background.contents property to display a cubemap (by setting it to an array of strings designating the 6 pictures to use), and when drawing the scene in a SCNTechnique using the DRAW_SCENE mode, the cubemap is not displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS>Game>SceneKit project using the template in Xcode.\r\n2. Add a picture to the project\r\n3. Set the scene.background.contents property to an array of 6 strings (6 times the name of the picture)\r\n4. Check that the cubemap is display correctly by running the app\r\n5. Load a SCNTechnique with one pass, set to DRAW_SCENE and outputing to COLOR, and set it to the view.technique property\r\n6. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scene is drawn entirely, including its cubemap background\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scene is drawn without its background.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 [12H143]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached project for a demo.\r\nI'm not sure if this is really a bug: the documentation of SCNTechnique is not clear on this, stating that DRAW_SCENE  \"renders the entire scene\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5c 16GB"
