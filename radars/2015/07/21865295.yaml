    description: "Summary:\nAt WWDC 2014, in the talk ‘Localizing with Xcode 6’ around the 38:20 mark, the presenter showed a slide that contained the new options, “-exportLocalizations” and -“importLocalizations”. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Run xcodebuild with the -importLocalizations flag\n\nExpected Results:\nYou should be able to import localizations (from xliff files) into a project via the command line.\n\nActual Results:\nxcodebuild complains that “-importLocalizations” is an invalid option.\n\nRegression:\nIt was shown off in WWDC 2014, and perhaps worked before, but no longer does in Xcode 6.4"
