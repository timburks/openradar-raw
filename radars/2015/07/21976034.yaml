    description: "Summary:\r\nClosed as duplicate of 16659653 (Open)\r\nWhen entering Swift code in strongly typed situations, Xcode's autocomplete does not recognize the member name without first entering the enumeration type name.  Although the compiler allows having just the member name in these situations, autocomplete has to have the enum type name before listing the members.  \r\n\r\nIt would be a wonderful time saver, it autocomplete would recognize these situations and list the members after typing the \".\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n//In Swift (playground or .swift file), type:\r\nenum CompassPoint {\r\n    case North, South, East, West\r\n}\r\nlet direction: CompassPoint = .\r\n/*After typing the period, autocomplete should provide the member names.  It acts dumb and doesn't recognize that the member names of type CompassPoint should be provided. */\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter typing the \".\" above, autocomplete should list all the members of type CompassPoint\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter typing the period, autocomplete acts dumb and doesn't recognize that this is a strongly typed situation and that the member names of type CompassPoint should be provided.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7, Beta 4, OSX 10.10.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would a tremendous time saver and better align the capabilities of the Swift language with the IDE"
