    description: "Summary:\r\nI build a proprietary SDK for a living at Lookback, where we ship a static archive .framework. We have so far been able to ship a single distribution for all OSes and Xcodes, and would love to continue doing so. However, enabling Bitcode and doing Build & Archive in Xcode 7 generates a static library which has duplicate symbols when linked with an app in Xcode 6.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a “Static Library” project in Xcode 7\r\n2. Enable Bitcode on it\r\n3. Build and Archive\r\n4. Create an “iOS App” project in Xcode 6\r\n5. Link the previous static library into this app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6. Works fine\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n7. Duplicate symbols\r\n\r\n\r\nduplicate symbol _llvm.cmdline in:\r\n    ../HD/Lookback.framework/Lookback(Lookback.o)\r\n    ../HD/Lookback.framework/Lookback(GFUIKitFunctions.o)\r\nduplicate symbol _llvm.embedded.module in:\r\n    ../HD/Lookback.framework/Lookback(Lookback.o)\r\n    ../HD/Lookback.framework/Lookback(GFUIKitFunctions.o)\r\n… and so on for quite a while\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHaven’t had a compatibility issue like this since Universal Binaries were introduced :/\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCould you perhaps add an UUID suffix to the symbols? Or the name/path of the module? E g “_llvm.embedded.module. 7464665a-2ce4-11e5-b345-feff819cdc9f”. Then this information would just be discarded by older Xcodes, and not interfere with the arm7/arm64 symbols that the app actually links with."
