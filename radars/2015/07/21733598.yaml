        Summary: I would like to sync curated Apple Music playlists to my Apple Watch. Specifically the Running or Workout activity ones, which seem ideally suited for that. They don’t show up in the iOS Watch app > Music section though.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        - Find an Apple Music curated playlist you’d like to listen to on your watch. Example: Working Out to Indie, Vol. 1
        - Select Add to My Music. It shows up under the Apple Music Playlists section of iTunes. (Screenshot attached)
        - Go into iOS Watch app
        - Go into Music section
        - Go into Synced Playlist


        Expected Results:
        The playlist you just added to My Music should show up

        Actual Results:
        It’s not available in the list

        Notes:

        This was probably intentional but I can’t figure out why. I am able to individually add each song from one of these playlists to my own playlist and then sync it, but it’s an annoying number of steps.

        It seems extremely obvious behaviour, especially when you see Apple Watch marketed for health and fitness, and there are even Running activity playlists. It seems like a match made in heaven.

        This MacWorld article confirms my findings:

        “You can also add playlists that Apple Music’s curators have created—I like the pre-built workout soundtracks—but you have to add them to playlists you’ve made, otherwise they won’t show up in the iPhone Watch app’s Music section. “
