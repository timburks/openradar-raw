    description: "Summary:\r\nThe code which retrieves the actual data inside item() may fail, e.g. due to network error when downloading an image.\r\n\r\nWhen the retrieval of the data fails iOS 8 SDK and earlier allowed returning nil to not provide an item (as there is none). With iOS 9 SDK the function must now return some instance of a class which is definitely not supported by any UIActivity (or by any app extension) to achieve the same result.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement the item() method to retrieve some data which is loaded of the network.\r\n2. Think about how to handle the error case when the data could not be retrieved.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nitem() return value should be nullable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nitem() return value is non-nullable."
