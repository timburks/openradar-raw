    description: "Summary:\r\nCore Image performance when using the iOS simulator is pretty atrocious.  It is slower than on a old iOS device.  I guess CI has bad performance for the same reasons OpenGL ES performance is bad on the simulator.  \r\n\r\nThis bad performance makes using Core Image in the the iOS simulator an unpleasant experience.\r\n\r\nPlease make the performance better.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse CoreImage filters in the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNice snappy performance.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLaggy, chuggy, order of magnitude worse than device performance.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.3.2 (6D2105)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tested this with Xcode 7 and iOS 9 beta 1 and it has equally bad performance in the simulator.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8.3 Simulator, Xcode 6.3.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
