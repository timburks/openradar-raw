    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen pausing Apple Music for more than a few minutes, upon resuming the error “The song [] cannot be played because you are not signed in to Apple Music” is shown.  I am still signed into iTunes according to the UI.  I am completely unable to resume playback either by tapping play or choosing another song.  Playback works fine if I quit and relaunch iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes “For You” and play one of the suggestions\r\n2. Pause playback\r\n3. Wait for a small duration (happens 100% if left for over 20 mins, have been unable to narrow it down any more than this)\r\n4. Press play\r\n5. Observe “The song [] cannot be played because you are not signed in to Apple Music” Alert View\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayback should continue from where it left off\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayback is not resumed, and Apple Music is completely unusable until iTunes is relaunched"
