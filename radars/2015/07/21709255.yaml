        Summary: iCloud Photo Library introduces an unacceptable lag when attaching a photos to a message.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Open Mail app
        2) Compose a new message
        3) Tap on the blank space, scroll over on the menu bar and select Insert Photo or Video

        Expected Results:

        The photo selector screen should come up immediately.

        Actual Results:

        I was able to count off 20 seconds before the photo appeared. Not a typo, twenty.

        Notes:
        I have iCloud Photo Library enabled and over 28,000 photos in my library. This is just one of many unacceptable performance slowdowns when iCloud Photo Library is enabled.

        Here is another: rdar://21708840

        Note: The network activity indicator was spinning the first few times I tried this, but not the last one.
