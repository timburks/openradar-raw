        Summary:
        The storyboard editor should automatically create a Navigation Item when a View Controller is connected to a Navigation Controller so that the title can be edited without manually adding a Navigation Item first.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode and create a new iOS Single View Application project.
        2. Open Main.storyboard
        3. Select the View Controller and use Editor > Embed In > Navigation Controller.
        4. Add a Button to the View Controller using the Object Library
        5. Add another View Controller to the Storyboard using the Object Library
        6. Create a show segue from the button to the 2nd view controller
        7. Double-click the navigation item of the view controller that was created when creating the project: the title can be edited.
        8. Double-click the navigation item of the view controller that was manually added.

        Expected Results:
        The title should be editable.

        Actual Results:
        The title cannot be edited because the View Controller is missing a Navigation Item. Workaround: adding a Navigation Item using the Object Library manually. Probably the navigation item should be automatically created/enabled when the connection to the UINavigationController is established via the segue (and for some kind of segues, f.e. the root view controller segue, the navigation item is automatically created)
