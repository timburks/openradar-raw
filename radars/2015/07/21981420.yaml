    description: Since compiler can already detect when enum/case should be indirect and report errors if we leave out the indirect keyword, why canâ€™t it just make it indirect automatically for us. That is to say, indirect should be an implementation detail that is handled by compiler instead of by programmer. To a programmer, enum is just enum.
