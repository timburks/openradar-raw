    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using a Show (Push) Segue to bring up a new ViewController for my app: Supernova  (com.arjan.iphone.supernova)\r\n\r\nOn iOS 8, it works and gives my back button in the NavigationBar without any additional work.\r\n\r\nBut on iOS 9 (beta 3): It brings up the ViewController without the Back button. It also brings up the VC from the bottom which is how 'Present Modally' Segues work.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for my app because the user is unable to go back to the previous screen since there is no Back button.\r\n\r\nScreenshots attached which show iOS 8 back buttons and iOS 9 missing back button.\r\n\r\nI also tried to manually add back buttons to the navigation controller but it still didn't show up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download App: \"Supernova: Group Photo Sharing\" (link: https://appsto.re/us/K8oL6.i)\r\n2. Log in\r\n3. Click on 'Sample Album'\r\n4. The Navigation Bar shows but Back button is missing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNavigation Bar should have Back Button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n The Navigation Bar shows but Back button is missing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 Beta 3 [13A4293g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome other developers also have this issue, see apple forum:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/4201"
