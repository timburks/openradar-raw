    description: "Summary:\r\nA lot of apps use Cmd+ (aka Cmd-Shift-=) to zoom in, but this command does not work with the \"Dvorak - Qwerty Cmd\" keyboard layout. \r\n\r\nIn the \"Dvorak - Qwerty Cmd\" layout, holding the command key should change the keyboard layout to standard Qwerty instead of Dvorak, and it works very well. BUT, it doesn't seem to work for Cmd+. Cmd- (zoom out) does work. In addition, if I try to use the Dvorak version of the + key (Cmd-Shift-} in standard Qwerty), the correct Dvorak - Qwerty Cmd shortcut for that key is executed instead of the wrong (zoom in) one. So it appears to be specific to Cmd+.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this could be fixed, because it's very frustrating to be able to zoom out via the keyboard, but not zoom in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change keyboard layout to Dvorak - Qwerty Cmd in System Preferences.\r\n2. Open http://apple.com in Safari. \r\n3. Hit Cmd- to zoom out.\r\n4. Hit Cmd+ to zoom back in.\r\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 with Chrome or another app (this is NOT a Safari specific bug)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCmd+ should zoom in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens in Safari. In Chrome you will switch tabs (meaning the mapping is still Dvorak even though the Cmd key is held down).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11 Beta (15A216g), but I've noticed this in previous versions of OS X like 10.10.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
