    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a calendar entry linking to https://primarschule-margelaecker.schule-wettingen.ch/aktuell/2015/3/29/projektwoche-\"alles-mist\" (for Example).\r\n\r\nOn the mac, this links correctly when clicked (see attachment). On iOS, however, it seems like the text in the URL field is not linked directly but via URL autodetection, which fails. Clicking the link only opens the highlighted text as URL, not the complete URL field.\r\n\r\nSince this field is designated as a URL field, it should be just linkified without autodetection.\r\n\r\nI know I could just replace the quotes in the URL with correctly URL-encoded %22 but this won’t work for subscribed calendars.\r\nAlso there is a separate issue (which I will file shortly) in which calendar (on both iOS and OS X) actually transforms the %22 inside imported and subscribed .ics files in the URL field back into a quote…\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subscribe to https://primarschule-margelaecker.schule-wettingen.ch/aktuell/calendar.ics (or the attached testcase.ics)\r\n2. Locate the event called “Projektwoche \"Alles Mist\"”\r\n3. Open the URL associated with the event.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari opens on https://primarschule-margelaecker.schule-wettingen.ch/aktuell/2015/3/29/projektwoche-%22alles-mist%22\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari opens on https://primarschule-margelaecker.schule-wettingen.ch/aktuell/2015/3/29/projektwoche-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta (13A4305g)"
