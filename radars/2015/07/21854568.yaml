    description: "Safari makes it easy to fill in password, and Safari 9 provides much better access to a variety of Keychain/Password features, BUT the one thing that’s missing is an easier way to generate a password with special requirements. \n\nFor example, on Hyatt’s website (goldpassport.hyatt.com), I’m trying to update my account password. I use the Safari-generated password, but they tell me special characters are not allowed (see screenshot). Clicking on the key icon on the right side does offer a few options, but none to help me fix this problem. \n\nMost users in this scenario will fall back to making up their own (crappy) password). \n\nI would suggest offering a way to generate passwords in other formats. Probably the most common fix would be to allow the user to generate one with only mixed case letters and numbers, no dashes. \n\nAnd maybe a fallback of “Open Keychain Password Generator” that could open up the password generating engine available in Keychain Access."
