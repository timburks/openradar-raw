    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen entering a reminder using Siri, making a correction to the dictation results in a second reminder, rather than correcting the first\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tell Siri “Remind me to cast my vote”\r\n2. Siri transcribes that as “Remind me to cast hello” and tells me my reminder is created\r\n3. Tap on “hello”\r\n4. Choose “Select”\r\n5. Type “vote”\r\n6. Tap “Done” on the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri amends the reminder created after step 2 to read “vote”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI now have two reminders: one reading “hello” and the other reading “vote”"
