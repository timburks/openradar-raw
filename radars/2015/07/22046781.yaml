    description: "Summary:\r\nMail in iOS 9 added icons to the actions that appear when a row is swiped in the list of messages. This is a super helpful addition that should be easily available to all apps.\r\n\r\nIdeally UITableViewRowAction should have an image property. You could set an image to use as a template, and the system would place and style that image for you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
