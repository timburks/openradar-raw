        Summary:
        OS X Server trashes OpenDirectory/OpenLDAP data on UPS shutdown

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use OpenDirectory with some/many users. Have a UPS and have OS X server shutdown itself in an orderly manner due to power loss while running on UPS power. Restart the machine once power is back.

        Expected Results:
        Server should startup by itself once UPS power reaches the appropriate level. All services should automatically launch successfully.

        Actual Results:
        OS X Server does not power on automatically, even after a prolonged period and full UPS charge.
        OpenDirectory is completely hosed and looks like it has been reset to factory defaults losing all userdata.

        Regression:
        Restoring /var/db/openldap from a backup and rebooting the server brings back OpenDirectory.
        The ability for admins to login to the system remotely may be inhibited due to loss of user accounts.

        Notes:
        This also happens on normal regular admin induced shutdowns, but more rarely.
        Trust in OS X Server reliability is severely damaged since after 10.6.8.
