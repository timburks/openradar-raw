    description: "See some screenshots at http://www.openradar.me/21782228\r\n\r\nMore than often, we don't know what kind of iPhone or Watch we are currently running. Sure, it's in the Window Title... But this one is mostly too small to read anything else than \"Simulator\" (which, really, shouldn't be part of the Window Title)"
