    description: "In iOS9, Spotlight can suggest apps from the App Store related to the searched items. But when those apps are installed and then launched by the user, they don’t directly show the expected contents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn the WWDC 2015 session 709 (https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=709), the example at 8:25 is of a user searching Spotlight for a \"sprained ankle”. Spotlight then suggests the Mayo Clinic app, and can download it directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should then be able to simply tap to open the Mayo Clinic app and directly get info about sprained ankle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the user then opens the app, it’s started normally. The `continueUserActivity:` message isn’t sent to the app delegate, and there’s no way for it to now which item it should present."
