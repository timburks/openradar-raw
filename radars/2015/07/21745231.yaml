        Summary:
        iOS 9 provides an option to disable/enable character preview on the keyboard. This behavior has been on iOS since iOS 1, and is incredibly important to the usability of the iOS keyboard, but is currently defaulted to off in the current iOS 9 betas.

        A few notes:

        * When typing, I typically look AT the keyboard. Character Preview allows me to confirm I am entering the text correctly.
        * With the option set to off, the keyboard visually felt like it was hanging/lagging, because there was no UI feedback that I had actually pressed a key. 8 years of looking for the character preview have trained me to look for the magnified key. In addition, when iOS has lagged/hung in the past, the delayed response of character preview has been a key indicator. Not seeing the preview immediately leads me to believe something is wrong. Itâ€™s not a pleasant feeling.
        * When entering data into a secure text field, the character preview appears regardless of this option. This leads me to believe the better, more usable default is to set this to ON.
        * I type SIGNIFICANTLY slower with this option set to off, because I have to look for the key, THEN look to the textfield to confirm it was entered correctly.
