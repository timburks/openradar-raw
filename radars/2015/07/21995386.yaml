    description: "In iOS 9 beta 1 and beta 2, the feature to use two fingers on the keyboard to move the cursor around and to select text was very helpful. This feature was missing in beta 3, and now again in beta 4, on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Install iOS beta 1 on an iPhone. \r\n2. Place two fingers on the keyboard and move around to watch the cursor freely move on the screen. \r\n3. Upgrade to beta 3 or 4 and watch in horror as this no longer works. \r\n4. Cry. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: The two finger trackpad mode should work on iPhone as well as iPad. \r\n\r\nActual Results: Two finger trackpad mode does not work on iPhone. \r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 9 beta 3 and beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes: I wanted to let you know that I appreciate all your work and that you are looking especially dapper today."
