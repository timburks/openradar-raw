        Summary:
        A custom complication does not update automatically in the background on the watch. It only updates when specifically requested (such as via the watch app via extendTimelineForComplication )

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Build a custom complication that fetches data from the network to update itself (mine is using simple modular text)
        2. Activate that complication.
        3. Wait 24 hours.
        4. Your complication has not updated.

        Expected Results:
        I would expect the complication to fetch a new value for itself in a timely manner. Ideally this would be a fairly frequent interval, but I understand that itâ€™s subject to budgeting.

        Actual Results:
        The complication just does not update unless the app specifically requests it via extendTimelineForComplication, etc.

        Regression:
        N/A
