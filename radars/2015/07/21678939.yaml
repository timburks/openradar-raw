    description: "Summary:\r\nAs UILongPressGestureRecognizer is a continuous recognizer it acts somewhat like UIPanGestureRecognizer.  However unlike pan it has no facility for measuring velocity in a view has the user moves their finger around.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse UILongPressGestureRecognizer and want to get the velocity of the gesture during UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged or UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded for example.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat you could get the velocity of the long press gesture's movement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't.  Instead you have to construct to mess of UIPanGestureRecognizer and UILongPressGestureRecognizer similtaneous recognizers or subclass UILongPressGestureRecognizer to do velocity sampling like the internal implementation of UIPanGestureRecognizer does.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.4 (6E35b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8 SDK\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
