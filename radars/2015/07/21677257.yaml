        Summary:
        I wake my computer and unlock. I then see all of my calendar reminders as notifications. I go to Notification Center and clear all the notifications. Then, when my computer locks again and I wake it back up, all the notifications appear again, and I have to once again clear them.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have some all day calendar notifications setup for today
        2. Wait for the notifications to appear for those events
        3. Launch Notification Center
        4. Go to Notifications tab
        5. Click the “x” next to Calendar to clear all the Calendar notifications
        6. Click it again if it’s a long list (this shouldn’t be necessary)
        7. Let computer go to sleep and lock again
        8. Wake the computer back up and unlock it

        Expected Results:
        No calendar notifications that you have already seen should be shown.

        Actual Results:
        All of the same calendar notifications are show again.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
