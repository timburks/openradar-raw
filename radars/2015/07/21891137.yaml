        Summary:
        When using prebuilt binary frameworks that include Swift code, with debug symbols copied from the machine where the binary was built, Xcode crashes when the debugger stops at a breakpoint.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/sharplet/BluetoothDetector.git
        2. Ensure breakpoints are enabled (the project includes shared breakpoints that reproduce the crash)
        3. Build and run in the iOS Simulator

        Expected Results:
        Xcode would pause at the breakpoint as it does on the machine where the ReactiveCocoa.framework binary and ReactiveCocoa.framework.dSYM files were built.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode crashes, while the app continues running in the simulator.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        Debug symbols were produced when the framework was built, and are copied into the project's BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR at build time. I've observed that if the framework and debug symbols are rebuilt on a different machine and then added to source control, Xcode no longer crashes on that machine. But the crashes then start to occur on the original machine.

        The Xcode crash report is attached.
