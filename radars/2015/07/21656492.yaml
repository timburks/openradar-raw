        Summary:
        Apple Music does not support the Continuity/Handoff APIs introduced in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use Apple Music on iOS in proximity of a device running OS X Yosemite and look to see if there’s a Handoff available in the Dock, or
        Use Apple Music on iTunes 12.2 in proximity of a device running iOS 8.4 and look to see if there’s a Handoff available on the lock screen.

        Expected Results:
        I expected to see an available Handoff on these devices.

        Actual Results:
        No Handoff was available.
