    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting in OS X 10.11 betas, using \"sudo\" or other apps that prompt the user for password using a standard password requestion function causes a \"key icon\" that strongly implies typing is secure. Previously the icon was a kind of \"bullet\" that effectively implied that typing would not be visible, but didn't as strongly imply that typing was secure.\r\n\r\nAs I requested in Radar #19189911, typing should be secured from prying eyes of e.g. system event taps while the Terminal is prompting for secure input. In lieu of that support, the icon shouldn't so strongly convey security that isn't being provided.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A235d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NotSecure.png' was successfully uploaded."
