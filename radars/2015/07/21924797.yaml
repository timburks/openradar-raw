        Summary:
        None of the iOS 9 Betas have appeared for me in Settings > General > Software Update. Admittedly, I've only waited up to an hour or two before manually updating using the bits on developer.apple.com, but in the past they've appeared near instantly. I've also tried rebooting my device - still doesn't appear.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to Settings > General > Software Update

        Expected Results:
        I expect to be able to see the new iOS 9 Beta and update my iPhone

        Actual Results:
        I have to manually update my iPhone
