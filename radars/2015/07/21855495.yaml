    description: |-
        As mentioned in rdar://21855393 the Schemes menu can sometimes get a bit too large, and is then more likely to exhibit this bug: when Xcode’s window is too narrow, the Schemes menu doesn’t just shrink down or adapt, it completely disappears. The only clue a user has as to what might be happening is a small >> callout menu on the right side of the toolbar. If you click that, a greyed out “Schemes” option appears. If the user stretches the window wider (if it’s even possible at their screen resolution), the menu appears again.

        The menu should be made to never completely disappear.
