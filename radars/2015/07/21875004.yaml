    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that Xcode bot trigger scripts have a 10 second timeout - which is far too short to do any useful work.  I can replicate this by adding a \"Before Integration\" trigger containing nothing but a call to \"sleep 10\".  When the integration runs, it fails with the error \"terminated xcodebuild since it produced no output for too long\".\r\n \r\nIs there any way to override the length of this timeout?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Version 7.0 beta 3 (7A152u)\r\n2. Install OS X Server 4.1.52 (15S2157i)\r\n3. Enable Xcode Server using above Xcode version\r\n4. Create an Xcode iOS Application project\r\n5. Create a bot from this project\r\n6. Add a Before Integration trigger script containing only the line:\r\n    sleep 10\r\n7. Run the integration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScript runs (sleeps) for 10 seconds, after which the build completes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScript is terminated with the error \"terminated xcodebuild since it produced no output for too long\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 3 (7A152u)\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A204h)\r\nOS X Server 4.1.52 (15S2157i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is of course a contrived test.  The script will be terminated in this manner no matter what it is doing, even if it is producing output.\r\n\r\nDev Forum thread: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/9812\r\n\r\nRelated Stack Overflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31377758/xcode-7-bots-fastlane-how-to-automatically-deploy-an-app-to-itunes-connect"
