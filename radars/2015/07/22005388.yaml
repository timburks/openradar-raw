    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I create a class in Swift, I will usually expose it to Objective-C with a different name, to allow for prefixing. So far, so good. However, if I make an extension of the class, it no longer builds. The reason being that, while the original class name changed for Objective-C, the extension's class name did not change...\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project that is using both Swift and Objective-C.\r\n\r\n2. Paste the following class and extension into some Swift file:\r\n\r\n@objc(MyProjectMyClass)\r\nclass MyClass: NSObject { }\r\n\r\nextension MyClass { }\r\n\r\n3. Include MyProject-Swift.h in one of the Objective-C files\r\n\r\n4. Try to build the project.\r\n\r\n5. Look at the errors; specifically the MyProject-Swift.h header. The problem area in question looks like this: \r\n\r\nSWIFT_CLASS_NAMED(\"MyClass\")\r\n@interface MyProjectMyClass : NSObject\r\n- (nonnull instancetype)init OBJC_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n\r\n@interface MyClass (SWIFT_EXTENSION(MyProject))\r\n@end\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect it to rename the extension to be the same as the class itself, and be able to compile.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt creates an extension off of a class that does not exist, and accordingly fails to compile ><\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\nXcode 7 beta 4 (7A165t)"
