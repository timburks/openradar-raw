    description: "Summary:\r\nWrote a custom keyboard extension in Swift that works great on in any iOS app (Notes, Messages, etc..). The problem is that when you initially install it (ie: add it to the list of iOS keyboards) the keyboard is not available (not listed as a keyboard option on next keyboard key press) on the iOS Home screen (after you log in say when you want to search, or change the names of folders, etc..). The keyboard becomes available here only after reseting the device. This started occuring with iOS 8.3 (persists in 8.4). Previous version of iOS (8.0-8.2) did not have this problem.  There is nothing special about the keyboard, it basically just follows the standard example Apple provided.. The keyboard does not require the user to provide Open Access and has the ASCII enabled flag enabled in info.plist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Install third party keyboard extension that follows apples example on iOS 8.3+ device.\r\n2) Enable extension via Settings Menu\r\n2) Goto home screen and swipe down to activate Spotlite\r\n3) Press and hold the \"next keyboard\" key, verify the keyboard is not available.\r\n4) Reset the device.\r\n5) log in and again activate Spotlight.\r\n6) Press and hold \"next keyboard\" key to confirm the keyboard is now available\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeyboard should be available on home screen after enabling in settings menu, restart should not be required.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRestart is required to make keyboard available on home screen."
