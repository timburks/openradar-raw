    description: "Summary:\r\nWe've been experiencing a cryptic crash (SQLite can't bind intarray) in our app. It always happens on a line where we are batch faulting a large number of objects into memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWe don't have any reproduction internally of the issue. The crash is reported by our crash reporting software and doesn't happen in house when we execute the same line of code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe would expect the crash to not happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0, 8.0.2, 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3, 8.2, 8.3+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are mainly looking for an explanation of the error ( 'CoreData: SQLite: error: Can't bind intarray.', reason: 'SQLite error code: 14'). We have searched on google and pieced through the SQLite source code to no avail.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 2 (Wi-Fi+LTE), iPad Air (Wi-Fi), iPad mini (A1455), iPad (4th gen, A1459), iPad (3rd gen, Wi-Fi+LTE AT&T), iPad 2 (Wi-Fi), iPad Air 2 (Wi-Fi+LTE),"
