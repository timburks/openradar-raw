        Summary:

        Mac developers pay the same 30% of earnings that iOS developers pay, but they get much less support from Apple for that fee.

        On the Mac App Store, the following are nonexistent:

        • TestFlight
        • App Analytics
        • Blocking reviews for Beta OS
        • App bundles
        • Gifting of apps
        • Video previews in the App Store

        The iOS App Store has all these features.


        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Write a Mac app and sell it on the Mac App Store.
        2) Pay 30% of earnings to Apple.


        Expected Results:

        Equal treatment within Apple’s developer ecosystem. The Mac developer should have the same capabilities as iOS developers.


        Actual Results:

        The Mac developer is missing essential tools for their business and feels like a second-class citizen in the developer infrastructure.


        Regression:

        N/A


        Notes:

        The items listed above affect both our ability to test and market products. This has a negative impact for the developer, Apple, and customer alike.
