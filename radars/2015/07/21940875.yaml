    description: "Summary:\r\nThe quotation mark style in SF UI is optimized for English and other languages that use the same quotation style.\r\n\r\nWhat’s used as the English-language opening quote is used as the closing quote in German (and in quite a few other languages, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType this in SF UI and a typographer will be able to tell that the quotation mark after Berlin is aesthetically irritating.\r\n“San Francisco”\r\n„Berlin“\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlease refer to the attached image: Helvetica’s quotation marks are suitable for all languages. If the tapered style should be kept for stylistic purposes, a design similar to that of the Taz typeface would be better.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe closing quotation mark in German looks typographically wrong.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSF UI, version 11.0d45e1--BETA\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMicrosoft’s Verdana font has the same problem and it hasn’t been fixed in almost 20 years. :)\r\nA local (locl) OpenType feature could solve the issue by providing a different glyph if the language is known. A different style/design would be a more reliable solution though."
