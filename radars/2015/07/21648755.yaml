    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://21435591\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nRunning an iOS beta, I naturally run into a plethora of tiny things that I’d like to report to my good friends over at  engineering. Having to return to my MacBook to sanely do so, however, serves as a major hinderance to me filing all the things I’d like to. A native application, even if it were only available while running beta OS versions, would certainly encourage me to file more radars and perhaps even complain less on Twitter.\r\n\r\nThis Radar-filing app could automatically include system info, make finding (and attaching) crash reports from apps and the system easier, and also allow for easy upload of screenshots."
