Both point to the same PSC.\r\n\r\nChanges in a managed object in one context does not get updated when the other context perform a fetch request where shouldRefreshRefetchedObjects is set to true.\r\n\r\n\"refreshObject:mergeChanges:\" works though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Run the sample code\r\n* Tap \"Add and Save\" to create a managed object in the \"editor\" context.\r\n* Tap \"Fetch\" to fetch the object to the \"consumer\" context\r\n* Tap \"Modify and Save\" to modify and save the object in editing context.\r\n* Tap \"Fetch with refresh refetched\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe value in the label under \"Consumer\" section is updated to the same value in \"Editor\" section.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value is not updated."
