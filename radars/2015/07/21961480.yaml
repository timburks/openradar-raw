        Summary:
        In iOS 9, character preview appears to be off by default, so none of the keys will show which key was actually pressed before you pick up your finger.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Install iOS 9

        Expected Results:
        Each character should preview itself above your finger when pressed on the keyboard without changing any settings.

        Actual Results:
        Character preview is off by default, which is confusing and provides a poorer keyboard-typing experience on a touch-screen device.

        Regression:
        Does not occur in iOS 8
