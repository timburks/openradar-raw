        Since I updated from iOS 8.4 to iOS 9 beta 3, my phone hasn’t been able to back up to iCloud. Each morning, I get an error message complaining that there is not enough iCloud storage available to perform the backup. I also have an iPad on the iOS 9 beta and it’s showing similar behavior.

        Manually-initiated backups don’t seem to work either, although they don’t necessarily show an error message.

        I’m guessing this is a known issue, but I thought I’d mention it just in case it’s not. Please let me know if any additional information would be helpful.
