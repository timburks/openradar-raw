    description: "Summary:\r\nEspecially when using C++’s auto, but also when working in a longer function, it should be trivially easy to discover the type of a local variable or constant without jumping around.\r\n\r\nCurrently, however, this is not the case.\r\nThe easiest way that I have now, is starting to type the name of the symbol so that it appears in the auto–complete list. There the type is displayed in its full glory.\r\n\r\nIt would be very nice if there was an easier way.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, this is possible — including display of the current value — but not when reading through code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNeither\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDitto\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
