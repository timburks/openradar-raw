    description: "Summary:\r\nI recently had issues submitting beta app builds to TestFlight/iTunes Connect. Turning off Bitcode allowed me to submit the builds, but they got lost in an “Uploaded” state. After contacting the iTunes Connect support, my build was rejected saying that:\r\n\r\nInvalid Executable - The executable 'MyCntdwn.app/Frameworks/libswiftCore.dylib' contains bitcode.\r\n\r\nMy app contains a mixture of Objc and Swift code. \r\n\r\nThis is either an issue with iTunes Connect or Xcode. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Archive build in Xcode 7 beta 3. \r\n- Press “Upload to App Store…” button in Xcode Organizer. \r\n- Chose my team\r\n- Uncheck  “Include bitcode. Learn More”\r\n- Click Submit\r\n- Wait…\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should build a proper build without bitcode support. And iTunes Connect should know how to handle it.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBeta builds get stuck in limbo and contacting support results in the build being rejected. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is very discouraging."
