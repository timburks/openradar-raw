        There are situations where it’s possible to start playing a album from Apple Music (songs that haven’t been added to user’s library), but when when you switch tabs to Playlists, it just stops playing.

        Steps to reproduce:

        1. Download a single song from an album from Apple Music
        2. Go to My Music
        3. Open the album in “Recently added”
        4. Click “Show complete album” to display all songs
        5. Start playing one of the songs that’s not been downloaded
        6. (All songs from the album load up into “Up Next”)
        7. Click on the “Playlists” tab in the tab bar at the top

        Expected: The songs keep playing until I stop them or start playing a different album or playlists
        Actually: Playback just stops.

        Notes: It’s also possible to play the very same album from the Apple Music tabs (e.g. search it, and then it appears in the web-based view in New), and the problem doesn’t reproduce there — you can just keep listening to the music as you normally would.
