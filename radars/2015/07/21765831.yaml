    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the new lightweight generics in Objective–C, the types of the foundation containers — especially dictionaries — become quite a burden.\r\nWhen using Objective-C++, a lot of this pain can be alleviated by use of C++’s `auto` keyword, but for pure Objective–C, this is currently not an option.\r\n\r\nAlthough use of `auto` with Objective–C generics has a couple of limitations in its current form — more radars forthcoming — it’s better than nothing already.\r\n\r\nCome to speak of it, using `let` and `variable` to define type–inferred local symbols, would be even better than just hoisting over `auto` from C++–land.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://21765475"
