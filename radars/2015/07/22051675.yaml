    description: "On iOS9, canOpenURL: only works if the url scheme is declared in Info.plist. However, canOpenURL logs an unnecessary message to syslog even when the url scheme was correctly configured in Info.plist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a specific app URL scheme to LSApplicationQueriesSchemes in the Info.plist, and call canOpenURL: on it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncanOpenURL: should simply return YES or NO, depending on whether a compatible app is installed on the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncanOpenURL: does return the correct value, but if no app is installed, syslog contains this line:\r\n`canOpenURL: failed for URL: “urlscheme://“ - error: “(null)”`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis behaviour is intended and documented in https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=703, page 24 of the PDF.\r\n\r\nI believe this is unneeded, and actually not very helpful. It logs a correct usage of the API, and it looks similar to the real “This app is not allowed to query for scheme” messages.\r\n\r\nIn general, unwanted logs add noise, and hide real problems."
