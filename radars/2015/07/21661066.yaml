    description: "Summary:\r\nMail doesn't store passwords on keychain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure an IMAP Account in Mail.app.\r\nLet it sync. Quit Mail.app, maybe do a logout or restart for good measure.\r\nLog back in, open Mail.app and it will ask for all the passwords of the configured accounts.\r\nEnter the passwords accordingly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail.app should have kept the passwords to the email accounts on the user's keychain.\r\nLaunching Mail.app should fetch email.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail.app asks for all account's passwords over and over again and is never able to contact the server again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked in 10.8.5, 10.6.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only way to make any account work again in Mail.app is to complete remove all accounts, all config files and data related to Mail.app, restart the Mac and start configuring them all again. Then you can have a single session of accessing your email.\r\n\r\nMail.app has been unusable since 10.9.0 with Apple confirmed crashing bugs that Apple confirmed in writing not to fix in 10.9..x anymore.\r\nMail.app has been unusable for the above reason and this keychain issue for 22 months."
