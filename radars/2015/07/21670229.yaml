        Summary:
        I use View > Standard Editor > Show Document Items (control-6) quite heavily to filter and jump to a given symbol e.g. in the Swift module’s generated interface. However, since Swift allows overloading, and these symbols are displayed without their type signature—which is quite pertinent—you frequently get duplicate entries with nothing to disambiguate them.

        Note that the following example is a little bit contrived for clarity—probably you don’t care whether it’s the Float or Double log10 that you jump to, for example. This abstracts, however, and if I filter for `map` in the Swift module’s generated interface, I’m doomed to sadness.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the Darwin module’s generated interface, e.g. by typing “import Darwin” in a Swift file and then command-clicking it. (I don’t know a better way to get to it, which is worthy of a separate radar).
        2. Type control 6.
        3. When the Show Document Items menu is visible, type “log” to filter the menu.
        4. Behold.


        Expected Results:
        I expected to be able to tell _which_ log function each entry was referring to.


        Actual Results:
        Which logarithm is the right one?
