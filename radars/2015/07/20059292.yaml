    description: "Summary:\r\nApple employees are already saying \"File a radar\" and similar things, \"Radar or GTFO\" is common. There are common bugs that plague users, where Apple devs on related projects say they've never heard of the issue happening, and complain that no one filed a decent radar about the issue.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is for Apple to start rewarding devs when they file a good/helpful radar. The reward would be determined by the engineer using the radar to fix the bug etc, and would range in value based on how helpful the radar was.\r\n\r\nThe reward wouldn't have to be cash, even a voucher or something toward additional hardware/software etc. The reward could range from $0 to $1000 for example. $0 for dups with no new information, $1000 for a radar with a key piece of info that helps find and fix the bug.\r\n\r\nThis would encourage devs to spend the time to diagnose issues etc, and would vastly increase the quality of bug reports you'll receive. The fact that you're not rewarding all radars would prevent an influx of useless reports just trying to earn a reward etc."
