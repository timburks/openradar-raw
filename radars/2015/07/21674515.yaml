        Summary:
        When streaming Beats 1 and asking iTunes for the "current track" with Applescript the returned object should give the information for the playing track as shown in the iTunes playing view.  Currently the information provided is for the Beats 1 stream only.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Start streaming Beats 1 in iTunes
        2. Open Script Editor and create a new Applescript document
        3. Paste the following script in:

        tell application "iTunes" to get name of current track

        4. Run the script while Beats 1 is playing a song and the iTunes now playing view shows the song title etc.

        Expected Results:
        The result view in the Script Editor should show the track name.

        Actual Results:
        The result view in the Script Editor shows “Beats 1”
