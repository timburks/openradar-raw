    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a UIViewController subclass that I'm trying to override traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection:) on and I can't because the compiler tells me that UITraitCollection is only available in iOS 8.0 and above. It gives me a Fix-It which adds the @available attribute to the method but then the compiler gives me an error saying \"Overriding 'traitCollectionDidChange' must be as available as declaration it overrides\". I believe this is because the UITraitEnvironment protocol has no @available attribute on it in the headers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swift ios project with a deployment target of 7.0\r\n2. Try to override the traitCollectionDidChange() method of the ViewController:\r\n\r\n    @available(iOS 8.0, *)\r\n    override func traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection?) {\r\n        super.traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to compile and run the application and for the app to be able to respond to traitCollection changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompiler error: \"Overriding 'traitCollectionDidChange' must be as available as declaration it overrides.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 3 (7A152u)\r\nOSX 10.10.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAn ios project (Swift 2.0) with a deployment target of 7.0 and base SDK of 9.0"
