    description: "I'm using the MPMediaPickerController in my music apps to let the user listen to Podcasts. Prior to iOS 8.4 this worked, but now the Podcast option is not present, and my users who have paid for my app based on this functionality are not at all happy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInitialise the MPMediaPickerController with a media type of MPMediaTypePodcast, display the picker on screen, and you'll see that \"Podcasts\" are not an option.\r\n\r\n[[MPMediaPickerController alloc] initWithMediaTypes: MPMediaTypePodcast];"
