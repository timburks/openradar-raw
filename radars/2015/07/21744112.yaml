    description: "Summary:\r\nThe search bar and cancel buttons on the global (springboard) search invade the status bar's space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Swipe from the left on the home screen to show the global search screen. \r\n2. Notice the positioning of the search bar and cancel buttons on the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch bar and cancel buttons should display under the status bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search bar and cancel button invade the status bar's space on the screen. \r\n\r\nHappens in both landscape and portrait. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4293g) aka beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote: It should be noted that this only happens in a few cases. It will happen when you haven't used the global search feature in a while. If you happen to get to the search by swiping down on the home screen and then trying this, the screen lays out properly. \r\n\r\nWorkaround: If you swipe left to bring up the global search, see the UI issue, swipe back to your home screen, swipe down from the top to present search that way and then try to reproduce, it won't happen. \r\n\r\nIt's a fickle thing. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini 2, Wifi 16GB"
