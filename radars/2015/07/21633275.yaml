    description: "Summary:\r\nNeither the documentation nor the header for UIImageView specify a designated initializer.  Without knowing which initializer(s) are the designated initializer(s), it is difficult if not impossible to safely implement initialization behavior in a subclass, as explained at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13146901/what-if-a-class-has-no-documented-designated-initializer#comment28473725_19235814.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the documentation for UIImageView.\r\n2. Observe that no information about designated initializers is present.\r\n3. Open UIImageView.h\r\n4. Observe that no information about designated initializers is present.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDesignated initializer information is present both in the documentation for UIImageView and in UIImageView.h.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo information about designated initializers is in either the documentation for UIImageView or in UIImageView.h."
