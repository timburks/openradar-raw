        NOTE: This bug might belong to the Messages app, not iTunes, depending on the implementation.

        Summary:
        Copying a link from an iTunes song and pasting it to Messages doesn’t send a valid link.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open iTunes 12.2.0.145 with an account that is enrolled in Apple Music
        2. Search for “Norf Norf”
        3. Click “…” next to the search result
        4. Click “Share”
        5. Click “Copy Link”
        6. Switch to Messages
        7. Create a conversation with someone running iOS 8.4.
        8. Paste the link in an iMessage
        9. Press Send

        Expected Results:

        I expect the recipient to be able to tap the link I sent.

        Actual Results:

        The recipient receives the text “Norf Norf” but it’s not a link.

        Notes:

        - Recipients who read the message on Messages for OS X 10.10.4 (14E46) can click the link.
        - Do not reproduce this song around children; the song has explicit lyrics.
