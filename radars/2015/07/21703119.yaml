        Summary:
        The input fields for the answer to the security questions at https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage/security have a maximum length said. I tend to use random characters for answers, which I then save in a secure note in 1Password. Because the length of the field is limited, copy / pasting a long string of characters appears to work, but the form is silently removing some of the characters from the end, without letting me know.

        This results in the answers to by security questions being something else than I think they are. Preferably the form should just accept any length, but barring that it should just give an error on submit, specifying the maximum length allowed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage/security
        2. Copy and paste an answer that is longer than the allowed maximum.

        Expected Results:
        There to be no maximum, or the form to give me an error.

        Actual Results:
        The form silently accepts a different answer than I pasted.
