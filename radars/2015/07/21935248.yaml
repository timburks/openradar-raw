    description: "Summary:\r\nLocation-based reminders are not available on the iPod touch, probably because of the lack of GPS.\r\n\r\nIf I ask Siri on an iPod touch to \"remind me when I get home\", Siri first asks me what I want to be reminded about. Only after I answer that question, Siri tells me location reminders are not available on iPod.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNote again that this should be tested on an iPod touch, not an iPhone!\r\n\r\n1. Make sure your own contact has a home address and that Siri knows that contact is you (in Siri settings > My Info).\r\n2. Ask Siri \"Remind me when I get home\", without saying what you want to be reminded about.\r\n3. Siri will say \"OK, just tell me what you want to be reminded about.\" and start listening again.\r\n4. Say what to be reminded about, such as \"water the plants\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should say location-based reminders are not available on iPod touch directly as an answer to \"remind me when I get home\", without first asking me what the reason for the reminder is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri asks what I want to be reminded about, and when I give that information, it answers \"Sorry, I can't create location-based reminders on this device.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know I'm using an old iOS version, but I'm pretty sure this Siri bug is server-side, and upgrading iOS to 8.x wouldn't fix it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation, 32GB, A1421, MD720E/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'siri-reminders-text.png' was successfully uploaded."
