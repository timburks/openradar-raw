        Summary:
        Enums can have static variables shadowing their cases but not static functions.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. This code:
        enum E<F> {
        	case C
        	case D(F)
        }
        extension E {
        	static var C: () { return () }
        	static func D(_:Int) -> () {}
        }

        Expected Results:
        should compile

        Actual Results:
        but does not:
        boom.swift:7:14: error: invalid redeclaration of 'D'
                static func D(_:Int) -> () {}
                            ^
        boom.swift:3:7: note: 'D' previously declared here
                case D(F)
                     ^

        Regression:
        The static variable C is acceptable, but the static function D is not. This despite the fact that it does not actually redeclare or even shadow the case or the static func implicitly defined by the case; it just overloads it on the return type.
        The static variable C is only acceptable because E is generic, making me wonder if in fact the bug is that C compiles. But I think overloading on return type ought to be accepted here.
