    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new retina MacBooks only have a single USB port. That port is used for charging, and you can't even connect a lightning cable to it without an adapter. \r\n\r\nThis makes it even more clear how necessary wireless iOS debugging is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to build and run an iOS app on your iPhone when it is not plugged into your Mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Nearby devices show up in the device selector.\r\n2. Xcode can build for those devices.\r\n3. Xcode can wirelessly transmit the completed build to the device and run it.\r\n4. Xcode can open a wireless connection to the app for debugging.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNone of those things are currently possible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWireless debugging used to be an option in an older version of Xcode (4?) but I believe it never worked and would repeatedly crash Xcode until you turned it off.\r\n\r\nThis feature should not do that.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook running 10.10.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
