    description: "Summary:\r\nExample URL: http://jsfiddle.net/Lc3vZ/\r\n\r\nBased on http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#length-value , Safari's current behavior seems incorrect:\r\n\"In cases where the used length cannot be supported, user agents must approximate it in the actual value.\"\r\nSo Safari should be clamping it to some maximum value instead.\r\n\r\nIn OS X Firefox 29.0.1 and OS X Chrome 40.0.2214.111, the media query's condition correctly evaluates to false.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsfiddle.net/Lc3vZ/\r\n2. Note that it contains the following CSS:\r\n@media (min-width: 9999999999px) {\r\n    body {\r\n        background-color: red;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe media query's condition should not be deemed satisfied since my monitor isn't several miles wide, and the background-color in the \"Result\" pane should thus remain at its default of white.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe media query's condition somehow evaluated to true even though my viewport/screen is significantly less than 9999999999px wide. Thus, in the \"Result\" pane, the background is red.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0.7 (10600.7.12)\r\nMac OS X Yosemite\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141533\r\nAnalogous Chrome bug (which has been fixed): https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=375574\r\nOriginal Bootstrap issue: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/13632\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
