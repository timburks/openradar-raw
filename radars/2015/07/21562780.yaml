    description: "Summary:\r\nOn the Mac it is possible to attach CIFilters to CALayer instances to effect how layers look (filters, compositingFilter, backgroundFilters properties). \r\n\r\nThese properties are not operable on iOS.  With the advances in iOS device GPU, CoreImage GPU utilisation and Metal on iOS I think it is about time the power of CoreImage was brought to UIKit and CoreAnimation.\r\n\r\nPlease add integration of CoreImage into CoreAnimation for iOS 10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry using CoreImage filter properties on CALayer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHappiness and Joy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSadness.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.10, iOS 8.3 SDK\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
