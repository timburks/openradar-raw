    description: "Summary:\r\nMethods and closures that dynamically invoke a test should also get a test run button.\r\n\r\nMany third-party libraries which make creating specific types of tests easier use dynamic test invocations to work. However, it currently is less convenient to use these, since you can’t tap a test run button to run an individual test. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip attachment.\r\n2. Open Example / NWAAlertController.xcworkspace.\r\n3. Open Tests / QuickTests.swift\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be test run buttons for every closure containing an `expect` statement and for the `spec()` (line 9) and `describe()` (line 13).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo test run buttons exist.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs an added note, when you open XCTestTests.swift, you can see that `dynamicTest()` (line 56) and `dynamicTest2()` (line 61) don’t have test run buttons either. \r\nCode can also be found at https://github.com/SpacyRicochet/NWAAlertController/commit/614ba237007bcf86d9910cfeaecb3509d66cde3b"
