        Summary:
        Most of the AppleScript features available in Pages 4 are no longer present in Pages 5.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Script Editor
        2. Open the dictionary for Pages 4.3
        3. Open the dictionary for Pages 5.5.3
        4. Compare

        Expected Results:
        See all of the commands and classes available in Pages 4.3 also available in Pages 5.5.3.

        Actual Results:
        See a tiny fraction of the commands and classes available in Pages 4.3 also available in Pages 5.5.3.

        Notes:
        Many users depend upon these features to produce powerful workflows, such as importing text written in other apps into Pages with all the proper paragraph styles, making it easy to use Pages’ rich features for formatting. AppleScript support which was lost after iWork ’09 has been restored in both Numbers and Keynote—please complete the suite and restore AppleScript support for the many dedicated users of Pages who depend upon these features. :)
