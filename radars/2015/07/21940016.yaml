    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter installing Xcode 7 beta, my list of iOS Simulators in Xcode 6.x has gotten out of hand.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install Xcode 7 beta (or upgrade to the latest Xcode beta)\r\n- Launch Xcode 7 beta\r\n- Install the additional components (not sure if this is required or not)\r\n- Launch Xcode 6.x \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list of iOS Simulators should remain constant. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe list of iOS Simulators has grown to be very large and looks to include a number of duplicates. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIâ€™ve had to resort to scripts like this (https://gist.github.com/cabeca/cbaacbeb6a1cc4683aa5) to clean things up for me."
