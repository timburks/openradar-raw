    description: "Summary:\r\nTracks streamed from Apple Music (eg. For the \"For You\" tab) do not return a usable object to Applescript.  When asking iTunes for the \"current track\" with Applescript the returned object is an unknown type.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes, signed in to an account with Apple Music enabled.\r\n2. Select the \"For You\" tab in the music section.\r\n3. Browse into one of the suggested playlists and play a song.\r\n4. Either open the included script file, or open Script Editor and create a new Applescript document pasting in the following Applescript:\r\n\r\ntell application \"iTunes\" to get current track\r\ntell application \"iTunes\" to get name of current track\r\n\r\n6. Run the script (while music is still playing)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no error, and the result box at the bottom of the page should have the title of the currently playing song.  The \"current track\" object should probably be of type \"URL Track\", as tracks played from the radio are.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe script editor shows a \"Script Error\": \"iTunes got an error: Unknown object type.\" because the current track is not of a standard type (e.g. URL Track)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.2, running on any version of OS X.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe user must be signed in to an Apple Music enabled iTunes account on iTunes 12.2 to experience this issue."
