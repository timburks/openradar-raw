        Summary:
        Photos app (Mac) doesn't allow dragging thumbnails onto other apps' dock icons

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Photos, view your photos in thumbnail format
        2. Drag one of the thumbnails onto Preview's icon in the dock

        Expected Results:
        Preview opens the photo in question. (Presumably Preview would open the original file, which would be locked to prevent editing.)

        Actual Results:
        The Preview icon highlights to suggest it will accept the drag, but nothing happens when you release the mouse button. The file does not open.
