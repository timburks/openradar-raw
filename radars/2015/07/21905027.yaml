        Summary:
        The watch’s silent mode can be turned on by holding your palm over the face of the watch. This trigger can also be caused accidentally by crossing your arms.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Cross your arms so the underside of your forearm is touching the watch face.

        Expected Results:
        The silent mode should not be triggered.

        Actual Results:
        The silent mode is triggered.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        Because this trigger is accidental, you’re going to miss some important notifications. Also, because your forearm isn’t as sensitive as the palm of your hand, the taptic feedback when entering the silent mode can easily be missed.
