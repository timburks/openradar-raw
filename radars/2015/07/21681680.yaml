    description: "Summary:\r\nWith some hotspot-providers (like FON) moving over to WPA2 Enterprise-based authentication (username & password on connect) instead of web-based captive authentication, it would be useful to be able to deactivate auto-join in the iOS WiFi settings.\r\n\r\nSince those hotspot networks have wifi hotspots in lots of places, sometimes the device connects to the wifi when it is not needed nor desired. When walking or driving, it connects intermittently and connection is lost because the user has already moved away from WiFi coverage.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the only way to prevent auto-connect is to:\r\na: Turn off WiFi, which leads to inefficient Location Services\r\nb: Forget network, which forces to enter the credentials the next time\r\n\r\nBoth of these workarounds are a pain to use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a WPA2 Enterprise network with username and password\r\n2. Accept certificate (if any)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Turn off Auto-Join for the network\r\n4. Go for a walk\r\n5. Browsing happens on cellular networks\r\n6. If I really want WiFi I join the network manually with stored credentials\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Go for a walk\r\n4. Browse the web\r\n5. Notice that the phone moves from perfect 3G/4G data connectivity to a weak hotspot\r\n6. Walk some more\r\n7. Be frustrated because web pages never load\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
