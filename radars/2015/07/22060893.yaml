    description: "Summary:\r\nATS makes perfect sense and I commend Apple on taking a strong stance in favor of security, but blocking localhost requests does not make sense and only makes developer life needlessly complicated. Setting up multiple (or even just one!) SSL endpoints on a single machine development environment is a huge hassle and serves no security benefit. Please opt the localhost out of ATS blocking by default!\r\n\r\nNOTE: Yes, it is possible to opt our by adding keys to the Info.plist file, but again, this is unnecessary hassle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an app and have it contact a localhost URL. Launch app in XTractor and observe a message along these lines in the log:\r\n\r\nApp Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource load since it is insecure. Temporary exceptions can be configured via your app's Info.plist file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHTTP calls to localhost should not be blocked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource load since it is insecure. Temporary exceptions can be configured via your app's Info.plist file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9 in Xcode 7 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReproducible 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Air"
