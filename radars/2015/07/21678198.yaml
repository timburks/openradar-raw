    description: In OS X El Capitan, a feature was added which allows users to shake their mouse in order to make the cursor much larger and easier to find. However, this feature is frequently activated accidentally and eventually becomes a bit of an eyesore for those with large displays. An option should be added in System Preferences > General, or System Preferences > Mouse and System Preferences > Trackpad to disable this feature.
