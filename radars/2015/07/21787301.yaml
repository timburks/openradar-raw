    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen editing an NSPredicateEditor’s row template in interface builder (in Xcode), the left expression type won’t stay “Key Paths,” instead changing to “Constant Values” on its own.  The generated XML shows a mixture of the two:\r\n                                                <expression type=\"keyPath\">\r\n                                                    <string key=\"keyPath\">name</string>\r\n                                                </expression>\r\n                                                <expression type=\"keyPath\">\r\n                                                    <string key=\"keyPath\">address</string>\r\n                                                </expression>\r\n                                                <expression type=\"keyPath\">\r\n                                                    <string key=\"keyPath\">sign</string>\r\n                                                </expression>\r\n                                                <expression type=\"constant\">\r\n                                                    <string key=\"constantValue\">test</string>\r\n                                                </expression>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Cocoa app\r\n2. Open MainMenu.xib\r\n3. Open the window object\r\n4. Add an NSPredicateEditor\r\n5. Select the “name contains __” row template (the second one)\r\n6. Observe that the “Left Exprs” type is “Key Paths”\r\n7. Add an additional item to “Left Exprs”\r\n8. Select another file (leave IB)\r\n9. Select MainMenu.xib again\r\n10. Select the “name contains __” row template again\r\n11. Observe that the “Left Exprs” type is “Constant Values”\r\n12. Save and open MainMenu.xib in a text editor\r\n13. Observe that the expression types are mixed up, as shown above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen an expression type is selected in an NSPredicateEditor row template in IB, it stays selected and isn’t changed by adding another item.  The items all have the same type in XML, as suggested by the interface in IB.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe type wanders back to “Constant Values” on its own.  Different items have different types in the XML.  There’s no way to fix this in IB, but manually editing the XML makes it compile and run just fine.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDefinitely happens on Xcode 6.1 and 6.2 on OS X 10.9.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExample project attached was created by following the numbered steps above exactly."
