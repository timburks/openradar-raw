    description: "If I set the texture of a Sprite, save, then leave Xcode, the next time I restart this Sprite has a big Red Cross like it can't find the texture and sure enough the name of the texture is empty! Other changes (e.g. gravity) aren't persisted when I enter them. As of now, sadly, the scene/sprite editor is pretty useless.\r\n\r\nNote that in the case of the image used in the sprite it's not represented in IB (empty value in the property + red cross) but when I run the app, it's there!"
