        Summary:
        The workout app does not display heart rate information, or seem to track it at all.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Choose a workout (I chose outdoor run) in the workout app.
        2. Start the workout.

        Expected Results:
        I would expect the watch to monitor my heart rate accurately.

        Actual Results:
        The watch always says “measuring” without ever displaying an actual heart rate. It doesn’t seem to be actually capturing the rate at all either (i.e. not just a UI bug).

        Regression:
        The workout app worked properly in watch OS 1.0.1

        Notes:
        N/A.
