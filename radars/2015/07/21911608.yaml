    description: "Under Settings -> General -> Siri -> Audio Feedback, I’m seeing only two options: Always On and Control with Ring Switch. Or in other words, it doesn’t seem to be possible anymore to have your phone ring but not have Siri yakking away every time you use it. \n\nWould it be possible to bring back the previous option to suppress audio feedback unless connected through headphones or a Bluetooth device? I really never want to turn off my phone ringer unless I’m attending some sort of performance — my track record at realizing the phone is vibrating is pretty poor. But I also don’t need verbal feedback from Siri in 90% of cases, and it’s disruptive any time you’re around other people."
