        Summary:
        Keyboard highlighting of pressed characters only shows completely white boxes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use the keyboard in iOS 9b2, for example on the lock screen	

        Expected Results:
        Tapping a key should highlight it in a fashion that still allow users to recognize the key/letter/number/character they tapped. Using the pop-up picker for accented characters/special characters should actually list those characters so I can pick one.

        Actual Results:
        Tapped keys show a completely white highlight. Opening the accented character picker by tapping and holding a key doesn't show any characters to choose but only a completely white box.

        Regression:
        New in iOS 9b1, b2.
