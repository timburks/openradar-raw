    description: "Summary:\r\nI was leaving my house, taking the dogs on a walk when I did a search for \"iBird\". I knew I had purchased the app and wanted to install it when I returned to the house (it's a large download). I was able to see the \"iBird\" result from the app store and click \"View.\" Instead of going to the app store, I was presented a blank page with only the word \"Cancel\" in the top left. See screenshot.\r\n\r\nI suspect I had a weak signal from my home wifi and during the transition to LTE, I was presented with the broken, blank page. As an aside, I've noticed weird hanging of apps when this transition occurs. iOS *must* understand when a wifi is very weak and know how to seamlessly hand off to the carrier.  This has been a problem since the first iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.With a weak wifi signal, search spotlight for \"iBird\".\r\n2. While walking away from the wifi signal (or in the lab, simulate a gradually, weaker signal), click on the \"View\" button for the \"iBird\" result, to be directed to the App Store.\r\n3. In the transition from weak wifi to LTE, you will notice a blank page with a \"Cancel\" button only. (See attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device should not appear broken. Ever. \r\n\r\nIDEALLY, we should not see any interruption in the wifi to LTE transition. To the person reading this - have you ever transitioned from wifi to LTE and noticed hiccups in page loads, weird hangs in apps, etc? Fix this! At the very least, show some sort of loading cue - an icon, something. Let me know if you want further ideas in this regard. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBroken page (see attachment)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_2062.png' was successfully uploaded."
