        Summary:
        When opening the direction details in the Maps app, the details are unreadable due to white text on a bright background.
        See: http://c.inferis.org/image/0I3u0n1w0E24/IMG_0430.jpg (it's not so bad in the screenshot but hard to read on the actual phone)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the maps app
        2. enter a starting point and a destination point
        3. Select "Drive"
        4. select a route, then tap the (i) icon in the bottom right corner for details

        Expected Results:
        A readable list of steps.

        Actual Results:
        A very hard to read list of steps.
