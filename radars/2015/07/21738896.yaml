    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the introduction of Apple Music the \"isStreamable\" object, which returns true or false, was added to the iTunes Search API. \"isStreamable\" is only returned from a search query. Lookup queries, which use the content's ID do not return \"isSearchable.\" It would be useful to be able to test whether a particular song or album is streamable on Apple Music by sending a lookup query to the iTunes Search API. A search query doesn't work for this purpose because the ID of a song is not a search parameter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send a lookup query to the iTunes Search API. For example, https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=907242701\r\n2. Review resulting JSON, which do not include an \"isStreamable\" object\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected that like a search query, a lookup query would return an \"isStreamable\" object that is true or false.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, no \"isStreamable\" object is returned at all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS and OS X"
