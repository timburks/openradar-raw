    description: "Summary:\r\nAdditionally to the global indention settings (tabs vs. spaces) reachable via Xcode -> Preferences… -> Text Editing -> Indention, these settings can be configured for each file using the file inspector.\r\nHowever if a file whose indention settings differ from the default is opened in the assistant editor and Re-Indent is run, the global indention settings are used\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty Xcode project with Objective-C or C++ as the language\r\n2. Assuming you have Tabs set as your default, change the “indent using” setting to Spaces\r\n3. Open this file in the assistant editor and choose Re-Indent\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file should correctly be indented using spaces\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file is indented using the Xcode default\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nBoth Xcode 6.4 (6E35b) and Xcode 7.0 beta (7A120f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis does not apply for swift files\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
