        With the new Photos app (I’m on version 1.0 (209.52.0)), it’s not possible to easily drag photos from Photos and drop them to other apps. It is only possible — AFAICT — to drop them to the Desktop.

        1. Open Photos…
        2. Drag a photo
        3. Try to drop it in a different app, e.g. Notes, TextEdit

        Expected: Cursor turns to (+) as you hover, then a photo is added to the document when you drop
        Actually: Nope
