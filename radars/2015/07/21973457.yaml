    description: "Summary:\r\nNote: I posted this as a Stack Overflow question, but got no answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31488063/window-moves-when-clicking-control-in-title-region-with-titlebarappearstranspare\r\n\r\nSubmitted to DTS, was told it's a bug with no workaround.\r\n\r\nI have a window that uses the Yosemite titlebarAppearsTransparent and titleVisibility = NSWindowTitleHidden properties to extend the content under the title region. It is also movableByWindowBackground.\r\n\r\nThis works fine, however if I have a control, e.g. NSPopUpButton, in the titlebar region, when I click and attempt to choose a menu item, the whole window moves (while the menu stays put).\r\n\r\nHere's a demo:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ISlcnEV.gif\r\n\r\nI've tried subclassing the NSPopUpButton and overriding mouseDownCanMoveWindow, but that doesn't help (it's called, but apparently ignored).\r\n\r\nI created a demo project to reproduce the issue. It seems related to embedding the popup inside a NSSplitViewController. I can't avoid that, though, so I'm not sure what the solution might be.\r\n\r\nHere's the demo project: http://www.dejal.com/files/2015/stackoverflow/hiddentitlesissuedemo.zip\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the demo project.\r\n2. Click on either popup menu.\r\n3. Try to select an item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window doesn't move.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window will unexpectedly move.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite 10.10.4."
