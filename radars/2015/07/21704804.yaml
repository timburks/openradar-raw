    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to use the keyboard to input numbers, operators, or use the enter key to evaluate ‘=‘ I’m given an error noise and no input appears to be going to the widget.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Today View in Notification Center.\r\n2. Click on Calculator to make sure the context is on the calculator.\r\n3. Try to use keyboard input.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeyboard input is interpreted by the calculator widget without error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error noise is played and nothing happens in the calculator widget.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nKeyboard input for the calculator widget worked fine in 10.10 (tested in latest three versions).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCurrently the only work around I found was to click on each button in the widget itself with the mouse."
