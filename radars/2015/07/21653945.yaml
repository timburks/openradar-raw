    description: "When you upload a new build of your iOS app, it sits in a “processing” queue at the bottom of the pre-release builds screen until Apple finishes preparing it for the internal beta release. The problem is, you cannot add release notes to the build in this state. Yet as soon as it’s done processing, and release notes can be added, the notifications have already gone out via TestFlight. \n\nSo those internal users that are on their devices and get the notification load it up and see blank release notes.\n\nTwo possible solutions: \n\n1. Don’t automatically release the new builds. Wait until release notes have been added/saved, or the developer has explicitly pushed a “release” button for the build.\n\nor \n\n2. Allow us to add release notes while Apple is still processing the build for release."
