        Summary:
        In the Messages app, during the transition from the list of conversations to a conversation detail view, the background color of the toolbar containing the text entry field changes to a dark grey, different from the lighter grey that it normally is. This color transition is jarring during the view controller animation transition.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        + Open Messages
        + Tap on a conversation
        + Observe phenomenon during animation transition
        + Tap “< Messages” to return to conversation view
        + Observe phenomenon during animation transition
        + Tap on a conversation
        + Use an interactive back pan gesture to dismiss the conversation detail view
        + Observe phenomenon during animation transition

        Expected Results:
        Background color of text entry toolbar stays the same during animation transition

        Actual Results:
        Background color of text entry toolbar changes while the view controller transition is occurring
