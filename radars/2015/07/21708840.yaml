    description: "Summary: iCloud Photo Library introduces an unacceptable lag when previewing the last taken photo.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Open Camera app\n2) Take a photo\n3) Immediately tap the preview thumbnail in the bottom corner\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe photo should come up in full screen immediately.\n\nActual Results:\n\nI was able to count off 5 seconds before the photo appeared.\n\nNotes:\nI have iCloud Photo Library enabled and over 28,000 photos in my library. For example, adding a photo attachment to an email takes 17 full seconds to bring up the Photos selector. \n\nNone of these delays appear when iCloud Photo Library is turned off.\n\nThese delays make iCloud Photo Library an unacceptably slow service. They are much slower than Google Photos or Picturelife, for example."
