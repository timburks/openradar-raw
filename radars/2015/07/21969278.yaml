    description: "Currently Xcode/Swift just give you an error that the protocol is not implemented. It would be a huge improvement to have Xcode offer a \"fix-it\" to add the missing properties/methods to the class, automatically surrounded with a \"///MARK: <protocol name>\" marker. \r\n\r\nThis would require some compiler support to return this information along with Xcode support."
