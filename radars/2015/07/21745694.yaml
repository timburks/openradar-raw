        Summary:
        It should be possible to delete an app store entry without having to get the app approved first.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open iTunes Connect and create a new app store entry.
        2. Try to delete the entry without submitting it for review.

        Expected Results:
        It should be possible to delete an app without submitting it for review. Use cases: 1) When misspelling the bundle identifier for the app, this cannot be corrected, so you have to delete the app. 2) When teaching iOS developer courses, it is useful to let people create a demo app so they can learn how to submit an app to the store and configure in app purchases. It would be great if such a demo app entry could be deleted. Alternatively, if there is a reason for this rule that outweighs these use cases, it would be great if it would be stated in the documentation.

        Actual Results:
        The app cannot be removed. This is documented in https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/TransferringAndDeletingApps.html - "You can delete your app if there is at least one approved version of the app"
