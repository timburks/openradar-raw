        Summary:

        The calendar app on El Capitan adds an “Accept” button to calendar event notifications which is awesome. Unfortunately, they don’t clear the calendar app’s badge in the dock unless one quits and relaunches the app.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Receive a calendar invite
        2. Accept it via the notification

        Expected Results:

        No badge on calendar app.

        Actual Results:

        Badge on calendar app, which can only be cleared by quitting and relaunching the app.

        Regression: -
