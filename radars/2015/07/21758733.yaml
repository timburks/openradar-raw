    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you do custom drawing in PDFPage's and try and use a PDFView to display them, PDFView on OS X 10.11 El Capitan will not call the drawing code, and will show only blank pages!\r\n\r\nIt appears that when displaying the PDF in the PDFView, the PDFPage's draw method is never called. However, when saving the file to disk, the PDFPage's draw method is called, and the PDF saves correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project on OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\r\n2. Run it.\r\n3. The PDF should be shown in the window, but there's only a blank page.\r\n4. Hit the \"Save PDF to Disk\" button in the window.\r\n5. Use the Save Panel to save the file to disk.\r\n6. Open it and see that the PDF is correctly printed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPDFView should display the PDF correctly, with the text drawn in it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPDFView shows only a blank page. Setting a breakpoint in the PDFPage's draw method shows that the method is never called when displaying in the PDFView, but IS called when writing the PDF document to the disk.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.11 beta 3, Xcode 7.0 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in OS X 10.11 El Capitan, but NOT in OS X 10.10 or any previous version of OS X.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nExample project is available here: http://qapps.s3.amazonaws.com/PDFDrawingBug.zip"
