        Summary:

        I would assume that “Add to Up Next” and “Play Next” would work the same as in iTunes, i.e., add to the _end_ of the current playlist and add after the current song respectively. (The popover notification icons show a similar meaning.)

        However, both add new songs after the current song (i.e., Play Next).

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Start to play an album
        2. Find another album (in fact it works with the same one too) and “Add to Up Next”

        Expected Results:

        Album added _after_ the current _album_

        Actual Results:

        Album added after the current _song_.

        Regression:

        This functionality is new in iOS 8.4.

        Notes:

        This also appears to happen in iOS 9b2 (iPad 3). There are a couple of ways to “Add to Up Next.” They all appear to function identically.
