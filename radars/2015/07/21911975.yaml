    description: "When importing a .mom file into Xcode, the \"Ordered\" option is always set to False on the newly created relationships between Entities, even if they were True in the original model.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode\r\n\r\n2. Create a new iOS project with CoreData\r\n\r\n3. In the CoreData editor, create a new entity with an ORDERED to-many relationship to another entity\r\n\r\n4. Archive the app\r\n\r\n5. From the app's archive, extract the .mom file\r\n\r\n6. Create a new model version, and (optionally) clear its contents for clarity\r\n\r\n7. With the CoreData Model selected in Xcode, choose Edit -> Import and select the .mom file you extracted earlier\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll of the entities should be recreated and the \"ordered\" field value should be maintained.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll of the entities were recreated, EXCEPT the \"ordered\" field was not maintained.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.4 (6E3B5) / 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAside from the obvious ramifications of assuming un-ordered data is ordered, this causes the hash-values to be different from previous versions, which causes the app to crash when migrating from a previous model-version.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it causes newly updated apps to crash upon opening with a CoreData error.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.4, building for iOS 8."
