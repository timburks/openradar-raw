    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, you’ll get an e-mail thread that has a lot of traffic with replies—jokes, animated Gifs, etc. But you’re trying to work. But you’re also waiting for a work e-mail, so you want to leave Mail open. It would be nice to be able to mute a thread, like you can in Gmail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be included on a verbose e-mail thread.\r\n2. Open Mail and right-click on the thread in your Inbox.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can click “Mute,” and future replies to this thread will not trigger notifications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no mute button. Replies coming in generate notifications."
