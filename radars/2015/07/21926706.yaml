        Summary:
        If you have a song playing, and there’s no way to add a shuffled playlist to Up Next. You can shuffle a playlist, which stops playback, or you can add the playlist to Up Next, which doesn’t shuffle it. Add a “…” button for Shuffle, or a long press option, that would allow this.
