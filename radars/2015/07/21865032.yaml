    description: "In order to reduce the number of bot integrations when commits occur in bursts, allow developers to specify a quiet period for on-commit bot integrations. e.g. Wait 10 minutes after a commit before starting an integration. This should apply to on-commit integrations as well as REST-triggered integrations. It should not apply to developer-triggered integrations through Xcode.\r\n\r\nMore about quiet periods: http://jenkins-ci.org/content/quiet-period-feature"
