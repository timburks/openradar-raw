        Summary:
        When jumping to the end of a line that doesn’t fit, while viewing a diff before a commit, hitting ⌘→ will scroll the left pane to the end of the line, but scroll the right pane to the beginning, and vise-versa

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Commit changes made
        2. View a file with text that is wider than the viewport on both sides of the diff view
        3. Select the line that extends beyond the view
        4. Hit ⌘→
        5. Hit ⌘←

        Expected Results:
        After step 4, the left and right panes are both scrolled to the end of their lines
        After step 5, both are scrolled to the beginning

        Actual Results:
        After step 4, the left view is scrolled to the end, but the right view hasn’t moved
        After step 5, the left view is scrolled to the beginning, but the right view is scrolled to the end
