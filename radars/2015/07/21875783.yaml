        Summary:
        When using a project that has never been used with Xcode 7 previously, the BITCODE_ENABLED flag is enabled by default. This causes problems when a workspace utilizes another project managed by a different source than the developer has access to. This becomes a problem when dynamic frameworks built in a workspace’s sub-projects you don’t manage also import another static library or framework which hasn’t been built for bitcode. This scenario prevents any of the projects from being built until bitcode is turned off on all projects in the workspace. This is much more difficult than it would appear when several projects in a workspace are managed by different teams who may or may not be using Xcode 7 and will require a change in their project just to get yours to compile.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open a workspace with several subprojects that have many framework/library dependencies with Xcode 7, one of which having a library or framework that hasn’t been built with bitcode.

        Expected Results:
        The project should be able to be built without modification.

        Actual Results:
        The build fails due to a static library not being built using bitcode. You must manually turn off bitcode on all projects opened with Xcode 7 in order to get all of the dependencies of your dynamic framework to compile.

        Regression:
        All builds with Xcode 7
