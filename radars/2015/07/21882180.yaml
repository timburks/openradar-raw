    description: "Summary:\nWhen trying to run an app on a real device (issue does not occur on any iOS Simulator), Xcode will say \"Running on [Device Name]\", but the app will never open on the device. When you click the Stop button, nothing stops. Unplugging the device results in the device name still appearing in the device dropdown. The only way to get back to a state that has the Run button is to force quit Xcode. Running the app generally works the next time you run Xcode, but eventually after a couple of times of running, the hang will occur again.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Click the Run button with a real device (tested with iPhone 6 (iOS 8.3) and iPhone 6+ (iOS 8.4)\n2. Occasionally, the app will never open automatically on the iPhone\n3. Try to press Stop - nothing happens\n4. Force quit Xcode because nothing else works\n\nExpected Results:\nI expect Xcode to never hang and to always automatically open the app I'm trying to run on the device I have plugged in.\n\nActual Results:\nXcode does the described behavior. \n\nRegression:\nI don't remember this ever occurring on Xcode 6.3, but I'm not 100% positive."
