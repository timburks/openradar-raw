    description: "Summary:\nIf you drag (in this instance), a .ttf file from the Standard Explorer, to the Copy Bundle Resources phase of a Today Extension. It add itself correctly. However, it is not actually copied into the Extension Bundle and is unavailable for use. The path to the file is also completely incorrect and does not exist there. \n\nInstead, if you click on the file you would like to add to the Extension Bundle, and check the box on the Target Memberships pane, it is also added to the Copy Bundle Resources phase, only the file path is different.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Drag .ttf from Standard Explorer into Copy Bundle Resources Phase, verify that it appears with the incorrect path\n2. Build app.\n3. .ttf not found\n4. Select .ttf from Standard Explorer and check box under Target Memberships\n5. Check Copy Bundle Resources Phase, verify that it appears with the correct path\n\nExpected Results:\nBoth should work\n\nActual Results:\nOnly the latter works\n\nRegression:\nI wish I could, sorry.\n\nNotes:\nHere is an image illustrating the incorrect path (top), and the correct path (bottom) http://i.imgur.com/WTPxsBD.png"
