    description: "Summary:\nWhen doing a custom .CurrentContext animation inside a container view (from a storyboard) the presentation transition adds the presented view controller's view (fromView) to a `UITransitionView`. \n\nWhen dismissing the presented view controller the toView should be added to the `UITransitionView`, which is cleaned up after the transition finishes. During this cleanup the toView is taken from the `UITransitionView` and added back at the wrong place in the view hierarchy.\n\nIt should be added back as a subview of the container view (from which it came), instead it appears to be added as a subview of the rootViewController's transitionView.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Have a view controller with a custom .CurrentContext transition\n2. Present the view controller using the custom transition\n3. Dismiss the view controller\n\nExpected Results:\nThe view hierarchy to be restored to the state it was in before the presentation (or the visual equivalent of that).\n\nActual Results:\nThe view hierarchy ends up with the toView at the wrong place."
