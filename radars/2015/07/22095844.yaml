        This morning, I was late for a meeting and forgot to unlock my watch after putting it on my wrist.

        After the meeting, I had breakfast and started working.

        At lunch, I looked at my wrist and realized that the watch was locked. I also realized that I hadn’t gotten any notifications for almost five hours; including reminders to stand at 50 minutes past the hour.

        That one moment when waking up led to me sitting on my ass for far too much time. Luckily, I didn’t have any additional appointments in the morning or I would have missed those, too.

        The Apple Watch knows that it’s locked. It also knows that I’m wearing it. Why can’t it remind me that it’s locked and not presenting notifications?
