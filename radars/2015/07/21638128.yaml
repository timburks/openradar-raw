    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iCloud Music Library is enabled, some purchased tracks will not download, producing the error: \"TRACK cannot be downloaded because it was not purchased with your Apple ID.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn the iPhone: One Apple ID that I've used for all my purchases since the iTMS debuted. Subscribed to Apple Music.\r\n\r\nOne different Apple ID signed in to iCloud.\r\n\r\nNothing signed in on my iPhone. Nothing synced to my iPhone.\r\n\r\nGo into the Music app, say I'm already subscribed to Apple Music, sign in to Apple Music with my first Apple ID.\r\n\r\n\"My music\" shows me all my purchased iTunes tracks. I can play them all.\r\n\r\nGo into Settings, toggle \"iCloud Music Library\" on. Now all my non-purchased tracks show up. Try to play purchased tracks, about half of them now tell me I did not purchase them with my Apple ID and refuse to play.\r\n\r\nGo into the iTunes Store app, and go to \"purchases\", I can download the track and play it. But as soon as I remove the download, it goes back to telling me I never purchased it.\r\n\r\nOn the Mac:\r\n\r\nSame as above, but the iTunes Store will not allow me to download the tracks either, and will produce the same error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll purchased iTMS tracks should play when iCloud Music Library is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome purchased tracks fail to play and produce an error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.2.0.145\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8.4\r\nOS X 10.10.4, iTunes 12.2"
