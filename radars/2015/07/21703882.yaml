    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an iOS app that features a WKWebView containing a contenteditable element. When using an external bluetooth keyboard the key combination of CMD+Right Arrow moves the caret to the end of the line. I’d expect CMD+Left Arrow to move the caret to the start, in a similar way that ALT+Left and ALT+Right move the caret to the start/end of words, respectively.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI’ve a sample project at https://github.com/BipSync/ios-wkwebview-contenteditable/releases/tag/1.0.0. Run the project, attach an external bluetooth keyboard to the iOS device, and tap the text on screen somewhere in the middle of the sentence so the caret appears. Press CMD+Right arrow and observe the caret move to the end of the line. Press CMD+Left and observe the caret stay in position.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen pressing CMD+Left the caret moves to the beginning of the line it is positioned on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe caret remains at its current position. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI’ve reproduced this on both an iPad mini 2 running iOS 8.3 and an iPhone 5 running 8.4. This may be a regression from earlier versions of iOS, but definitely occurs on 8.2+.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project: https://github.com/BipSync/ios-wkwebview-contenteditable/releases/tag/1.0.0\r\n\r\nIf someone’s looking at this, might I please ask that they take a look at rdar://19713813 too, which is along the same lines (can’t select text when holding shift while performing the above keystrokes). Thanks!"
