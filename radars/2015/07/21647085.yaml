    description: "Summary:\r\nContextual \"...\" menus in Apple Music are very inconsistent between sections, and options you expect (such as \"Add to My Music\") do not show when you expect them to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Search for an Artist (eg. \"David Bowie\")\r\n3. Find and recognise a great album in the \"Albums\" section of the results\r\n4. Hover over the album\r\n5. Click the \"...\" button\r\n6. Note that only the \"Share\" option is displayed (Image1)\r\n7. Click the album to view in full\r\n8. Click the \"...\" button\r\n9. Note that you now have more options, including adding the album to your library (Image2)\r\n10. Click the \"<\" arrow to go back to the search results\r\n11. Click the same \"...\" button as in step 5\r\n12. Note that it now contains *even more* options, including adding to My Music and \"Playing Next\". (Image3)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contextual \"...\" menu should always show the same options for an album, no matter where in Apple Music you click it. It should always give you the option to add the album to My Music and give the option to \"Play Next\" if music is currently playing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe contextual \"...\" menu displays vastly different options depending on the screen you click it\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.2.0.145 / OS X 10.10.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Image1.png', 'Image2.png' and 'Image3.png' were successfully uploaded."
