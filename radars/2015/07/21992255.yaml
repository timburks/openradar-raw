        Iâ€™m using the boilerplate code below to determine the name of the currently-connected WiFi network. As of beta 4, CNCopySupportedInterfaces() always seems to return nil.

                if let ifs = CNCopySupportedInterfaces() {
                    for ifnam in ifs as Array {
                        if let info = CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo(ifnam as! String) {
                            let infoDict = info as NSDictionary
                            if infoDict.count > 0 {
                                currentNetwork = infoDict[kCNNetworkInfoKeySSID as String] as? String
                                return
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }

        I have tried NEHotspotHelper.supportedNetworkInterfaces() instead, but this always returns an empty array. (I have not added any additional entitlements.)
