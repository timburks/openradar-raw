        I’ve had trouble getting wireless sync working in the past, but for the last couple of months it has been pretty reliable. Alas, with the new update of iTunes, it’s back to not working.

        The iPad appears in iTunes when connected with a cable and syncs / backs up just fine. But even with “Sync with this iPad over Wi-Fi” checked, the iPad disappears from the iTunes UI as soon as the cable is pulled.

        I have tried unchecking the “Sync with this iPad over Wi-Fi” box, syncing, rechecking the box, and syncing again, but it doesn’t make any difference.
