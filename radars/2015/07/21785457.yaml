    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode generates by default NSManagedObject subclasses and marks all properties as Optionals.\r\ne.g.\r\nvar a: String?\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to have ability to mark it as optional value so we it could avoid removing those question marks manually every time when subclass is generated - Since we've got nonnull and nullable in Objective-C it could be also implemented for Objective-C language.\r\n\r\nI would like to have generator which gives me extension looking like following:\r\n\r\nextension Car {\r\n    var wheelCount: NSNumber\r\n    var doorCount: NSNumber\r\n    var driver: Driver?\r\n}\r\n\r\nI don't know if this should be reported in another ticket but setting default value for attribute also does not cause that property will be non-optional.\r\n\r\nI would like to set default value of wheelCount to 4 and it should cause that wheelCount will not be optional too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create project with Core Data\r\n2. Add entity with some attributes\r\n3. Generate class for the entity\r\n4. See that properties are Optionals.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. As a developer I would like to have ability to mark which properties are optionals and which are not. \r\n2. I also would like to set default value for property which should also mean that the property will be non-optional.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExtension of entity class is generated with optional properties.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 3, Project with deployment target set to 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
