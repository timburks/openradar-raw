    description: "The behavior of Spotlight on iOS (including on the simulator) is quite opaque. When setting up CoreSpotlight in an app, it makes it hard to guess why a specific item shows up or not. There should be a way to trace what Spotlight is up to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Run an app with CSSearchableItems in the Simulator\r\n* Switch to spotlight and tap a test search\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDebug information, explaining why items were included or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMagical UI, containing the expected items, or maybe not. But to find out why, our only method is to try and err.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdditionally, I should say that the CSSearchableItemAttributeSet documentation lacks some details. I filed radar 22029715 on this documentation issue."
