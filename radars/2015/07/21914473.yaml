    description: "Summary:\r\nOn an iPod touch 5, if I tell Siri the word \"silence\", it gives me the following answer:\r\n\"You can put your iPod on vibrate mode using the ringer switch, or on silent mode in Settings > Sounds\".\r\n\r\nHowever, the iPod touch has neither a vibrator nor a ringer switch, and if I go to Settings > Sounds, I can't find anything about a silent mode. Clearly this answer is only applicable to the iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iPod touch, hold down home button to activate Siri\r\n2. Say the word \"Silence\", and nothing else\r\n3. Wait for Siri to answer\r\n\r\nI have reproduced this problem with Siri set to either English (United States) or Spanish (Mexico) (using the word \"Silencio\" in the latter case).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI tried saying \"Silence\" while experimenting with humorous Siri queries, thinking maybe she would get angry that I'm telling her to shut up. One option would be to add such a humorous reply.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps a reasonable (non-humorous) result would be to lower the volume to 0%, or give instructions on how to do it (especially if changing the volume would be impossible without client-side iOS changes, or if it's undesirable to let Siri change the volume).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri gives me iPhone-specific instructions about activating vibration and using the ringer switch, which are not applicable to the iPod touch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know I'm using an old iOS version, but I'm pretty sure this Siri bug is server-side, and upgrading iOS wouldn't fix it. I won't bore you with the reasons why I didn't upgrade yet.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation, 32GB, A1421, MD720E/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'siri-silence.png' was successfully uploaded."
