    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen there are few Xcodes on a computer the simulator names might be the same if e.g. you've got few Xcode 7 betas. Then Xcode instead of displaying \"iPhone 5s (8.4)\" it is displaying \"iPhone 5s (<LONG UDID HERE>)\". This is very annoying because when simulators are the same but Xcode builds differs only I don't know which simulator is which one and I had to change name of them manually or delete them. This cost some time and is very slow process. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if Xcode will still print OS version of simulator even if UDID is added to the end of a name. This will save developer's time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install few Xcodes and simulators for these Xcodes.\r\n2. Open some project.\r\n3. See there is many simulators and there is no info about system version, just name + UDID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be OS version always displayed next to the simulator model.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no OS version printed in such case.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7 beta 4, OS X 10.10.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
