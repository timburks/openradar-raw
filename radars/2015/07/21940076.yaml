    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a text label has a quote right next to parenthesis, there will be a distinct width, when the quoted text will jump back and forth between current and next line.\r\n\r\nIt also messes up UILabel and -[NSString boundingRectWithSize...] method. The method returns correct width, but UILabel fails to fit that string in that calculated width.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake an UILabel in Xcode with text:\r\nTest text that wouldn't \"wrap\" (if near parenthesis)\r\n\r\nFont: Helvetica Neue Light, 15pt\r\nNumber of lines: 0\r\n\r\nText will fail to correctly fit in a label width around 200px\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText should fit into two lines without jumping back and forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt looks like UILabel wouldn't break quote+space+parenthesis combination.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, OS X 10.10.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBug can be seen in both on iOS and OS X.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, Macbook Pro Retina 13''"
