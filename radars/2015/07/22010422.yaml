    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a built-in diagnostics mode in our production code that monitors all memory allocations and deallocations to help identify potential sources of leaks and heap corruption.  In iOS 8 this worked correctly, but in iOS 9, beta 3 and later, this is no longer working due to changes to how the Apple SDKs are linked.  It appears that the Apple SDKs no longer use the import table to resolve the addresses of system calls, and this renders our diagnostics code useless.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached \"DocTest\" app.\r\n2. Run the app on an iOS 8 device, and observe the console log output.\r\n3. Run the app on an iOS 9 device (beta 3 or later), and observe the console log output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe console output should show all memory allocations/deallocations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe console output on the iOS 8 device shows all allocations/deallocations, from all sources including Apple SDKs.  On iOS 9 we only see a very small subset.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2 WiFi running iOS 8.4,  iPad Air 2 running iOS 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DocTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
