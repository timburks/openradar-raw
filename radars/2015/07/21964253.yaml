        Summary:
        Communication between Apple watch and iPhone fails. Symptoms are Siri can’t communicate with phone, all other apps that require communication with phone fail (i.e. messages, mail, weather, and 3rd party apps).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Install betas on iPhone and Apple Watch.

        Expected Results:
        Expect Apple Watch to be able to communicate reliably with iPhone.

        Actual Results:
        Communication fails regularly, with apps not working or otherwise falling to acquire data they need from the phone.

        Regression:
        Seems this may be related to BT communication (see attached logs).

        Notes:
        See attached logs.

        Notice Jul 23 10:33:30 when companion proxy fails. then at 10:33:38 we see the BTLEServer fail with Received unexpected end of input stream on pipe <CBScalablePipe, followed by failure of WPDContinuity etc.

        Obviously I’m just guessing at causes here. In any case, the symptoms are consistent: Watch-Phone communication fails and is unreliable.
