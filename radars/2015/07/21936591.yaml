    description: "Summary:\r\nI am writing an app containing a content blocker extension.  Xcode is failing to upload my app because the NSExtensionPointIdentifier in my content blocker (com.apple.Safari.content-blocker) is invalid.  However, this is the correct identifier as provided by the Xcode template for that build target.\r\n\r\nThis bug prevents me from uploading my app for TestFlight beta testing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download and open the attached Xcode project.  You may need to change the bundle identifiers and set up a testing app in iTunes Connect so you can upload the app.\r\n2. Select an iOS device and choose Product > Archive.\r\n3. After this completes, try uploading the app from the Organizer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe archive should meet criteria for adding the binary to iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUpload fails with the following error:\r\nERROR ITMS-90362: \"Invalid Info.plist value. The value for the key 'NSExtensionPointIdentifier' in bundle blocker.app/PlugIns/blocker-extension.appex is invalid.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 beta 4 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVersion 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'blocker.zip' was successfully uploaded."
