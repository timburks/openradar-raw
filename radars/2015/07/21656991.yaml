        Summary:
        Tapping on the UIActionSheet title view of a Now Playing song seems like it should open the song in the user’s music library, but with the introduction of Apple Music, the Now Playing song may not be a part of the user’s library. Tapping this view opens the “My Music” tab, and pushes an empty view controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Play a song from Apple Music that is not in your music library.
        2. Tap the “…” on the bottom right of the Now Playing view.
        3. Tap the view at the top of the UIActionSheet that has the album art, song name, artist, and album name.

        Expected Results:
        I expected to see this song (or the album containing it) on an Apple Music page, or nothing.

        Actual Results:
        A view that says Unknown Album / Unknown Artist is shown.
