    description: "Summary:\r\nThe way of the future for music consumption is subscription based rather than purchased individual tracks. This is best evidenced by the addition of Apple Music and it's competition such as Spotify, RDIO etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, this presents a problem for third party developers that wish to be able to play back songs for a user that has a valid Apple Music subscription or has songs stored in the iCloud Music Library. \r\n\r\nSince all of the tracks in Apple Music / iCloud Music Library are DRM encumbered, developers of music related apps and their customers will suffer because there is no API available that allows for playback of these tracks.\r\n\r\nApple should provide and enforce a set of App Store review guidelines, and expose an API that would allow developers to play back songs from a user's Apple Music / iCloud Music library.\r\n\r\nSpotify provides an API for approved apps and developers. It would be great for Apple customers and app developers if Apple were to offer an equivalent set of functionality to the developers and customers that have bought into the Apple Music ecosystem instead of the competition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go into the Music app\r\n2. Save an Apple Music track for offline playback.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Go into a third party app - such as Anytune\r\n4. Anytune will show the track is present\r\n5. Tap the song - Anytune imports the song and allows the customer to play it back like any other song in their library\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Go into a third party app - such as Anytune\r\n4. Anytune will show the track is present, but it is grey'ed out\r\n5. Tap the song - Anytune informs the customer that the track cannot be played back due to DRM.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 / OS-X 10.4 / iTunes 12.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote: Access through the MPMusicPlayer is not sufficient. Many applications require direct access to the audio samples for processing purposes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone/iPad/Mac user with Apple Music subscription\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDuplicate of\r\n21870955"
