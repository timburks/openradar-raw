    description: "Issue category: Documents & Data\r\n\r\nDetailed Description:\r\nWhen sharing a document from any of the developer iWork apps, the apps will freeze or crash when attempted.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open any one of the developer iWork apps on iOS 8.\r\n2. Tap the share icon at the top of the screen.\r\n3. Tap \"Send a Copy\" or \"Open in Another App\"\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n[Send a Copy]\r\n\r\nWhen tapping \"Send a Copy\", a prompt to \"Select a Document\" appears. Upon selecting a document and a share method, a screen telling to \"Choose a Format\" pops up. After selecting one of the four available options, another screen appears, dedicated to the share method previously chosen.\r\n\r\n[Open in Another App]\r\n\r\nWhen tapping \"Open in Another App\", a prompt to \"Select a Document\" appears. Upon selecting a document and a share method, a screen telling to \"Choose a Format\" pops up. After selecting one of the four available options, a third-party app proceeds to open and acts appropriately.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n[Send a Copy]\r\n\r\nWhen tapping \"Send a Copy\", a prompt to \"Select a Document\" appears as usual; however, when selecting a document and a share method, the share sheet remains active and restricts the access of choosing a format.\r\n\r\nIf anywhere outside the sheet is tapped, the \"Choose a Format\" screen is viewable, but cannot be interacted or exited with.\r\n\r\n[Open in Another App]\r\n\r\nWhen tapping \"Open in Another App\", a prompt to \"Select a Document\" appears, along with the share sheet. Tapping anywhere on the screen, whether it be on the share sheet or not crashes the app.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n• Tested on iPhone 5c, both iOS 8 beta 1 and 2.\r\n• Sharing from within the document does not resolve the issue."
