    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the parent (iPhone) app has Bitcode disabled, it becomes impossible to archive the app for production distribution. (in our case, we have MANY 3rd-party dependencies which don't yet support Bitcode and probably won't for a long time so we need to disable it for now). As you can't disable Bitcode in watchOS 2, this completely blocks an iPhone app with a bundled watchOS 2 app from being able to archive (and thus deploy to the App Store) if the parent has BitCode disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assume a iPhone project with a watchOS 2 app target, and the necessary provisioning setup (in our case these are Enterprise signed profiles, unsure if that matters at present)\r\n2. Set Bitcode Enabled to \"NO\" in the iPhone app target settings\r\n3. Attempt to archive the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should be archived with valid provisioning and able to be distributed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app fails to archive with the following error:\r\nerror: Embedded binary is not signed with the same certificate as the parent app. Verify the embedded binary target's code sign settings match the parent app's.  \r\n  Embedded Binary Signing Certificate: Not Code Signed  \r\n  Parent App Signing Certificate: iPhone Distribution: <signing certificate goes here>\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2 (beta 4)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis exact issue has also been reported by others on the Apple Developer Forums: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/10392\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7 (beta 4), Yosemite 10.10.4 (this is presumably still happening on El Capitan however)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
