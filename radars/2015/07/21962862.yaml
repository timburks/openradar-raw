    description: "Summary:\r\nThe 'lockfile' binary, which normally lives in '/usr/bin' has gone missing in 10.11 Beta 4.\r\n\r\nThis binary was extremely useful for writing bash scripts that wouldn't stomp on each other while running as a service. Was this binary removed intentionally? If so, can we expect it to stay gone?\r\n\r\n It would be super useful to have this functionality and I am certain it will break scripts for many folks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to /usr/bin\r\n2. Observe that the lockfile binary is missing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Go to /usr/bin\r\n2. Celebrate and use the lockfile binary\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Go to /usr/bin\r\n2. Despair over the missing lockfile binary and consider making your own janky lockfile solution for scripts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 Beta 15A226f\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is no known workaround at this time, other than implementing your own lockfile solution from scratch (ewwww)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is persistent on 10.11 beta 15A226f\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
