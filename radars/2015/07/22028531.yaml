        Summary:
        Imageset folders for manually added xcassets images are not and cannot be committed to Git using Xcode Source Control.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new iOS Single View Application project with a Git repository.
        2. Open 'Assets.xcassets' and add a new graphics file by dragging it from the Finder into the assets list (the problem doesn't seem to be file-type specific - I used a simple test.png image)
        3. Click "Source Control > Commit"
        4. The file indicator for the xcassets file indicates 'partial' (not checked / unchecked) by default. Check the file view - this indicates that the actual imageset files will not be committed.
        5. Commit the changes.

        Expected Results:
        - xcassets with imageset and test.png files committed.

        Actual Results:
        - Only the Contents.json metadata is committed, not the actual image file.
        - If you manually check the 'xcassets' or the 'test.imageset' file, this causes an error "The working copy “...” failed to add files. // Failed to read file into stream: Is a directory (-1)"

        Regression:
        Worked without problems in Xcode 6.3.2
