    description: "Try running this function in a context that allows step-by-step debugging and inspect the value of “state” before and after the assignment of .Two. Aftwards, the debugger just shows:\n\nstate\tMinimalCase.Goo\t<invalid> (0x90)\t<invalid> (0x90)\n\nAs near as I can tell, the enum value is in fact OK. It’s just that the debugger can’t display it.\n\nInterestingly, the debugger’s choking on this enum seems to involve the .Three case; if you remove that from the enum definition, then the debugger shows .Two correctly.\n\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc flubber()\n{\n    enum Goo {\n        case One\n        case Two(NSArray)\n        case Three(NSArray)\n    }\n    \n    var state = Goo.One\n    state = .Two(NSArray())\n}"
