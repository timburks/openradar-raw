    description: 'Using Siri to dictate and send text messages is great. Itâ€™s so great that I often find myself wanting the inverse: transcribing voicemails. If I could open my voicemails as a chat-(or mail)-like view, it would be amazing. Even better if the text hyperlinked to the relevant time in the audio. Currently getting this functionality requires either use of shady-seeming apps or a Google Voice number.'
