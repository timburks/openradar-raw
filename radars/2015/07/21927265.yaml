        Summary:
        Weird inconsistency in how enum cases are handled.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. This code:
        enum A {
        	indirect case C()
        }


        Expected Results:
        should show an error just like this code does:
        enum A {
        	indirect case C
        }

        error: enum case 'C' without associated value cannot be 'indirect'
                indirect case C
                ^


        Actual Results:
        but totally doesn’t.


        Regression:
        As noted, leaving off the parens nets you the error.


        Notes:
        This suggests that the compiler doesn’t think of the no-paren case as actually having an associated value of type (), which is semantically alarming.
