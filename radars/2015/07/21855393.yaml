        Iâ€™m running Xcode 6.4 on El Capitan 10.11 Beta (15A216g).

        I also have Xcode Version 7.0 beta 3 (7A152u) installed.

        At some recent point, Xcode 6.4 has begun showing 2 versions of iOS 8.4 simulators for each device type. This has caused the Schemes menu to be filled with duplicate choices, which causes it to show GUIDs next to each choice, becoming difficult to read. (This also means the Schemes menu disappears entirely from the toolbar at certain widths of the Xcode window.)
