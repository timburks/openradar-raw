        Summary:
        HealthKit is missing a way of getting localized, human readable strings of object types.

        HKObjectType are distinguished from each other by an identifier property. This identifier property can be one of many constants in HKTypeIdentifiers.h. There are cases where these types have to be represented in the UI. Right now, I am maintaining a huge dictionary of type identifiers to readable strings. (which I am having a hard time localizing since they can get very domain specific)

        Ideally, making -[HKObjectType hk_localizedName] public would solve this problem by giving developers a way of representing HKObjectTypes in UI.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a HKObjectType using one of the type identifiers from HKTypeIdentifiers.h.
        Try to get a readable representation of this type.
        	(i.e. HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietaryVitaminB12 -> Vitamin B12)

        Expected Results:
        A localized, readable representation of the HKObjectType.

        Actual Results:
        No localized, readable representation of the HKObjectType.

        Regression:
        Occurs on all versions of HealthKit shipped to dateâ€”including the latest build of iOS 9.
