    description: "Summary:\r\nThe animation returning from the \"slide right to show calories\" gesture does not match scrolling the entire view up and down. Date numbers scroll up or down, but the rings remain vertically locked until their animation back has completed.\r\n\r\nAttached movie shows how to reporduce, the snapshot shows the brief state where the dates overlap the rings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In month view of Activity iPhone app\r\n2. Use left-to-right gesture to compress rings into \"activity-calorie mode\"\r\n3. Lift finger, rings will start to animate back to normal state, moving left\r\n4. Swipe up or down before ring animation completes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe illusion that dates and rings are cohesive units should be maintained. The rings should animate up and down, matching and tracking the date number scrolling, even if they are still \"expanding\" back from their compressed state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe rings and their corresponding dates animate in different directions. As snapshot attached shows, date numbers can cover the rings. The glitch is brief, but very noticable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4293g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot beta, has always happened\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'activity animation sync.mov' and 'activity animation snapshot.png' were successfully uploaded."
