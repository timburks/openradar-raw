        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        Setting layoutMarginsRelativeArrangement or layoutMargins on a UIStackView in IB doesn’t actually have any effect.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.

        1. Add a UIStackView to a storyboard
        2. Check the “Layout Margins Relative” check box and add some custom Layout Margins using the attributes and size inspectors.
        3. Pop a breakpoint in the appropriate viewDidLoad.
        4. Inspect the layoutMargins and layoutMarginsRelativeArrangement properties of the stack view in LLDB

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        That the properties have been correctly populated from the storyboard

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        Layout margins is {0,0,0,0} (which is weird in itself, right? - should be {8,8,8,8}).
        Layout margins relative is false.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.

        If you set these properties in code then they are respected by the AL engine.
