        Summary:
        It would be great to be able to do split screen with the desktop. There are times where it’s super useful to have a desktop full of smaller windows with one application “pinned” to the side. Examples would be keeping Calendar or Twitter pinned to the side of the screen while having Messages, Adium, or a finder window floating in the space next to it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        While attempting to use split screen with one application, try to use the desktop as the second.

        Expected Results:
        Usable area where Finder windows and other applications can float about while having one application in split screen mode locked to just part of the screen.

        Actual Results:
        Split screen fails to activate and instead opens up the application in full screen mode.
