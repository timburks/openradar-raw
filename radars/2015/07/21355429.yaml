    description: "Summary:\r\nThe watch is supposed to maintain a basic connection via Wifi if the paired phone is out of reach. This does not work if the phone uses a static IP address with the current Wifi network. It will however start working if the network is \"forgotten\", then newly connected using DHCP, at which point the watch will start using that network. The phone can then get it's static address back, and the connection will continue to work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone to a Wifi with static IP address\r\n2. Pair Apple Watch\r\n3. Switch off Bluetooth on iPhone, or walk out of reach with the watch\r\n4. connection is lost, no calls, no iMessage\r\n5. Turn Bluetooth back on, forget and reconfigure network on iPhone using DHCP\r\n6. Allow a few seconds to propagate the info to the watch, then repeat from step 3\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple Watch should probe the network for a DHCP service regardless of whether or not the iPhone uses a static IP address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple Watch will not even show up with it's MAC address on the Wifi network if the iPhone uses a static IP address.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1.0.1 (12S632)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug reminds me of the defective VPN connection we had in earlier iOS 8 and Yosemite versions that also didn't work with static IP addresses."
