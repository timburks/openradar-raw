    description: "Summary:\r\nLoad my example website at http://worldtvnews.altervista.org/index-webapp.html which has been set in meta as web-app-capable = yes. Bookmark the web app to your homescreen. If you rotate your device while the app is launched, eventually the screen will get smaller and then app will crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In iOS Safari go to http://worldtvnews.altervista.org/index-webapp.html\r\n2. Go to the share menu and save the web app to your homescreen\r\n3. Open the web app from your homescreen.\r\n4. Rotate your iOS device multiple times between landscape and portrait mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe web app should rotate as many times as you want and the design should stay the same and not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter several rotates, the web design zooms out more and more and then crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 and iOS 9 public beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried changing the web app to not have any javascript or anything extraneous like that, and it still crashes. If you set the meta web-app-capable as NO, then it doesn't crash because it's not a full screen web app.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 8.4, iPad Air 2 iOS 9 public beta, iOS simulator (all devices) 8.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'webapp-crashlog.txt' was successfully uploaded."
