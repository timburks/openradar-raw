        Summary:
        While playing certain songs, clipping issues with the elapsed time display can be observed (see attached screenshot).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Start playing “Json - Get It Got It (feat. S.O.)” from Apple Music
        2. Allow playback to proceed to any of the following times: 0:06, 0:09, 0:16, 0:19, 0:26, 0:29, 0:36, 0:39
        3. Notice that those (and possibly any times that end in “6” or “9”) are clipped
        4. Notice that other times are displayed correctly

        Expected Results:
        Playback time should always be visible.

        Actual Results:
        Playback time is clipped when elapsed time ends in 6 or 9.
