    description: "There are tangible negative side effects to viewing blue light in the evenings once the sun has set.  Anecdotally, I know of several people (including members of my family) that refuse to use a device that does not have the ability to eliminate blue light in the evenings and is the only thing keeping them off iOS devices (despite being heavy Mac users).\r\n\r\nHarvard study on Blue Light:\r\nhttp://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side\r\n\r\nA Huffington Post article regarding blue light:\r\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-matthew-alpert-od/blue-light_b_5570433.html\r\n(admittedly, this is plugging a product, but the information is relevant none-the-less)\r\n\r\nIf iOS could offer a system wide setting to enable blue light fade out (just like f.lux offers: https://justgetflux.com) it would provide a very health conscious solution to a very real and negative effect of using digital displays at night."
