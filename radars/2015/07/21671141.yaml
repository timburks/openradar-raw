    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes changing MPMusicPlayerController's shuffleMode when setting its queue to be the same as its current queue will cause setNowPlayingItem to stop working. Once it gets into this state where setNowPlayingItem doesn't work if you try to change the shuffleMode it will just clear its queue (which can also be reproduced in Music.app).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFor a given array of MPMediaItems \"items\":\r\n\r\n1) Run the following code:\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] setQueueWithItemCollection:[MPMediaItemCollection collectionWithItems:items]];\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] setShuffleMode:MPMusicShuffleModeDefault];\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] setNowPlayingItem:[items firstObject]];\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] play];\r\n\r\n2) Now try this code:\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] setQueueWithItemCollection:[MPMediaItemCollection collectionWithItems:items]];\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] setShuffleMode:MPMusicShuffleModeSongs];\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] setNowPlayingItem:[items firstObject]];\r\n\r\n[[MPMusicPlayerController systemMusicPlayer] play];\r\n\r\n3) Now either try calling MPMusicPlayerController's setNowPlayingItem with any item, or try changing its shuffleMode. (For the latter you can do so from code or from the system Music app's player).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe currently playing item changes (or the shuffle mode changes).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens (or the player is reset and closes).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB"
