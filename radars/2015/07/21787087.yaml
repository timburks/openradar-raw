    description: "Summary:\r\nNot long ago I moved all of my beta testing from Microsoft's HockeyApp over to Apple's TestFlight. This change has been wonderful overall made things so much easier for my testers and myself. Unfortunately I'm finding more and more things that are all but forcing me to go back to sending out Ad Hoc builds with HockeyApp.\r\n\r\nThere's no way to test iOS 9 builds externally through TestFlight. That made sense when you had to be a developer to use iOS 9, but now it's in public beta. iOS apps are getting more and more complex, with different features on different devices, and now they include watchOS apps too. I can't wait until the last minute to test major changes.\r\n\r\nThere's no way to use the CloudKit development environment with TestFlight. When I submit a build the production environment is selected automatically. That'd be fine if I could send people a Mac app that uses production, but I can't. See rdar://21787043\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere's how I see this working: if I submit an app that does something that isn't allowed in the App Store, like using a beta SDK or CloudKit's development environment, it gets marked as beta-only. These builds would be allowed for external TestFlight, but would not be selectable when you submit a build for App Store review.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
