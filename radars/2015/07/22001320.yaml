        Summary:
        I attempted to pay for a meal at McDonalds using Apple Pay on my Apple Watch. After presenting my watch to the reader the terminal went to "Authorising" and then displayed the message "Bank Security Check - Use card as prompted".

        Apparently this check happens occasionally on contactless cards to verify that you still remember your pin and that the card is not stolen. Unfortunately as I was using Apple Pay, I did not have a wallet and was unable to pay.

        As far as I can tell, this type of security check should not be presented when using Apple Pay as this is a replacement authorisation method to chip and pin. If this type of message is likely to happen then customers will have to ensure that they always carry a bank card as well as Apple Pay when attempting to pay.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use ApplePay to pay at McDonalds
        2. Potentially observe “Bank Security Check - Use card as prompted” message.
        3. Be unable to pay


        Expected Results:
        Payment should authorise and not require physical card or potentially ask to present phone and use TouchID

        Actual Results:
        Message is displayed and user is unable to pay due to lack of physical card to insert for pin entry
