        Summary:
        When writing unit tests, there is no way to test fatal errors. They immediately cause the entire test suite to stop. This makes a certain amount of sense, because fatal errors are best reserved for things that are either impossible or invalid. However, this causes noise in the code coverage. This code canâ€™t be invoked by the test suite, and is thus showing up as untested. This can cause visual noise and make it harder to quickly scan through files for legitimately untested code. I think it might make sense to highlight these cases in some other way.
