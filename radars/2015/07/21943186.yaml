        Summary:
        When I pull down the Spotlight search from any home page screen, the background behind the search bar and recommended items is monotone and awkwardly blurred.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Go to first home screen on my device, pull down Spotlight search. Go to second page, repeat, etc.

        Expected Results:
        Blurred background, which includes blur of icons/background wallpaper, should appear.

        Actual Results:
        Attached screenshot.

        Regression:
        Seeing it on latest beta for iPhone 6, US Verizon phone. Do not see this on my iPad running latest beta (1566 model)

        Notes:
        Nothing exceptional or notable as of 07/22/2015. Will update ticket if this changes.
