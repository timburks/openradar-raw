    description: "Summary:\r\nUnable to install new AdHoc version of an app over live version of it from the store. It doesn't launch the popup asking if the user wants to install the new version over the air.\r\nThis issue is a BIG one once it is the way we are testing database migration in production environment before sending it for AppStore review.\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download an app from AppStore\r\n2. Build a new version of the same app with adhoc provisioning profile\r\n3. Upload it on a server for OTA deployment\r\n4. Create the link that point to the server (eg. itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/abcd/123456.plist)\r\n5. Launch Safari on the device and enter the url\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6. A popup should ask the user if he want to install the app from the web server \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. Nothing Happen (White page in Safari)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 (13A4280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you delete the App from the store, the popup reappear magically.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
