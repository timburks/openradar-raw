        I want some computed properties in Swift that can throw, however, that doesn’t seem possible.

            func g(value: Int) throws -> Int { return value }

            struct F {
                var id: Int {
                    get { try g(0) }  // error, cannot throw
                }
            }

        I’ve found no way to mark this property as “throwable”.

        I expect to be able to to this:

            var id: Int throws {
                get { try g(0) }
            }
