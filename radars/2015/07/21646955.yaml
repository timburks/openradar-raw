    description: "Summary:\r\nFor all the focus on curation, Apple Music makes it very difficult to get to the (excellent) curated artist playlists, such as \"Intro to xxx\" or \"xxx: Deep Cuts\" unless they're presented to you in the For You section.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes or Music.app\r\n2. Search for an Artist, or view a page with a link to an artists page (via a \"similar artists\" suggestion or similar)\r\n3. Click to open that Artist Page (e.g., https://itun.es/us/pSgc)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe hand picked, Apple curated playlists (eg. \"Intro to David Bowie\", \"David Bowie: Deep Cuts\") should show, allowing you to easily dive into the Artist's music. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are shown \"Top Songs\",  \"Top Albums\", \"Albums\", \"Biography\" and \"Similar Artists\" but are not shown the curated playlists.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.2.0.145 / OS X 10.10.4, also reproducible on iOS 8.4 for iPhone/iPad\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThese playlists are shown in the search results, but at the very bottom of the page, and this doesn't help when you've clicked through directly to the artist page. Being able to dive directly into a \"Intro To\" playlist for a newly discovered / suggested artists seems like the ideal use for these."
