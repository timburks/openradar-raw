    description: "Summary:\r\nI understand that we have the ability to save albums, artists, and playlists for offline access, but I see no global option that says to download everything in My Music for offline. This would be a huge time-saver if implemented, and it would be a pain to those (including myself) that like to store their streaming music library on their high-capacity iOS Devices (for me, a 64-GB iPhone 6 Plus) to have to manually select every artist or album and select \"save for offline.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music\r\n2. Select \"My Music\" tab\r\n3. No option to save all music for offline access\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is an option (either in an inline menu item or settings or navigation bar) to save all music saved in \"My Music\" for offline playing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such option is available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 Beta 3 [13A4293g]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI personally think it would be good to add this feature, because it is also present in competitors' services (e.g. Spotify).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus 64GB Verizon, using Wi-Fi"
