        Summary:

        It’s not possible to easily select and copy or share a crash log from iOS Settings.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        - open Settings → Privacy (great place, sigh…) → Diagnostics & Usage → Diagnostics & Usage Data
        - select any of the log files

        Expected Results:

        There is a share button in the corner for easy sharing (e.g. send email to app developer or some internal system) or copying. Alternatively, long press on the text view should reveal an option to select all text.

        Actual Results: Nope and nope.

        Regression: Same as iOS 8
