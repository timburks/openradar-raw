    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile attempting to add padding to the `arrangedSubviews` of a `UIStackView`, I added regular UIViews as the arrangedSubviews and added labels with constraints within those. The label have a dynamic height, in that they are set to `numberOfLines = 0` and their text could change. \r\n\r\nIB renders this perfectly, and it renders perfectly on device as well. However, IB gives multiple warnings, indicating that the actual dimensions of the views in the UIStackView are actually different. These warnings shouldnâ€™t be there in this configuration and with this result.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unarchive attached .zip.\r\n2. Open NWAAlertController project.\r\n3. Open Main.Storyboard.\r\n4. View warnings in ViewController scene.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warnings should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFour warnings appear;\r\n\r\n2 of them due to IB determining that the UIViews containing the UILabels are actually height 0.\r\n2 of them due to IB determining that the UIButtons are height 30, even though I constrained them to height 40.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe project can also be found on Github: https://github.com/SpacyRicochet/NWAAlertController/commit/b73a455cd91499d1cdff43061a5f6977d80fca47"
