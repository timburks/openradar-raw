    description: "I've a quite complex view hierarchy including multiple MKMapViews. As soon as I activate the debug view hierarchy button Xcode crashes.\r\n\r\nIf I remove all MKMapViews from the view hierarchy before, Xcode doesn't crash.\r\n\r\nI've filed rdar://17486460 but this was closed as \"Fixed in Xcode 6\".\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not true in my case. The error still occurs reproducibly in Xcode 6.4 6E35b. Please see the attached crash report."
