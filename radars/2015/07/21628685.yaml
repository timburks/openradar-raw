    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen 2 apps are running simultaneously in iOS 9 multitasking split view, only one of the app can response to keyboard shortcut from external keyboard. That is the last app that user interacted with. \r\n\r\nUsing CMD-Tab, the primary and secondary apps in the split view are visible as the first 2 apps. Using that to select either the primary or secondary app, does nothing. \r\n\r\nSince CMD-Tab comes from the desktop paradigm, users may assume that it can be used to switch the active app, and the active app should be able to respond to keyboard shortcuts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an external bluetooth keyboard to an iPad Air 2\r\n2. Launch Safari\r\n3. Slide in Mail app from the side and drag it to make it into a secondary app.\r\n4. Assume the current active app is Safari, CMD-T will open a new tab. \r\n5. Tap CMD-Tab and select Mail app.\r\n6. Mail should now be the active app, so CMD-N should open a new composer window. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCMD-Tab should change the active app, and the active app should be able to respond to keyboard shortcuts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCMD-Tab does nothing if user select primary/secondary app. Only the last app that user interacted with will respond to keyboard shortcut. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 with external bluetooth keyboard"
