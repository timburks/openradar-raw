    description: Right now I am trying to build a game for the watch and I have found that haptic feedback greatly enhances the experience. I am trying to make the watch subtley vibrate when the user presses the correct button. Right now I am using WKHapticType "click" and it works well enough but I may still not include it because I am concerned about my app being rejected for using that haptic incorrectly. I'm proposing a new haptic type, doesn't have to be called impact but that is the name I came up with. It would be like a softer version of click for more general purposes uses. In addition to games it could be used with other apps, for example if 1password recreated it's vault opening/closing animation on the watch, it could vibrate as the vault closes or opens.
