        This is a duplicate of rdar://20168209

        It is probably bad that I have a source file with the following comment:

        // May be nil. Not tagged as nullable because clang would require we tagged everything in the file...

        I don't want to go through that file and add all the annotations. That would require going and talking to a lot of different engineers. But I do want to add an annotation to a new property I'm adding. Sadly, I cannot.
