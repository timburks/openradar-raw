    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://7274887\n\nSummary:\r\nThe objects returned by -[NSFetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:] and -[NSFetchedResultsController fetchedObjects] are full NSManagedObjects even if the resultType of the NSFetchRequest used by the NSFetchedResultsController is set to be NSManagedObjectIDResultType or NSDictionaryResultType.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Navigation-based Application from the iphone templates and check the box for using Core Data.\r\n2. Insert the line \"[fetchRequest setResultType:NSDictionaryResultType];\" on line 206 of RootViewController.m\r\n3. Insert the line \"NSLog(@\"%@\", [fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath]);\" between 129 and 130 of the same file.\r\n4. Build and Debug the application.\r\n5. Tap the + button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe line printed to the debugger should be a typical NSLog from an NSDictionary.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe line printed shows it's an NSManagedObject.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nValues that existed before the current run and loaded from the data store are actual NSDictionaries while the values added at runtime are NSManagedObjects."
