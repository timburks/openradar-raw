    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now, if one of my radars in Bug Reporter gets marked as a Duplicate, I get no notification when the radar, which mine was marked a duplicate of, gets closed.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a nice enhancement, as right now I have to check the state of my radars marked as duplicate manually from time to time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File a radar r1 at https://bugreport.apple.com/\r\n2. Apple marks the radar r1 as a Duplicate of a different radar r2 which is still open\r\n3. Get a notification that r1 was closed as a Duplicate\r\n4. Apple marks r2 as closed \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification to reporter of r1 that r2 was closed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Mac OS X 7.0.4 (9537.76.4)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
