    description: "0x7F is a DELETE control character. It is apparently \"skipped\" (not rendered, does not take up a column) in most Cocoa apps, although it clearly exists.\r\n\r\nFor some crazy reason, shift + up arrow + backspace will generate one of these. I had a habit of deleting a line of text and starting over by holding shift and up arrow, followed by a backspace, and these got stuck into all sorts of data/text I work with. Google results, IRC/AIM chats, emails, etc.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14291"
