        Whenever I try to automatically or manually backup my iPhone 6+ to iCloud, it works for a while and then fails with “The last backup could not be completed”. This could be a problem with my iCloud account or iPhone, but since it started with iOS 9, I figured I should report it here.

        The device console spits out this error:

        Jul 21 15:49:50 Moar backupd[343] <Warning>: WARNING: Files modified during backup
        Jul 21 15:49:50 Moar backupd[343] <Warning>: INFO: Not retrying after soft error: Couldn’t communicate with a helper application. (NSCocoaErrorDomain/4097)

        I’ll attach the full log file.
