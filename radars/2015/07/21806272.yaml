    description: "Summary:\r\nSFSafariViewController is ideal for OAuth authentication tasks in that it does not allow the developer to have access to the DOM (see Craig Hockenberry's blog: http://furbo.org/2014/09/24/in-app-browsers-considered-harmful/). However, using the SFSafariViewController for OAuth is confusing with the Done button in the upper right. With the SFSafariViewControllerDelegate, we can provide a warning if the user taps Done but has not finished the OAuth process (judging by our receiving an access token via URL scheme), but it's out of place nonetheless."
