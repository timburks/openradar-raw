        Summary:
        The current version of Keynote creates PDF exports with presenter notes that are very ugly and impact their usability.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a presentation with at least one page that has presenter notes.
        2. Export to PDF.
        3. Look at it.

        Expected Results:
        In Keynote ’09, the resulting PDF was visually appealing: the slides took up the majority of the page, with presenter notes legible at the bottom of the page.

        Actual Results:
        The current version of Keynote uses less than half of the page for the slide and the rest for the notes. This is a poor design choice. The notes are intended to be short reminders to me during a presentation, and serve as a way to help “fill in the blanks” for people who are reviewing the slides later. The slides should still be the focus, though. Right now, the layout makes it look like I’m expected to write paragraphs for each slide.

        Experimenting with other page sizes doesn’t help, either. The slide still occupies half or less of the page, and the presenter notes font size becomes comically large.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        No workarounds, although as I mentioned, export was fine in Keynote ’09.
