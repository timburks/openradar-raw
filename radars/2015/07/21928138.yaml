    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen deleting / renaming simulators in Devices window in Xcode this is not possible to select all the simulators and e.g. delete them. I have installed Xcode 6.4 and 3 betas of Xcode 7 - beta 2, beta 3, beta 4. I had about 60 simulators and had to remove them manually one by one. Terrible experience - every time I had to confirm that I want to delete them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. cmd+shift+2 to enter Devices window\r\n3. Try to select few simulators\r\n4. Not possible\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs a user I would like to select more than one simulator at a time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan select only one simulator\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMBPr 13 Late 2013, 10.10.3, Xcode 7 beta 4\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
