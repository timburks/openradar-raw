    description: "Summary:\nWhen I’m going to open an Application, I’m going to use Spotlight, as it is really convenient and super-efficient. But sometimes, Spotlight tricks me to open an Application I certainly didn’t want to open.\n\nExample:\nI type “qui” and Spotlight already shows “QuickRadar.app”, which is the app i want to start. But as my hands type faster than my head realizes it, I type further to “quick” + enter, but right by tapping the “k” Spotlight changes the suggestion to “QuickTime Player”, which is quite confusing and unexpected, as “quick” still matches on “QuickRadar.app”. \n\nSo please, don’t change the first proposal as long as the entered characters still are perfectly matching the current proposal.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nNot sure if this can be easily reproduced on other machines (does Spotlight some kind of learn from my actions?)\n\nExpected Results:\nChanging my input from “qui” to “quick” should not change the proposal from “QuickRadar.app” to “QuickTime Player”\n\nActual Results:\nI’m confused and get slightly angry when I open the QuickTime Player instead of being able to quickly file radars.\n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
