        Summary:
        I get a swift compiler crash and it seems to happen when I declare a closure property with the same name and signature as another function in the class.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Compile the following piece of code:

        class GenericClass<T> {
        	private var publish: T -> ()
        	
        	func publish(message: T) {
        		self.publish(message)
        	}
        }
