    description: MPMediaPickerController used to give a visual indication that an item was selected prior to iOS 8.4. In 8.4 when a picker is displayed and allowsPickingMultipleItems is set to true, it does show that items are selected in mediaPicker:didPickMediaItems but while picking, selected items simply highlight (sometimes) but then just flip back to a normal display without highlighting the + indicator.
