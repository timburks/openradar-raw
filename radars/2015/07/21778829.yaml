    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://21139998\r\n\r\nI don't have a copy of the original description text , so I will paraphrase. Please see https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/05/28/activity-rings/\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the Activity complication, it difficult to see whether one of the rings is very close to being completed or actually completed.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion is to change the color of the ring slightly when completed, as a subtle indication that it is complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Choose a watch face that allows the display of the Activity complication\r\n2. Perform activities that increase the value of any of the Activity rings\r\n3. Check in the Activity app until one of the rings is nearly complete\r\n4. Switch back to the watch face, and look at the Activities complication\r\n5. Continue the activity until the Activity app shows the ring is complete or until you see the achievement for that activity\r\n6. Switch back to the watch face, and look at the Activities complication\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to tell that the activity is complete just by glancing at the Activities complication\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to see that the activity is complete in the Activities complication on the watch face. It is much too subtle."
