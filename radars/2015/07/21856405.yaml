        Summary:
        My grandmother watches Netflix and HBO content on her Apple TV. I had to turn on the SDH captions for her, even though she can mostly hear, because she couldn’t clearly distinguish the dialog amongst the rest of the mix. This was a big improvement over the massively boosted volume levels they had been resorting to.

        It would be very helpful if the Apple TV (or really any iOS device) could have an Accessibility setting to boost frequencies around 85-255 Hz, possibly with different levels (Low, Medium, High) that would allow people who aren’t completely deaf to still enjoy their video content without resorting to dangerously high volume levels that further damage hearing, or captions that obstruct the content.
