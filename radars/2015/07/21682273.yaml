        Summary:
        Xcode produces error while building project: Swift Compiler Error. Command failed due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Unzip attached project. Build it.

        Expected Results:
        Expected project to be built.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode produces error while building project: Swift Compiler Error. Command failed due to signal: Segmentation fault: 11.

        Regression:
        See lines 54-57 of ViewController.swift
        Line 54 is the source of problems.
        Comment line 54 and uncomment lines 56 and 57 - project gets built and runs normally.
        In Xcode 7 beta error message is different but problem is there.

        Notes:
        Workaround is to split line 54 on to separate lines 56 and 57.
