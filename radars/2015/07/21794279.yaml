        Summary:
        When I go to add a developer team to my Xcode server, I select add, enter the credentials, click add to my team, and then wait. Once the dialog box disappears, it says there are “No Teams” that have been added. I’m left with nothing

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Click Add from XcodeServer next to Developer Teams
        2) Type in my credentials
        3) Confirm “Add” that I want to add it to the development team
        4) Wait for “Adding [Name]” dialog to disappear.
        5) Left with nothing… No teams have been added.

        Expected Results:
        Should be added to a team

        Actual Results:
        Not added to a team
