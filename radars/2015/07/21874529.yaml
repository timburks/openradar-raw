        Summary:
        When building an iOS project (iOS 9+) for a device, Xcode 7 will hang on compilation of some swift files. It will never timeout or complete. The build just hangs while compiling.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have many swift files
        2. set the build target to a physical device
        3. Build for device (not necessary to hit “run”, just “build”)

        Expected Results:
        The compilation completes with a build success or build failure

        Actual Results:
        The build hangs while attempting compiling some swift files.

        Regression:
        - This issue did not occur previously with this exact same build of Xcode, but now occurs 100% without a workaround.
        - This issue does not occur when building for the simulator.
        - This issue did not occur in Beta 2.
        - The files that will not compile are inside a dynamic framework that contains only swift files. I have not had any issue with Swift files outside of the dynamic library in my application. Several swift files inside the dynamic library *will* compile, but some will simply hang. Removing the file from the dynamic framework target will progress it to another file, but it will eventually hang compiling on another swift file.
        - Commenting out everything in the offending swift file does not affect this issue

        Notes:
        One note for this that might be relevant is that I opened this project in Xcode 6 to validate that setting BITCODE_ENABLED to false wouldn’t affect the project when building a subproject in Xcode 6.
