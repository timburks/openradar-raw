        If I’m using a site where I have multiple accounts (e.g. Amazon, where I have an AWS account and a shopping account), and I go to update my password on a page where I’m not also updating the username at the same time, Safari can sometimes clobber (overwrite) the passwords of the other accounts on the site that I’m not currently logged in with.

        It seems like if Safari sees multiple usernames listed in iCloud Keychain for a single site (or wildcard domain update), then it should prompt the user to ask them which username is having the password updated.
