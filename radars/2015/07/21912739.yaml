    description: "Summary:\r\nExtensions (for classes, structs, enums) have a number of uses. One common use is to organize methods and computed properties within a necessarily complex type by (e.g.) functionality within a single file. Unfortunately, all stored properties must be defined within the original type definition.\r\n\r\nI suggest that extensions within the same file as the original type definition should be allowed to define stored properties. This would enhance the use case where extensions are used to organize code by allowing stored properties to be grouped with their corresponding stored properties and methods.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSwift 2 (Xcode 7 beta 3)"
