    description: "Summary:\r\nIf it is 1:00 PM, and I ask Siri \"Set alarm for 4:45\", I expect that to set an alarm for 4:45 PM. However, Siri sets it for 4:45 AM, which means I miss my alarm at 4:45 PM if I didn't look closely at what Siri did. Even if I say \"Set alarm for 4:45 TODAY\", it will set the alarm for 4:45 AM the following morning.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if, when AM/PM are not specified, Siri would choose the next likely time, or prompt the user to specify AM or PM to resolve the ambiguity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Activate Siri\r\n2. Say \"Set alarm for 4:45\"\r\n3. Look at the alarm that Siri created.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf it is before 4:45 PM, then I would expect \"4:45\" to mean \"4:45 PM\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri sets alarm for 4:45 AM the following morning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6 with iOS 8.4"
