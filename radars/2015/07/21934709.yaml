    description: "Summary:\r\nI use Siri in \"Spanish (Mexico)\" language. If I ask Siri \"Qué tengo para hacer hoy\" (roughly \"what do I have to do today\"), it tells me it didn't find any event matching \"hacer\" (\"do\").\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure Siri is configured for Spanish language\r\n2. Hold home button to trigger Siri\r\n3. Ask \"Que tengo para hacer hoy\" (native spanish speaker recommended :P)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Siri to tell me all the calendar events I have for today.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri replies \"No encontré eventos para hoy sobre “hacer”.\" (meaning \"I didn't find events for today about 'do'\"). It wrongly interprets the word \"hacer\" as a search term for events.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can also reproduce this bug on my father's iPhone 5s with iOS 8.4. This bug is almost certainly server-side so the iOS version is not important.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation, 32GB, A1421, MD720E/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'siri-hacer.png' was successfully uploaded."
