    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen \"security\" command line utility is used in interactive mode (launched with \"-i\" key) to manage keychains, any command that takes keychain file path as the last parameter will incorrectly treat that parameter if it's a relative path starting with a tilde (~). Instead of expanding the tilde to current user's home directory, the command appends that path to \"/Users/<username>/Library/Keychains/\" and uses the result as absolute path, creating directories if needed. This affects commands such as \"create-keychain\", \"delete-keychain\", \"lock-keychain\", \"unlock-keychain\", \"set-keychain-password\", \"set-keychain-settings\", etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFor example, say we want to create a keychain and put the keychain file on current user's desktop.\r\n\r\n1. Launch Terminal.\r\n2. Launch \"security\" in interactive mode by executing \"security -i\"\r\n3. In the interactive console, paste \"create-keychain \"~/Desktop/test.keychain\". You'll be asked to create and retype a password â€“ anything will do.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn this scenario, I expect the keychain file to be created on my desktop: in /Users/<username>/Desktop/test.keychain\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keychain file is created at /Users/<username>/Libraries/Keychains/~/Desktop/test.keychain\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue does not affect non-interactive commands of \"security\" utility."
