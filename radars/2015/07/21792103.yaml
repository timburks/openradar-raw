    description: "Summary:\r\nOur own name is one of the dearest words. When meeting a person whose name is hard to pronounce, or has more than one pronunciation, a polite thing to do is to ask how the person likes their name to be pronounced.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Siri just picks one option and uses it. It expects to be corrected. I naturally figured out that I can tell Siri “you pronounce my name wrong”. Some people don’t, and are very annoyed by the wrong pronunciation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an a name which is hard to pronounce, or has more than one pronunciation.\r\n2. Use Siri.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBefore using the name for the first time, ask which pronunciation is preferred.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri will eventually pronounce the name. And it might get it wrong."
