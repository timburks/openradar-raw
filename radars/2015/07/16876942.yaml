    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen restoring an older version of \"My Important Document.fancydoc\" with Time Machine, and electing to \"Keep Both\", a file named \"My Important Document (original).fancydoc\" appears. \r\n\r\nThere's no certainty about whether this is the original file as restored from Time Machine, or the original file as displaced by Time Machine. Without performing an inspection of the two files or file packages, I never know which one I want to keep.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Restore a file or file package from Time Machine\r\n2. Elect to \"Keep Both\"\r\n3. Quick, figure out which one is which.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEven if metadata like file size or modification dates aren't dispositive, as they often aren't in the case of file packages, it should be clear at a glance which file was just restored by Time Machine. Using the suffix \"(restored)\", for instance, would be unambiguous.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrippling uncertainty, requiring domain knowledge about the specifics of the file(s) being restored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.2"
