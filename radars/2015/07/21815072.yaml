    description: "Description:\r\nThe App Store should prohibit leaving reviews when the user is running a beta version of iOS.\r\n\r\nFrom the developer side, this would discourage the current impossible situation where a user is using a beta version of iOS without a fix for a critical bug causing an app to crash or fail. When the public betas lag the developer betas, this is even more painful, as the developer knows there's a fix and is penalized anyway.\r\n\r\nFrom the Apple side, it would avoid the need for Apple to police App Store reviews and remove negative reviews related to beta iOS issues. It's great that the App Store folks do remove such reviews (thanks!), but it's a waste of time and money which could be put to more productive use.\r\n\r\nFrom the user side, it would be even better if they were directed to an explanation or were encouraged to email the developer's support address if they attempt to leave a review.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. User installs iOS Beta\r\n2. User launches App\r\n3. App crashes or fails\r\n4. User leaves negative review for App\r\n\r\n(Often, developer has iOS 9-specific version planned or ready with fix for problem in #3. Developer can't release this until iOS 9 ships.)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/lucvandal/status/620213084934795264\r\n\r\nCommentary:\r\nhttp://www.macstories.net/stories/on-negative-app-store-reviews-during-betas-of-ios-and-os-x/\r\n\r\nAdditional commentary:\r\nhttp://www.loopinsight.com/2015/07/12/on-negative-app-store-reviews-during-betas-of-ios-and-os-x/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser is prohibited from leaving App Store reviews during beta. They are directed to an explanation or encouraged to email the developer's support address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser is able to leave negative reviews when running beta versions of iOS for problems the developer cannot fix.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device\r\n\r\nVersion & Build:\r\nAny beta iOS"
