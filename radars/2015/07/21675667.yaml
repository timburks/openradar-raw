    description: "Greg Koenig04-Jul-2015 06:18 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nListening to Music Radio and \"Loving\" a song has no direct follow-up; the song is not added to a smart playlist or otherwise noted for me to be able to go back and re-listen or add it to my library. There is no easy way to find that song again, making music discovery a complete pain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Listen to Beats1.\r\n2. Like a song enough to hit the heart icon to \"Love\" it.\r\n3. There is no step 3, that is the problem\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA song that I mark as \"Loved\" should be automatically added to a smart playlist, listed (by default) in chronological order. This way, music one discovers on Beats1 or a radio playlist can be listened to again and/or added to My Music collection.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing. No way to find songs I've Loved.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS + OS X"
