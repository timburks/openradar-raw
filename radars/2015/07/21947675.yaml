        Summary:
        In Xcode 7, you can’t make a unit testing target that targets a WatchKit 2 app or watchOS Framework.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a WatchKit Extension in your iPhone app.
        2. Create a new Unit Testing target.
        3. Try to set the WatchKit Extension as the target of the Unit Testing target.

        Expected Results:
        You can unit test your watchOS app.

        Actual Results:
        You can’t choose the WatchKit Extension (or the watch app, for that matter) as the target of the test target.

        Regression:
        Also not possible with WatchKit 1

        Notes:
        UI Testing for the watch would be AMAZING.
