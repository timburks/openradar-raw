    description: "I installed Xcode 7.0 b3 and launched it the first time. It crashes right away when selecting any command from the menu bar.\r\n\r\nThe Backtrace led me to believe it's related to the SCM repos. So I deleted all git repos using Xcode 6.x.\r\nThis solved the crash.\r\n\r\nThe problem is a regression from Xcode 7.0 b2."
