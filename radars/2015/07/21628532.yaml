    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 9 multitasking split view, only one of the 2 visible app can respond to keyboard shortcuts from external keyboard. Unlike in desktop where the active window is obvious, this is not the case for iOS. There is no visual hint to indicate which is the active window that can respond.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPad Air 2 with an external keyboard using bluetooth.\r\n2. Launch Safari \r\n3. Slide in Mail app from the right side and drag to make Mail app the secondary app.\r\n4. Type CMD-N in external keyboard to open a new composer in Mail\r\n5. Type CMD-T in external keyboard to open a new tab in Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. CMD-N should open a new composer in Mail, if Mail is the current active app.\r\n2. CMD-T should open a new tab in Safari, if Safari is the current active app. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to tell which is the current active app. \r\nIf Safari is the current active app when CMD-N is typed, there is no response.\r\nIf Mail is the current active app when CMD-T is typed, there is no response. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 with external bluetooth keyboard"
