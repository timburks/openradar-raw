    description: "Summary:\r\nAny request for CloudKit will always get CKError - \"Internal Error\" (1/4000); \"Couldn't get a signing certificate\". Some of our devices could still connect with CloudKit, some of them couldn't yesterday. But today, all of our devices can't connect with CloudKit and our users also encounter same issues!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Loopify App (Apple ID: 1003174079)\r\n2. You will find there is always \"Disconnect with Loopify\"\r\n\r\nAll the errors are the same, CKError - \"Internal Error\" (1/4000); \"Couldn't get a signing certificate\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWithout error, get the records from Loopify (based on CloudKit).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDisconnect with CloudKit!\r\n\r\nSame error: CKError - \"Internal Error\" (1/4000); \"Couldn't get a signing certificate\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4s / 5s / 6 / 6 Plus, iPod Touch 4th and iPad.
