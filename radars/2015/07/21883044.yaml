        Summary:
        As of iOS 9, AddressBook.framework is deprecated in favor of Contacts.framework. However, MapKit and CoreLocation still use the legacy addressDictionary format extensively, in some cases, requiring it for some activities, such as creating an MKMapItem. Instead, it should be replaced by a CNPostalAddress property.
