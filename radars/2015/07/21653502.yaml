    description: "When I add a newly created \"SnowParticle.sks\" into \"GameScene.sks\" as a reference node and then start simulating the Scene Editor it instantly crashes Xcode\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce\r\n- Create a default SpriteKit iOS app with Swift\r\n- Add a Snow Particle\r\n- Add a Reference Node to GameScene.sks and Choose that SnowParticle.sks\r\n- Click on \"Animate\"\r\n\r\nExpected Result\r\nThe Particule should be seen the same way as if I reproduce 1-to-1 the settings in SnowParticle in an EmitterNode in the scene (that works)\r\n\r\nActual Result\r\nXcode crashes with the attached Crash Report"
