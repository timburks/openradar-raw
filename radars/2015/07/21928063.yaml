        Summary:
        Typaliased tuples canâ€™t have their members referenced as functions.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        let f = Mirror.Child.label

        Expected Results:
        f should be a function (Mirror.Child) -> (String?)

        Actual Results:
        This fails to compile, saying:
        error: 'Child.Type' does not have a member named 'label'
