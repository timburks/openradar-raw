    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen MFMailComposeViewController is presented by a UIActivityViewController then dismissed using dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:, neither -[UIActivity activityDidFinish:] nor UIActivityViewController's completion block gets called, and there is no way to do so after dismissing it because there is no way to get a handle to the UIMailActivity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExecute this code in a view controller. When the share sheet appears, choose Mail to open the email composer.\r\n\r\n- (IBAction)foo\r\n{\r\n    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(5 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\r\n        [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    UIActivityViewController *c = [[UIActivityViewController alloc] initWithActivityItems:@[ @\"foo\" ] applicationActivities:nil];\r\n    c.completionWithItemsHandler = ^(NSString *activityType, BOOL completed, NSArray *returnedItems, NSError *activityError) {\r\n        NSLog(@\"completion\");\r\n    };\r\n    [self presentViewController:c animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter 5 seconds, the mail composer is programmatically dismissed. -[UIActivity activityDidFinish:NO] is called, and the completion handler is executed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter 5 seconds, the mail composer is programmatically dismissed. -[UIActivity activityDidFinish:NO] is not called, and the completion handler is not executed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on iOS 7.1.1, iOS 8.1, iOS 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is probably reproducible on any iOS >= 6.0.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 4S, 5 devices and 5S simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
