    description: "CSSearchableItemAttributeSet has properties to describe a location: a latitude, a longitude, and a namedLocation. However, there’s only room for one such location in the attributes\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to set an array of locations as the item attributes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be an API like CSSearchableItemAttributeSet.locations. It also could make use of the CoreLocation objects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere’s no such API.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* There is a number of GPS* attributes, including GPSDestLatitude and GPSDestLongitude. However, they seem to have no effect. In fact, all these GPS* attributes seem to find their origin in kCGImagePropertyGPSDictionary, and may actually be unrelated the namedLocation/latitude/longitude properties.\r\n\r\n* The text in \"namedLocation\" is searchable in Spotlight, and the lat/long can be opened in maps.app. I suspect that the latitude/longitude are also used by Spotlight/Siri to provide relevant results. \r\n\r\n* See also radars 22029706 and 22029715, related to CoreSpotlight documentation."
