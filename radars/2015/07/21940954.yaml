    description: "Summary:\r\niOS automatically increases screen brightness when opening the passbook app. This was appropriate when Passbook only contained passes that required scanning. Now, with the introduction of ApplePay, cards are also displayed in Passbook/Wallet and do not require screen scanning.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to increase screen brightness when viewing a passbook pass and return the screen brightness to normal when on the list of cards or when viewing a ApplePay card.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Passbook\r\nObserve increased screen brightness\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreen brightness should not increase until I click on a passbook pass\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen brightness is increased until passbook app is closed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 [12H143]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
