    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen listening to Beats1 though iTunes 12.2, clicking the Heart icon in the now playing bar does not heart the song, but instead appears to Heart Beats1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes to the Radio tab\r\n2. Play Beats1\r\n3. Wait for a great track to play\r\n4. Click the Heart icon in the Now Playing area of iTunes, right next to the Track Name \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe currently playing track is hearted / loved, and displays in smart playlists. When the track playing on Beats1 changes, the Heart icon returns to itâ€™s unfilled state, allowing you to heart the next great track.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe track does not show in any smart playlists based on Loved tracks, and the Heart icon remains filled for all future tracks played on Beats1."
