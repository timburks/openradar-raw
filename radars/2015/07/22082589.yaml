        Steps to Reproduce:
        1.-5. Download the example project + xliff as created by the following steps: https://www.dropbox.com/s/c1x1yy6qpcby2jy/Bugreport-LocalizationExample.zip?dl=0

        - OR -

        1. Create a new iOS Single View Application
        2. Add a localized string to the code, f.e. in the app delegate:

           NSLog("%@", NSLocalizedString("Example", comment: "Example"))

        3. Add a localization in the Project settings, f.e. German
        4. Select the project and export xliffs using Editor > Export For Localization
        5. Edit the resulting de.xliff file and add a translation for the Example text

        ---

        6. Select the project and choose Editor > Import Localizations - choose to import de.xliff

        Xcode crashes only when the Localizable.strings file doesn't exist already when importing - if one is created manually and localized for Base, it works as expected.
