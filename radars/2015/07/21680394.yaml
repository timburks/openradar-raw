    description: "Summary:\r\nI think it would be useful for a developer to be able to disable a UIMotionEffect without removing it.  When disabled the motion effect would not update the but it would not restore remove its effect.  \r\n\r\nEg:\r\n1. you tilt the device - the motion changes the view's values\r\n2. you disable the effect - the motion effect stops updating the view's values but _doesn't_ reset the relative change to zero (unlike when you remove the effect)\r\n3. You tilt the device\r\n4. You re-enable the effect - the motion effect updates the views values (smoothly - no jumping).\r\n\r\nIn an app I'm working on I want to disable a motion effect while the user is using a long press to reorder a collection of views and then re-enable it when the long press ends.  Currently removing the effects causes views to jump around which is quite visually jarring.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe API doesn't support this directly.  I'm now investigating ways or working around this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.4 (6E35b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8.4 SDK\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
