    description: "Summary:\r\nLocation-based reminders are not available on the iPod touch, probably because of the lack of GPS.\r\n\r\nIf I ask Siri on an iPod touch to remind me about something when I get home, and my own contact (as selected in Siri settings) doesn't have my home address, Siri first says it doesn't know my home address and tells me to add it. Only after I add my address and try adding a home reminder again, it tells me location reminders are not available on iPod.\r\n\r\nThis is a waste of time for the user; from the initial response he will think location reminders will work as soon as he sets his address information, and will be disappointed to find it still doesn't work after typing in his address. \"Why didn't you tell me earlier?\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNote again that this should be tested on an iPod touch, not an iPhone!\r\n\r\n1. Make sure your own contact does *not* have a home address and that Siri knows that contact is you (in Siri settings > My Info).\r\n2. Ask Siri to remind you about something when you get home. It doesn't matter whether you provide reminder text, ie. whether you say \"Remind me when I get home\" or \"Remind me to water the plants when I get home\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should say location-based reminders are not available on iPod touch immediately when I try to create one, without having me fill my address information first.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri answers \"I don't know your home address. Tap your name if you'd like to add it\". Once I tap my name, type in all my address information, and ask Siri again to set the reminder (possibly also hitting the related bug rdar://21935248), Siri says \"Sorry, I can't create location-based reminders on this device.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know I'm using an old iOS version, but I'm pretty sure this Siri bug is server-side, and upgrading iOS to 8.x wouldn't fix it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation, 32GB, A1421, MD720E/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'siri-reminders-address.png' was successfully uploaded."
