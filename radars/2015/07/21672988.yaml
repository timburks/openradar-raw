        Summary:
        Typically in the iTunes music menu one can right click a song and click New Playlist from Selection to create a new playlist with the included song(s). This functionality does not exist in Apple Music, and the Add To Playlist menu does not allow creating a new playlist.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Right click a song in Apple Music (that isn't a local file), and attempt to create a new playlist.

        Expected Results:
        New Playlist (along with the currently available playlists) available in the Add To Playlist menu, or the ability to create a "New Playlist from Selection".

        Actual Results:
        The Add to Playlist submenu only shows playlists that are already made without the ability to create a new one.

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        This functionality does not exist on OS X or iOS.
