        Sometimes it’s useful to know build time stats. Per method, per file, whole project, … So far we have:

        1) Whole project build time

        Officially not supported preferences:

           defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration YES

        2) We can use hidden flags of Swift compiler to find what causes long compile time

          -Xfrontend -debug-time-function-bodies

        But what’s missing is compile time per file.

        Would be nice to have these officially supported along with new per file build/compile time.
