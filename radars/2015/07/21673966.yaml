    description: "Summary:\r\nSpotlight becomes unusable after having been dismissed while doing the \"show desktop\" gesture on the trackpad.\r\nWhen dismissing spotlight while doing a \"show desktop\" gesture, it incorrectly is positioned very close to the edge of the screen after returning from the desktop only view and thus isn't usable any longer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make the spotlight search field appear by pressing ⌘ + space bar\r\n2. Start doing the \"show desktop\" gesture by spreading your thumb and three fingers on the trackpad\r\n3. While still being within the \"show desktop\" gesture, dismiss the spotlight window by pressing ⌘ + space bar again\r\n4. Complete the \"show desktop\" gesture until the desktop is fully visible\r\n5. Return from the \"show desktop\" gesture by doing the reverse gesture: distract your thumb and three fingers on the trackpad\r\n6. Fire up spotlight again by pressing ⌘ + space bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe spotlight search field should appear at its standard position (centered in screen) or at the position it was last dragged to by the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe spotlight search field window appears on the edge of the screen, mostly hidden and not accessible for the user.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 (15A204h)"
