        Summary:
        On this build, Finder is extremely slow, and several files don’t appear in folders until restarting finder.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Boot El Capitan
        2) Login, and use computer for over 24 hours. Some tasks to perform:
        	a) Move several files around.
        	b) Copy several files of various sizes
        	c) Export photos from Photos app
        3) Open Activity Monitor
        4) Observe Disk usage of Finder
        5) Open Finder
        6) Navigate to a folder that hasn’t been opened in several hours

        Expected Results:
        4) Expected Bytes Read of Finder to be at a reasonable level
        6) Expected Finder to show all contents of folder

        Actual Results:
        4) My Finder has read 69.03 GB from disk after ~21 hours of uptime. It is continuously climbing.
        6) Finder is consistently not showing all contents of folders. Some folders appear empty, some have new files just not present.

        Most recently, I downloaded a file and it appears in the Downloads fan in the dock, but finder doesn’t show the file in the downloads folder.

        Regression:
        I did not observe this behavior prior to 10.11 beta 3

        Notes:
        Workaround: Reboot computer or Restart Finder every couple of hours.
