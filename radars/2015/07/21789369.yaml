    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes writing short examples in headers helps the developer to understand the API. I wish Xcode would have a dedicated place in its documentation viewer for \"Usage\" or \"Example\" code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with a swift file with the contents:\r\n\r\n/// dispatch_after block after a delay\r\n///\r\n/// - usage:\r\n///\r\n///     delay(0.5) {\r\n///     }\r\n///\r\nfunc delay(seconds: Double, block: dispatch_block_t) {\r\n    let delayTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, Int64(seconds * Double(NSEC_PER_SEC)))\r\n    dispatch_after(delayTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), block)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Alt + Click on the name of the function just declared\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI think it would be nicer to support \"Usage\" tag like in the attached picture (usage.png). (See link below)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"- usage\" or any other string is interpreted as simple markdown. There is no way to have a *dedicated* place for sample code. (I am aware of pre and code tags in markdown.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'usage.png' was successfully uploaded. -->\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/nacho4d/status/620490876825899008"
