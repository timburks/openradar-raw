        Summary:
        After telling a website to open in Safari from an in-app SFSafariViewController, the OS does not embed a "Back to AppName" in the title bar of Safari.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an app in a SFSafariViewController in a third-party app
        2. Tap the Open in Safari button (bottom right) in the SVC toolbar
        3. Decide you want to go back to the app.

        Expected Results:
        Press the "Back to AppName" link in the upper left of the app that iOS 9 does implicitly for things like spotlight searches.

        Actual Results:
        Must double-tap home button and switch back.
