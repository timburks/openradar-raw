    description: "The JavaScript method self.valueOf() throws an error when called from a web worker in Safari 8, also indirectly e.g. in (self + \"\"). Older Safari versions don't seem affected by the problem.\r\n\r\nFor a trivial example, create file named \"worker.js\" containing a single line of code:\r\n\r\n    self + \"\";\r\n\r\nThen in an HTML file, start a web worker using the \"worker.js\" file above.\r\n\r\n    <script>new Worker('worker.js');</script>\r\n\r\nIn Safari 8, in the debug console, you can see the error:\r\n\r\n    TypeError: undefined is not an object"
