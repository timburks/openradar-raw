    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a custom collection view layout that place views on top of each other. All but one view is collapsed to a reduced height. When a cell is tapped that becomes the full height view and all cells should smoothly animate to their new positions. The expanding view animates properly but the shrinking view immediately jumps to its reduced size then animates into position. See the gif in the readme for a demonstration.\r\n\r\nGithub repo with the project to demonstrate: https://github.com/civatrix/StackCollectionViewLayout\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run project on any device or simulator\r\n2. Tap \"Cell 1\"\r\n3. Tap \"Cell 0\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter tapping \"Cell 1\", \"Cell 0\" should animate it's height change along side \"Cell 1\"\r\nAfter tapping \"Cell 0\", \"Cell 1\" should animate it's height change along side \"Cell 0\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter tapping \"Cell 1\", \"Cell 0\" immeditaly becomes it's new collapsed height\r\nAfter tapping \"Cell 0\", \"Cell 1\" immeditaly becomes it's new collapsed height and moves to it's final position\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAll final cell frames are correct, it's just the animation that is the issue\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
