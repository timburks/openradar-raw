    description: "Summary:\r\nIf we set up the background color of views,buttons, etc on a storyboard the colors look slightly darker than the correct ones often; but setting the values via code shows the correct colors when running both on device and simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the background color of a view via Storyboard to RGB(0,159,242)\r\nCompile and run; see the rendered color (take a screenshot).\r\n\r\nThe on viewDidLoad or wherever; even on the buttonâ€™s action if you want to set the background color of the button to RGB(0,159,242) via code, compile and run and notice how the colors are render differently. (take a screenshot).\r\n\r\nOpen up Adobe CC or similar and then pickcolor both background colors and compare; notice how the values set via code match the correct RGB values but the color set on IB is off\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSetting the background color of a button via IB or code should show the exact same color.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe colors when set via IB are slightly darker than when set via code.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is HIGHLY critical since we try most of the UI via IB and we set the RGB or HEX colors our designers send to us from PS directly into Xcode and the wrong colors are sometimes hard to perceive but overall WRONG and the tools should correctly render the values specified.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. set background color of a view to #FFFFD0\r\n2. run the app\r\n3. note that color is not #FFFFD0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the color set in IB to be the color I set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes it is not the same color that I set.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nxcode 6.3.1 osx 10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nworkaround is to set the color in code rather than interface builder\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nxcode 6.3.1 osx 10.10.3 late 2013 27 inch iMac"
