        It should be possible to declare two functions that only differ in signature by a “throws”.

            func f() -> Int {
                return 1
            }

            func f() throws -> Int {
                return 2
            }

            f()
            try f()

        It should never be syntactically ambiguous which function is to be called as try is required for any throwing function.
