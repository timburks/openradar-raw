    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn 10.10.4, the \"trimforce\" command was added to enable TRIM commands on third-party drives. It currently has the following functions:\t\r\n\r\ntrimforce enable\r\ntrimforce disable\r\ntrimforce help\r\n\r\nI would like to request an additional function:\r\n\r\ntrimforce status\r\n\r\nThe \"trimforce status\" command would let you know if TRIM support has been enabled on a third-party SSD via the use of the \"trimforce enable\" command."
