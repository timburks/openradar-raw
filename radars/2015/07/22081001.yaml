    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen in the middle of an Apple Music playlist, choosing to add another playlist to Up Next has them playing next, instead of added to the end\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a “For You” Apple Music curated playlist (“Playlist A”)\r\n2. Let several songs play\r\n3. Navigate to another curated Apple Music playlist (“Playlist B”)\r\n4. Tap the “…” button for the whole playlist\r\n5. Tap “Add to Up Next”\r\n6. Tap on the mini player\r\n7. Tap on the Up Next button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe songs get added to the end of the Up Next queue, so all of the songs from B are after the remaining songs from A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter step 5, the HUD’s image shows the arrow pointing to the bottom of the stack, but then B’s songs are listed as “Up Next”, followed by “Resume: Playlist A” and the rest of A’s songs"
