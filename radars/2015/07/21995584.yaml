    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a group message with my family (6 people total). It's named \"Family\". However, even though members of the family all send messages only on that thread, it will frequently split into an unnamed, separate thread with all 6 family members. The split won't happen for all family members at the same time (e.g. it'll split on my phone but not my brother's, and later it will split on my brother's phone but not mine).\r\n\r\nMy phone is currently on iOS 9 beta 4, but this was happening when it was on iOS 8 as well. The rest of my family members are mostly on iOS 8, and one or two of them is on iOS 7. We're all on Verizon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm not sure. It happens randomly, but it happens daily without fail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect messages sent to a named group thread to always stay on that thread and never split up into a separate thread.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe messages split into separate threads\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 4, iOS 8, iOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB, Verizon"
