    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS7, it was possible to configure your \"Preferred Directions\" when using Maps.app, so requests in Siri to \"give me directions to ____\" could automatically provide walking directions is desired, instead of always defaulting to driving directions. In iOS8, that option is no longer present in Settings.app. This is especially annoying on the Apple Watch, where exiting the driving directions and switching to walking directions is less streamlined.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings.app\r\n2. Scroll down and open the \"Maps\" settings\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaps settings should contain a \"Preferred Directions\" setting, allowing you to choose between \"Walking\" or \"Driving\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Preferred Directions\" setting no longer exists.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe previous functionality in iOS 7 was well documented online, eg. in this Engadget iPhone 101 article: http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/02/iphone-101-always-show-walking-directions-in-ios-maps/\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, 128GB (MG4A2X/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS8 Settings.PNG' and 'iOS7 Settings.jpg' were successfully uploaded."
