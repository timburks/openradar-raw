    description: "When a UIPopoverController is presented using the following API:\r\n\r\npresentPopoverFromRect:inView:animated\r\n\r\non iOS8 the preferredContentSize of the UIViewController that is contained in the UIPopoverController will be modified to allow it to fit inside the available space, whereby the available space is determined by the keyboard and the edges of the screen.\r\nThis means that the \"rect\" parameter will be respected and the UIPopoverController will be drawn such that it has a size may not be the preferredContentSize but will have the arrow drawn into the rect.\r\n\r\non iOS9 this is not done and the rect parameter is completely ignored if the preferredContentSize is higher than the available space. In particular if the \"height\" parameter of the preferredContentSize is greater than the height to the keyboard or the bottom of the screen then the UIPopverController does not have the arrow pointing to the specified rect. Instead it's drawn at some random position covering other UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an iPad app that has a button.\r\nAttach code to the button that creates a UITableViewController and make that table view controller the content controller for a UIPopverController.\r\n\r\nCreate the UIPopoverController and give the UITableViewController a preferred height that would cause it to be lower than the edge of the screen or the top edge of the keyboard if that's showing.\r\n\r\nCall presentPopoverFromRect:fromView:animated, passing in the bounds of the button, the button and YES/NO as the parameters.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIPopoverController should be drawn such that the arrow points to the specified rect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIPopoverController is drawn with the arrow pointing to some random place higher than the rect. Note the X value of the arrow is valid, the Y value is wrong.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've provided screenshots on iOS8 and IOS9 for this bug, as well as the sample project. Run the sample project on IOS8, then run it on iOS9 and compare the results. Note that the arrow is drawn in the wrong place on iOS9."
