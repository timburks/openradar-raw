    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a Mac App Store URL on the web (in Safari) is loaded, and the URL has a referral parameter but no \"mt=12\" argument, the referenced App Store product is attempted to be opened in iTunes on the Mac instead of in the App Store app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari on Mac.\r\n2. Paste this URL into the address bar:\r\n\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnigraffle-6/id711830901?at=10l4LD\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe App Store app should open and bring the selected app into focus. Whatever the parameters to the URL, if the item in question is a Mac app, it should always trigger opening in the App Store and not in iTunes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes opens and yields a cryptic error about the item \"not being currently available in the US store.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 2.0 (376.28)\r\n10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nThe issue also occurs on El Capitan betas.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
