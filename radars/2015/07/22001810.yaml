    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen installing components via the commandline using\r\n\r\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode -installComponents\r\n\r\nXcode will still load third party plugins, opening the dialog for user approval for those if it is a new version. This makes unattended installation impossible if any third party plugins are present. It would be better for Xcode to just ignore and not load third party plugins in this scenario.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install any third party Xcode plugin\r\n2. Download a new version of Xcode\r\n3. Run /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode -installComponents\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode installs components without user interaction.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode pops up the third party plugin approval dialog.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis worked in previous versions, because the approval dialog was added in 6.3.2 - while it is a welcome addition, it breaks this scenario.\r\n\r\nNotes: -"
