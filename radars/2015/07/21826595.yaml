        Summary:
        I used ‘ibtool [name_of_xib].xib --generate-strings-file /path/to/existing/[name_of_xib].strings’ and tried to view the changes in Xcode’s comparison viewer.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        0) Create an Xcode project with either a storyboard or xib, and place it under version control
        1) For the .xib, under inspector, ensure that you have pressed “Localize…” to bring the .xib under Base.lproj
        2) Add a .strings file to an internationalized xib by selecting a language (let’s say English). This generates a [name_of_xib].strings under en.lproj
        3) Go back to the .xib in IB, and change one of the strings to a different value
        4) Open Terminal.app and navigate to the location of the .xib you just modified
        5) Run ‘ibtool [name_of_xib].xib --generate-strings-file ../en.lproj/[name_of_xib].strings’
        6) Back in Xcode look at the modified .strings file
        7) Open the comparison editor to see the changes

        Expected Results:
        The comparison editor will show the changed string from the xib.

        Actual Results:
        The “previous” editor shows garbage (chinese characters for me), rather than the original .strings (see attachment)

        Notes:
        Perhaps this is related to UTF-8 or UTF-16 parsing? IIRC .strings files are supposed to be in UTF-16 format.
