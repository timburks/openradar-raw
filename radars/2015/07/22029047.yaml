        Summary:
        Although the forum is shiny and new, i don’t find it intuitive. A basic use-case is to find a thread i created, and it is non-obvious how to find them.
        In the end, I found it in “Content -> Authored”. To find that, i looked through Activity, Content and Search and found several issues related to them.

        Activity: First off, i thought this is related to my activities and i would find there my own created threads, so the wording is a bit irritating. “Keep up to date on topcis that interest you” - so this is basically a filter over all threads, filtered by… magic? The posts that are shown there aren’t interesting for me. I think that might be a useful feature, but as long as it shows garbage and doesn’t tell me how to improve it, it’s useless. “Connections Stream” does a much better job, as it doesn’t show any results yet but explains me what to do (“Just look around for people and places that are important to you, and follow them.”). But then, what is the difference of Connections Stream and Activity in the end, and do they need to be separated, if both are there to show me threads related to my interests?

        Conent: Again, the wording is irritating. The functionality is great, but i would never search that functionality under “Content” - for me, this is a search-view and looks like what i would have expected under “Search”.

        Search: Unlike Activity and Content, it opens a popover that says “Search Communities”. I am in the “Apple Developer Forums”, as it is told me by the website, and now i have a search-field that searches in communities. What is the difference from the forums to the communities? Is it the same? Then you start typing and get instant results inside the popover - nice. When i start typing “test”, it shows me some results and says “5 more”. I hit enter and get a view that is overall different from the rest of the forum. And there are much more results than the five it showed me instantly and the +5 and showed me in the popover. When i filter on “Search for Content”, i also get a table at the right side with “Places”, when i set “Search for” to Places i get a table on the right side with People, but i can not set “Search for” to people. Um… what? What are “External activities”? Trying some other words than “test” (iOS, UITextView), I’m not getting results. What am i expect to see here?
        Again, the functionality might be great, but i really don’t understand whats going on here. And where should i look at when i search for something specific? In “Content” or in “Search” or do i have to do it in both?

        What i would like to see is something this:
        In “Activity”, my own posts are shown first, then there are the Activity-stream and Connections-stream (either by using multiple columns, or using any kind of navigation)
        Content should be renamed to “Search” and may get some of the functionality that currently is in Search.
