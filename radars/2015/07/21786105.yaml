        Summary:
        If you create a string that has the same unicode flag repeated three times, those three flags will be a single Character. This doesn’t seem to match the behavior described in the Swift Programming Language book:

        “Every instance of Swift’s Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a string containing the following unicode code points: 1F1FA, 1F1F8, 1F1FA, 1F1F8, 1F1FA, 1F1F8
        2. Access the first entry in that string’s character array

        Expected Results:
        It should be a single US flag

        Actual Results:
        It is three US flags

        Regression:

        Notes:
        I’ve attached a playground demonstrating this behavior.
