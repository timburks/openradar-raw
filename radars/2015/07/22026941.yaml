    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Passbook it is currently possible to drag Apple Pay cards and re-order them. On the watch and in the Watch app for iOS there is currently no way to reorder cards which makes it problematic if you have 7 cards and want to use the last one. You would need to double tap the side button on your watch and swipe 7 times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd multiple cards to Apple Pay on the watch.\r\nAttempt to drag and reorder.\r\nCannot reorder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to drag cards in the Apple Watch app and reorder them\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to reorder\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCurrently the only workaround is to delete and re-add cards in the desired order."
