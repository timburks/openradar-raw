        Summary:
        The "choose a template for your new file" dialog that is presented for File > New > File should pre-select iOS/OS X based on current project type

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode and create a new iOS project
        2. Use "File > New > File" to create a new file in the project

        Expected Results:
        it should preselect iOS based on the the type of the project

        Actual Results:
        it preselects based on the type of the last file that was created, OS X if none was created so far. This sometimes leads to confusion with beginners who are not familiar with the dialog.
