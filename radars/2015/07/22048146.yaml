    description: "Summary:\r\nMore and more manufacturers of groceries switch from GTIN (aka UPC) to GS1-128 because next to the product code they can include a best-before date. AVFoundation's metadata object detector has a serious issue with these Code128 barcodes as it does not recognize them. At least not in the range of quality that can be found on product packages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Print out the provided barcode\r\n2. Try to scan it with a AVCaptureMetadataOutput set up to detect AVMetadataObjectTypeCode128Code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The metadata object should be delivered\r\n- It's content's should be (01)09002233023062(15)150720\r\n\r\nIn this case 01 is the product GTIN\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- No metadata object is delivered to the delegate\r\n- ... regardless of how you rotate the device around\r\n- the crummy zBar app (free on app store) is able to detect it and opens a google search for 9002233023062\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 (13A4305g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a severe problem because this weakness still exists in iOS 9 making the iPhone effectively unusable for scanning GS1-128 barcodes which are getting more and more prevalent in Europe.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
