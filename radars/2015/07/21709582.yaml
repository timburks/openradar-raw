        In Swift, NSString methods are generally available on String, but NSString(bytes:length:encoding) is not, and leads to surprising behavior:

        let data = [UInt8]([65])
        let string = String(bytes: data, length: data.count, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
        let nsstring = NSString(bytes: data, length: data.count, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding) as? String


        “string” is of type String and is “([65], 1,4)” because it is interpreted as a tuple and passed to String(_ instance:).

        “nsstring” is of type String? containing Some(“A”) (as expected)
