    description: "Summary:\r\nI have various stretchable, 9-part images in my app that are no longer displaying correctly when I build for iOS 9 (or OS X 10.11). The same image assets displayed correctly in iOS 8 (and OS X 10.10). Depending on the image, it may show certain slices as being lighter or darker than they should be. I have attached a sample app demonstrating this as well as two screenshots:\r\n\r\niOS 8: The button displays perfectly, even when pressed.\r\niOS 9: When the app targets iOS 9, the bug is especially apparent when the button is pressed, though it's present even when it is not pressed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample app on iOS 9.\r\n2. Examine the button's background image.\r\n3. Hold down the button and examine the background image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should be a rounded rectangle with a light grey, even colored background. The rectangle should have a hairline (1pt), darker grey stroke around it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeither the background nor the stroke is an even color—various sections are lighter or darker than they should be.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 3 (13A4293g) and Xcode 7 beta 3 (7A152u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug was also present in iOS 9 beta 2, and I believe it was in the first beta too—though I'm not 100% positive. As noted in the description, a very similar problem is also present in the OS X 10.11 betas—see rdar://21735415\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that if I set the deployment target to iOS 8 then the problem goes away, even in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, AT&T, 64GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SlicedImagesiOS.zip' was successfully uploaded."
