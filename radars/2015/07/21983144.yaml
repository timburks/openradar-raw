    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a new tab, the filename displayed in the tab does not change when another file is opened in the same tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open or create a project\r\n2. Close all tabs (if any are open)\r\n3. Create a new tab via CMD + TAB. The name of the current file is displayed correctly.\r\n4. Click on another file in the navigator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe name of the newly selected file is displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe name of the previous file is displayed. If you select other files the name of the original file remains displayed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis makes it quite confusing to navigate around projects when you’re not necessarily sure what file is open by glancing at the tab. The breadcrumb (?) menu underneath displays the right name but isn’t as glanceable."
