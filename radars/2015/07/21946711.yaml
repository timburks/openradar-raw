        In Beta 4, NSURLSession can fail when connecting to a server via HTTPS and that meets the TLSv1.2 requirement

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the test case in the attached project

        Expected Results:
        All 3 requests should succeed

        Actual Results:
        Only request to https://apple.com succeeds, even though the other two servers meet the new requirements

        This was working in Beta 3

        Notes:
        iOS B4 is also affected
