        Summary:
        Sometimes itâ€™s necessary that a view controller knows if it is in a popover. Apple requires this functionality as well and has a private helper that looks at the nearest presentation controller to determine if it is presented as popover.

        There should be a public way to determine just this. The current UIPresentationController API is a great step forward, yet it is hard to determine how a controller is *actually* presented on screen, after potential applied adaptivity.

        For a full discussion, please read my blog post about it:
