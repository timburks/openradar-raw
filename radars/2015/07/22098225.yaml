    description: "Although NSArray and NSOrderedSet have method indexOfObject:inSortedRange:options:usingComparator:, there is no such method in Swift Array.\r\n\r\nBy now there are two options to bypass this problem:\r\n1) Implement your own binary search method. You can find more on this here http://stackoverflow.com/a/26679191/1722840. \r\n2) Bridge Swift Array to NSArray and use Foundation method. Though such bridging may be slow (described here: http://swiftdoc.org/swift-2/type/Array/)\r\n\r\nConsidering all the available options it would be only natural to have such method in Swift."
