    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling fontWithSize: method on a system font returned from systemFontOfSize:weight: returns a font which has a different font name (and weight) than the original one, unless the weight is Regular or Medium. This affects both iOS 8.2+ and iOS 9 beta 4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReproducing on iOS 8.4:\r\n1. Retrieve a system font of weight UIFontWeightLight and size 20. Returned font is \".HelveticaNeueInterface-Light\".\r\n2. Call fontWithSize on the returned font to retrieve the same font, but with size 25.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nfontWithSize returns a font \".HelveticaNeueInterface-Light\" with size 25.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nfontWithSize returns a font \".HelveticaNeueInterface-Regular\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 and newer, including iOS 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo work around this issue, one can use this instead:\r\nnewFont = [UIFont fontWithDescriptor:font.fontDescriptor size:25];\r\nwhere \"font\" is the original font and 25 is the new point size necessary.\r\n\r\nAttached project contains a \"testbed\" of different system fonts passed through fontWithSize and through the workaround above. It shows that on both iOS 8.2+ and iOS 9 beta 4 (which has different system font families) fontWithSize works incorrectly with many system font weights, while the workaround works correctly for all weights.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny hardware or simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SystemLightFontDemo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
