    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 7 beta 4's SDK, nullability markers were added to SecKeychainFindGenericPassword, indicating that the passwordLength parameter is *not* nullable. In current documentation and in previous OS releases, the argument was specifically documented as being required to be NULL when passwordData (which is now marked nullable) is NULL:\r\n\r\n\"Pass NULL if you want to obtain the item object but not the password data. In this case, you must also pass NULL in the passwordLength parameter.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beta 4 SDK's header file for SecKeychain.h, the caveat about setting passwordLength to NULL has been removed.\r\n\r\nIs it Apple's intention that clients of this function should be required to pass a non-null passwordLength even though they are not asking for passwordData? If so, can Apple confirm that passing a non-null argument in these circumstances is safe when the resulting code runs on 10.10.5 and earlier OS releases?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0 beta 4 (7A165t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
