    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8.3 and below the Music app would not play songs marked \"Skip when Shuffling\", in the iTunes library, when you have shuffle enabled on the iOS device.\r\nIn iOS 8.4 it adds these songs to the shuffle list anyway.\r\niTunes 12.2 still adheres to this setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Mark a song(s) as \"Skip when Shuffling\" in the iTunes library. (Get Info -> Options -> Playback)\r\n2. Sync with device\r\n3. Shuffle all in Music app. Either by Siri (\"play all music shuffled\") or selecting a song with the shuffle option enabled already.\r\n4. Check Up Next or press next until you see the song(s) from step one in the results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe songs marked \"Skip when Shuffling\" in iTunes should be skipped while shuffling in the iOS Music app also.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe songs marked \"Skip when Shuffling\" in iTunes are included in the shuffled music list in the iOS Music app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 32GB [ME344LL/A]\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
