        Summary:
        With the deprecation of MPMoviePlayerController, the only option to play video inline is AVPlayerViewController. However, being a UIViewController subclass comes with a lot of limitations. It is the UIViewController montra that views should not know about their view controllers. However, anything that wants to show an inline video has to have a reference to it’s view controller. For instance, if you wanted to display a video in a table view or collection view cell, or in a “rich text“ view that allows video embeds.

        Further, giving a view controller authority over the view controllers view gets very confusing when that view controller goes full screen. At this point, is it the containers responsibility to set that frame? What happens if it does from a routine layoutSubviews call?
