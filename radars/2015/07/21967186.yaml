        Summary:
        If I try to create a new screen recording and then a new movie recording using keyboard shortcuts, QuickTime Player crashes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Enable iCloud Drive, so that newly opened apps will show a file picker dialog by default.
        2. Open QuickTime Player. You should see the Open dialog box because you have no files open.
        3. Type Command-Control-N (New Screen Recording)
        4. Realize you misremembered the keyboard shortcut for New Movie Recording, and immediately press Command-Option-N before the Screen Recording window has had time to appear.

        Expected Results:
        If I do these shortcuts slowly, one after the other, I get a screen recording window and a movie recording window, so that’s what I would expect to happen.

        Actual Results:
        Crash.

        Notes:
        Doesn’t happen if you don’t have iCloud Drive enabled, because the file picker doesn’t open by default.
