        Summary:
        The personal hotspot section in the WiFI dropdown shows a network label, signal strength and battery status for nearby personal hotspots. This appears to be private / undocumented API.

        At yourkarma.com we would like to offer a consistent user experience by showing the same information for our hotspots in the WiFi dropdown. Using the NEHotspotHelper APIs we can make the experience just as seamless as it is now with tethering.

        Expected Results:

        Actual Results:
