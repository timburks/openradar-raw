        With the excellent addition of “defer” to Swift, this seems like the perfect opportunity to also offer an @defer directive in Objective-C.  This is actually simple enough to express currently as a macro in Objective-C, but built in compiler support would provide the powerful construct as a built in feature of the language just like Swift has.  Below I’ve outlined how one must go about doing a defer today in Objective-C (which requires a header include/import) and how making @defer a directive would be a very natural addition to the language.


        // some helper declarations

        #define _custom_macro_concat(a, b) a##b
        #define custom_macro_concat(a, b) _custom_macro_concat(a, b)
        typedef void(^custom_defer_block_t)();
        NS_INLINE void custom_deferFunc(__strong custom_defer_block_t *blockRef)
        {
            custom_defer_block_t actualBlock = *blockRef;
            actualBlock();
        }


        // the core macro

        #define custom_defer(deferBlock) \
        __strong custom_defer_block_t custom_macro_concat(__custom_stack_defer_block_, __LINE__) __attribute__((cleanup(custom_deferFunc), unused)) = deferBlock

        // use via macro in code

        #include <custom_defer.h>

        - (void)foo
        {
            FILE *file = fopen(…);
            custom_defer(^{
                if (file) {
                    fclose(file);
                }
            });

            // continue code where any stack exit will lead to the defer being executed
        }

        // if we had an @defer directive instead

        - (void)foo
        {
            FILE *file = fopen(…);
            @defer(^{
                if (file) {
                    fclose(file);
                }
            });

            // continue code where any stack exit will lead to the defer being executed
        }
