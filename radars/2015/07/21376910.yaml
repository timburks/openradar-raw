    description: "Summary:\r\nThe only way to disable Siri voice feedback in iOS 9 is to mute the device. There should be an option to disable always, like in iOS 8. Feedback takes extra time while Siri reads the feedback, if someone is a frequent Siri user, this can add up to a lot of time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn iPhone, go to Settings > General > Siri > Audio Feedback\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee an option \"Always Off\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly options are \"Always On\" and \"Control with Ring Switch\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 Beta 3"
