    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the iOS Simulator for iOS 9 beta 4, it's possible to attempt to access the App Store via Spotlight, even though the App Store isn't available on the Simulator. This results in being presented an empty view controller. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Spotlight in the iOS Simulator\r\n2. Search for an app in the App Store. Example: \"Tweetbot\"\r\n3. Spotlight will pull up an App Store link and a button to \"View\" the app in the App Store.\r\n4. An empty view controller loads. The \"Cancel\" button to exit out of the App Store view controller may or may not appear. And the status bar looks messed up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the App Store isn't available on the Simulator, Spotlight shouldn't display App Store links at all. Alternatively, Spotlight could display App Store links, but tapping the links shouldn't do anything.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTapping an App Store link in Spotlight pulls up an empty view controller with a messed up status bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 beta 4 on OS X El Capitan beta 4"
