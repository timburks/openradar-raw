        Summary:
        Many OS X users use their system ruby installations every day, whether they know it or not. With El Cap, thereâ€™s a great opportunity to migrate to a newer system ruby version, ideally 2.2.2, which is the most recent version of MRI. Ruby 2.0.0  (the current system ruby version) is at this point only receiving security updates, and its release series is over two years old. Ruby 2.2 includes many improvements to the ruby language, in addition to the promise of being supported for longer, and will enable developers to target new features that have been added in the past couple of years.
