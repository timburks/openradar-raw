    description: |-
        Chaining + to create an Array rapidly leads to very slow compile times. For example, this compiles very quickly (~1s in a playground)

        var y = [1]
        y += [2]
        y += [3]
        y += [4]

        This compiles very slowly (several seconds in a playground):

        let x = [1] + [2] + [3] + [4]

        Adding another + increases the time dramatically.
