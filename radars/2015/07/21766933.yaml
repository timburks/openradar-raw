    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease enhance the AVPictureInPictureController API to provide the ability to pass an instance of AVSynchronizedLayer along with the AVPlayerLayer. Our application relies heavily on the use of AVSynchronizedLayer to deliver Core Animation effects synched to our video timeline. This capability is essential to our video playback experience and the current lack of support for AVSynchronizedLayer in AVPictureInPictureController prohibits our use of this useful new feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad"
