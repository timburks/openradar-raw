    description: "Developers need some way to better communicate with customers and customers deserve a better way for us to communicate with them when they have trouble. Many customers put their complaints into an iTunes review as they do not know or cannot find any other avenue (even if others do actually exist). Those complaints are basically impossible for anyone to do anything about and it leaves the customer feeling abandoned while the developer feels betrayed having their app store entry sullied by (perhaps unfounded) bad reviews.\r\n\r\n- anyone who downloads any app should be able to leave a star rating\r\n\r\n- if the app is 100% free (no IAP), anyone who has downloaded the app can leave a written review\r\n\r\n- if an app is not 100% free, only a user who has actually purchased an item for actual money (IAP or otherwise) can leave a written review\r\n\r\n- developers should be able to respond to written reviews - the responses are private by default, however if the user who gets the response so chooses, they may flag the developerâ€™s response as public and it is then attached to their public review in the store\r\n\r\n- developers should have a button attached to review responses which allows them to refund the customer along with their response if they choose, and if the developer issues a refund, it also *deletes* the associated review. the customer can no longer leave a new review for the app unless they purchase the app (or some IAP for it) again later"
