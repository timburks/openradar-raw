    description: "Summary:\r\nThe status bar on top of the screen collides with the search bar after a rotation has been completed in a view on the stack somewhere after the search bar's parent view was on screen. Our assumption is that it may collide with the feature of automatically hiding the status bar in landscape mode in iOS8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start the provided sample application in portrait orientation and type in any search text producing search results.\r\n\r\n2. Select any search result from the resulting table view. Rotate the device to landscape left or right orientation\r\n\r\n3. After the screen rotated to the new landscape orientation tap back to root view controller.\r\n\r\n4. Rotate back to portrait\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the exact same layout of the search bar under the status bar as it was before I left the view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe status bar is on top of the search bar (or the search bar is below the status bar) creating an obviously ugly looking UI. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUI is incorrect\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Sample-UISearchController.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nSample Project:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/b3qdyi2ift6ni8c/Sample-UISearchController.zip?dl=0"
