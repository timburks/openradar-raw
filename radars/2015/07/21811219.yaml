Setup a project and give it the name \"Parent & Child\"\r\n2. Select launchscreen.xib\r\n3. Observer error\r\n4. Attempt to build and see failed build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject should build and LaunchScreen.xib should be editable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError is displayed and project will not build\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.4 (6E35b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccuring on Macbook Pro running Xcode 6.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-07-14 at 10.51.30.png' was successfully uploaded."
