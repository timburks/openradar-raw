    description: "Summary:\r\nAny place in Swift where there’s a comma-delimited list should allow a comma after the last item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Xcode 6.4/Swift 1.2 as well as Xcode 7b3/Swift 2.0, entering:\r\nvar goatTuple = ( \"\U0001F410\", \"\U0001F410\", \"\U0001F410\" )\r\nworks while \r\nvar goatTuple = ( \"\U0001F410\", \"\U0001F410\", \"\U0001F410\", )\r\nproduces an error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth above examples should work.  Commas after last items in any comma-delimited list should not produce errors.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCommas after last items in at least some instances of comma-delimited lists (tuples) produce errors.  I haven’t checked to see whether trailing commas like this are permitted anywhere."
