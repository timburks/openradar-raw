    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring my usual walk (about 6.3 kilometers) I saw the distance suddenly jump to 24,05 km. I was walking with my iPhone in my back pocket listening to a podcast.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nabout 8124, according to a later workout, though I don't know what combination of factors lead to this jump. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe same round - done a day afterwards - yielded these expected results:\r\n\r\n- outdoor walk\r\n- 272 active calories outdoor walk,\r\n- total time 1:07:12\r\n6.3 kilometers\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- outdoor walk\r\n- 289 active calories\r\n- total time 1:17:20, \r\n- total distance 25.99 kilometers  <- totally insane\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI suspect that you'd get a result like this if Core Location loses precision dramatically. There should be some sanity checking where the distance travelled is totally unrealistic compared to mode of locomotion, i.e. I could not possibly have walked 26 kilometers but only used 289 Calories and also not in 77 minutes."
