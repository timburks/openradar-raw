    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting in 10.11, apps that (ab)use -[NSApplication beginSheet:modalForWindow:modalDelegate:didEndSelector:contextInfo:]  by passing a nil window value have their panels displayed, but they become undismissable, presumably because of some change in the way the modal panel loop operates in this condition.\r\n\r\nI've observed this \"in the wild\" with two shipping apps including VoodooPad and Apple's own Safari shipping with 10.11 (see Radar #21981467).\r\n\r\nEven though the method is deprecated, and the parameter is apparently not intended to ever be nil, it has behaved historically as a standalone modal panel presenter when the window parameter is nil. To avoid a lot of \"hung\" apps that must be force-quit because of this issue, the existing behavior should be preserved until this method is outright removed from the frameworks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Build and run.\r\n3. Click the button to display the panel.\r\n4. Click either cancel or save buttons on the panel.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe panel should be dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe panel remains visible and can't be dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 Beta (15A226f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ModalMishaps.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nApple closed the bug on 7/28/2015: Behaves as Intended."
