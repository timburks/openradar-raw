        Summary:
        It would be nice if we could have one protocol conform to another protocol through a protocol extension that provides default implementations of the other protocol’s methods. This can be done by having the original declaration of the first protocol, but it seems cleaner to have the conformance noted as part of the protocol extension, to keep that localized to the implementations of the protocol’s methods.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a protocol ProtocolOne
        2. Create a protocol ProtocolTwo
        3. Add an extension of ProtocolTwo that inherits from ProtocolOne and provides implementations of all of its methods

        Expected Results:
        It would compile, and anything that implemented ProtocolTwo would be known at compile time to conform to ProtocolOne

        Actual Results:
        The code will not compile, because protocol extensions cannot have inheritance clauses.

        Regression:
