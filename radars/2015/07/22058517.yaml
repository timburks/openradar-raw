    description: "Summary:\r\nIf there is an invalid plist key in a WatchOS 2 App target, the app will install but the developer will receive a vague UIAlertView on iOS stating \"Cannot Install Watch App\".\r\n\r\nIf \"Build & Run\" is clicked again, a second error will appear in Xcode:\r\n\r\n     Error Launching 'TestApp WatchKit App Extension'\r\n     Installation error. Check the iPhone console for more details.\"\r\n\r\n(See attached screenshots)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Xcode project with a WatchKit app target\r\n2. Add the following to the info.plist of the watchOS *app* target:\r\n\r\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\r\n<dict>\r\n\t<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n</dict>\r\n\r\n3. Build and run.\r\n\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Open attached sample project \"FooProject\"\r\n2. Build and run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should propagate \"validateWatchKitApplicationInfoDictionary\" errors up to the developer. They should not need to look into the console logs to find this error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser has to go into the app console logs to find the plist error and run their app. See the attached log.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode-beta (7A165t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/q/31641162/5158230\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Xcode project with a WatchOS 2 app target containing an invalid key it's info.plist. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'FooProject.zip', 'Screen Shot 2015-07-26 at 2.56.07 PM.png', 'Simulator Screen Shot Jul 26, 2015, 2.56.55 PM.png', 'Simulator Screen Shot Jul 26, 2015, 2.55.41 PM.png' and 'WatchKit_2015_07_29_16_32_12-0400.log' were successfully uploaded."
