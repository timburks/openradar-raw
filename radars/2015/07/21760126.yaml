    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari View Controller, there are five buttons in the bottom toolbar, the fifth being a button to open the page being displayed in Safari.\r\n\r\nHowever, Settings > General > Restrictions includes a setting to disable Safari. When Safari is disabled here, the button ceases to function but still appears normally, in the tint color provided to SFSafariViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an instance of SFSafariViewController in an app targeted for iOS 9.0.\r\n2. Install the app in Simulator or on a compatible device and trigger the SFSafariViewController.\r\n3. Exit the app and go to Settings > General > Restrictions.\r\n4. Disable Safari.\r\n5. Exit Settings and repeat steps 1 and 2.\r\n6. Observe the \"Open in Safari\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen Safari is disabled in Restrictions, the \"Open in Safari\" button in Safari View Controller would be grayed out or hidden entirely.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button still appears as it would when Safari is not disabled (but it doesn't open Safari). The button appears as if it works but does nothingâ€”silent failure.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 [13A4293g]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'll reiterate that the button does not open Safari in spite of the Restrictions setting. It simply appears as if it would do something, then doesn't do that something.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus 64GB U.S. Cellular (iPhone7,1)"
