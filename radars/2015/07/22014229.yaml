    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen selecting a song in a playlist in album view, cmd+a would select all songs in that album. Since iTunes 12.2 this no longer works. It does work in any other view (song list or artist) or when not in a playlist (e.g. in the main library).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new playlist, set its display to album view.\r\n2. Add a few songs from an album to that view.\r\n3. Open the album by clicking.\r\n4. Select a song by clicking.\r\n5. Press the cmd+a shortcut\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the songs from the album are selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe selection does not change.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.2.1.16 (On OS X 10.10)"
