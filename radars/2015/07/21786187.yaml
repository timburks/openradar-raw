        Summary:
        Until updating to OSX 10.11 pressing Cmd+1 activated the first item in the “Favorites” items. The item in the menu is still labeled with the shortcut, but now Safari just switches to the first tab. See attached screenshot.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * have multiple tabs open
        * have multiple items in the “Favorites” menu
        * select another tab then the first
        * press Cmd+1

        Expected Results:
        * first item in the Favorite item opened

        Actual Results:
        * first tab activated

        Regression:
        This worked with Safari 8.0
