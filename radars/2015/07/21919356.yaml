    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a Samsung U28D590 4K Display is attached to the Retina iMac in , dragging any window will result in serious graphics corruption inside the dragged window’s frame. The corruption will only go away when the window redraws.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Obtain an iMac15,1 with Intel Core i7 and AMD Radeon R9 M295X\r\n2. Attach a Samsung U28D590 4K Display to the iMac using a standard MiniDisplayPort to DisplayPort cable\r\n3. Set the display to extend the screen\r\n4. Set the Resolution to be “Scaled, looks like 2560x1440”\r\n5. Drag any window into the screen, and/or drag one around inside it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window will drag around smoothly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window frame is filled with vertical and horizontal stripes, mostly in the colours of the desktop background image.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem does not occur in native scaling mode. It does occur in “Looks like 2560x1440” scaling mode, and it does occur in any other scaled mode as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a"
