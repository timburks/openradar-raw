    description: "Summary:\r\nSigning out of the iTunes Store and back in causes the songs and albums added to my Library from Apple Music to get stuck in a limbo. The songs are still considered to be in my library and I can't add them, but they also don't appear anywhere, so I can't remove them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add tracks to \"My Music\".\r\n2. Sign out of iTunes.\r\n3. Sign back into iTunes using the same Apple ID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tracks I added should still be displayed as part of My Music, or alternatively, the tracks are not included in My Music and instead are able to be added again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tracks are not displayed. If you navigate back to the song in Apple Music, the song is shown as already being part of My Music, and so the option to add it is not displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Mavericks 10.10.4, iTunes 12.2.1.16"
