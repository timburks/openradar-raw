    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no indication whether an episode of a show has been watched or not in the HBO NOW app on Apple TV. This makes it difficult to determine which episode of a series is the “next unwatched” of that season. \r\n\r\nNetflix shows a checkmark next to shows which have been watched and Hulu shows a blue dot next to unwatched shows. Either of these patterns is fine.\r\n\r\nNot showing any watched/unwatched state forces the user to drill down on episodes and read descriptions to find the unwatched shows. This can be error-prone as the following episode after the “next unwatched” show is usually also unwatched and this type of exploration causes spoilers. Heck, even reading the show descriptions can spoil the plot. So, can we get a dot, or not?"
