    description: "The elderly man/woman emoji used to depict a white man and woman with white/grey hair, identifying them either as elderly, or extreme Steve Martin fans.\n\nEmoji changes were introduced in iOS 8.3 and OS X El Capitan, and I get the intent of the changes, but they may have gone a bit too far, in that these two icons no longer look like elderly people, but more like terrible Simpsons characters. (Hell, even Marge has BLUE hair.)\n\nIs the end-user intended to pull out a magnifying glass, and count the microscopic wrinkles on the emoji characters, so that theyâ€™ll understand they represent elderly people?\n\n\U0001F474\U0001F475\n\nPossible Solutions:\n\n* Give them grey hair again. As far as I know, people of every race, creed and color tend to get gray hair as they age.\n* Give them glasses. Elderly people tend to have poor eyesight.\n* Place their heads on the body of an owl. Owls are wise and so are elderly people.\n\nSome of these solutions are as ridiculous as making their hair yellow. ;-)"
