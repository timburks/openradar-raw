    description: "Summary:\n\nWhile migrating PSPDFKit to the new UISearchController API, we noticed a few issues with implicit animations. \n\nOn iOS 9b2:\n- the search bar placeholder text doesn't animate from center alignment to left alignment the first time search is invoked (works fine afterwards though)\n- the table view row deselection on the searchResultsController is abrupt instead of animated (as observable on a regular UITableViewController with clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear enabled - the default configuration)\n\nOn iOS 8, the search bar placeholder animation works, the however the deselection does not occur at all.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nExtract the attached archive. The animations can be observed in the attached GIF (recorded on iOS 9).\nThe archive also contains a slightly modified version of the Apple TableSearch example. The only changes made were 1.) adding a launch storyboard for proper display on iPhone 6 and commenting a line that immediately deselected the selected cell (commented with a “//PSPDFKit” prefixed comment). \n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe placeholder text would always animate & the selected row deselection would be animated like usual for UITableViewController. \n\nActual Results:\n\nSee Summary. \n\nRegression:\n\niOS 9.0b2, iOS 8.4, iPhone and iPad."
