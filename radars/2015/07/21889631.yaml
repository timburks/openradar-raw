    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes doesn't update the iCloud status of songs that are matched to Apple Music after subscribing to iTunes Match, so redownloads of the songs are still on a DRM-laden format.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a new iTunes library from scratch with a new iCloud account\r\n2. Add ripped music to the library (MP3 or AAC)\r\n3. Start a free trial of Apple Music. iCloud Status of the songs should change to \"Apple Music\"\r\n4. Subscribe to iTunes Match. iCloud Status is still \"Apple Music\"\r\n5. Delete a song\r\n6. Redownload the song\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe song redownloaded should come back DRM-free\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe song redownloaded is with FairPlay DRM\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.2.1.16 on OS X 10.10.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems the issue still occurs when adding a new ripped song to iTunes. Logging out and then logging in or turning iCloud Music Library doesn't fix the problem\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis issue occurs always when subscribing to iTunes Match when the user already has a Apple Music subscription\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
