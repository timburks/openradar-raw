    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter uploading a preview video and selecting a start frame I can no longer edit the screenshots because Safari aborts loading the m3u8 file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload a preview video for an app version\r\n2. Save and log out\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- when you log into this iTunes Connect account and view the app version I expect to see the video preview image\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- the screen shots panel is blocked and a spinner spins forever\r\n- on the Safari console there is an error message about the blocked resource as being \"insecure\":\r\n\r\n[blocked] The page at https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/951069441 was not allowed to display insecure content from http://a505.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/PurpleVideo5/v4/52/59/71/52597163-0cec-9c4e-68af-55ab65b87fd6/P37072163_default.m3u8.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari  9.0 (10601.1.35.2.4) on OS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is no known workaround at the moment, which means that this effectively disables editing of the screen shots via the web interface."
