        Whenever I update iOS apps from within my OS X iTunes, I get a dialog that asks “Require password for additional purchases on this computer?” with options “Require after 15 minutes” and “Always require”.

        This is strange for two reasons:

        1) First, it’s not in the context of a purchase. I’m not adding any new apps and have not entered my AppleID password.

        2) Second, the dialog always appears twice.

        Both effects are 100% reproducible for me. Please let me know what other info I can provide.
