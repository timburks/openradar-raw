    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently my process for beta testing Mac apps involves collecting hardware UUIDs from my testers, registering them in the developer portal, and then sending out a development build using Microsoft's HockeyApp. Now that I'm adding CloudKit, there's an additional frustration: my testers will only be able to access CloudKit's development environment. They won't be able to sync with iOS unless I also send out my iOS betas using HockeyApp. (Since submitting a build for TestFlight gives no option to select the development environment.)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, they won't be able to sync with any device using a non-beta version of the app. This is less of a problem, but it will make it harder to catch problems that could arise when a customer tries to sync a new version of my app with an older one.\r\n\r\nPlus in general it would just be awfully nice to get all the TestFlight benefits that we have on iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
