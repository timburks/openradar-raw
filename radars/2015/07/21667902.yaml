    description: "When advertising on OS X using MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser and [_nearbyServiceAdvertiser startAdvertisingPeer] the wifi speeds on my Mac drop dramatically.\r\n\r\nI've tested this on both the new 12\" MacBook and 2012 15\" Retina MacBook Pro, both experience the issue but the 12\" MacBook's speeds drop far worse to an almost unusable amount."
