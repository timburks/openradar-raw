    description: "Summary:\r\nI need to be able to navigate a user to a web page that is the result of a POST request. Currently, SFSafariViewController can only navigate to URLs that are the result of a GET request. This would also provide API parity with UIWebView and WKWebView.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCurrently, the only way to display the result of POST requests is UIWebView, as WKWebView still does not support POST requests (radr://18404188)."
