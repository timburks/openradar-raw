    description: "Summary:\r\nBuffalo has a flyover it is the 73rd largest city\r\nPittsburgh is the 62nd.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh also has the most Bridges in the world (Yes, larger than Venice)\r\n\r\nPittsburgh has an Apple Engineering Site. Buffalo (I think) doesn't have one.\r\n\r\nC'mon.. Share the love\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun Maps\r\nFlyover Pittsburgh, with 3D\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the grandeur of a lovely city with a fantastic skyline. The allure of the two stadiums that are side-by-side. Enjoy the vistas and hills. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFlat.. Boring.. behind other major cities\r\n\r\nDisappointing to a LONG time Apple developer\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8; OS 10.10 betas\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nObviously this is not a technical request or a really meaty one.\r\n\r\nBut I know the drill. If not requested it is unlikely to be randomly done.\r\n\r\nSO... requested. Please do not make me call out the guard in Pittsburgh to flood you with requests ;)"
