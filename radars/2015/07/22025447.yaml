    description: "Summary:\r\nEarlier today, I needed a copy of the OS X 10.8 \"Mountain Lion\" installer to test some older software that had not been updated to run correctly on Mavericks or Yosemite. I attempted to download the installer from the Purchases tab of the Mac App Store on my late 2013 Mac Pro, only to be met with a message that 10.8 wouldn't run on that Mac.\r\n\r\nI knew this. My intent was to run the installer on another machine that was better suited for the older OS, but to use my newer Mac for the download while I finished some other work. However, the Mac App Store prevented me from downloading the installer in a convenient way; I needed to find another piece of hardware that was suited to run the older OS first and download it there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Mac App Store on a late 2013 Mac Pro.\r\n2. Click the Purchases tab. (Make sure you're signed into an account that purchased OS X 10.8.)\r\n3. Find the 10.8 installer in the purchases list. Click Download.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe installer downloads to /Applications, where I can move it to another machine or do whatever I want with it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Mac App Store pops up an error message: \"We could not complete your purchase. OS X Mountain Lion is not compatible with this computer.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.4 (14E46) / App Store Version 2.0 (376.28)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2013 Mac Pro."
