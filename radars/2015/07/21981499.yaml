    description: "I ran into a situation in which the sync process with my iPhone 6 Plus just hung at the \"importing photos\" stage.\r\n\r\nPer a suggestion in one of the Apple Support Community forums, checking \"import videos\" enabled the sync process to complete.\r\n\r\nI did have ONE video in ONE photo album so maybe that was the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI was syncing with the Photos app, not iPhoto I don't know exactly how to reproduce this but I did have ONE video in ONE photo album when performing the sync. In fact, that album ONLY has one item: the video, if that helps in reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\nSo steps might be:\r\n\r\n1. Create an album in Photos\r\n2. Add one video to the album\r\n3. Check the album in iTunes to sync with iPhone\r\n4. Sync with iPhone (BTW this worked for me before... not sure why... maybe a previous version of iTunes didn't care?)\r\n5. Attempt sync again.... sync hangs."
