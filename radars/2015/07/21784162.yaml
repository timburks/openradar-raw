        Summary:
        Previous versions of watchOS properly provided continuous taptic feedback when a timer went off. Now, only a single tap can be felt, which is easily missed if youâ€™re doing active work at the time.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set a timer
        2. Wait for it to reach the end of the countdown

        Expected Results:
        Would expect continual haptic feedback tapping on the write until dismissed.

        Actual Results:
        A single tap (sometimes no tap) occurs, which is easily missed if other active work is being done by the wearer.

        Regression:
        Worked properly in watchOS 2.

        Notes:
        N/A.
