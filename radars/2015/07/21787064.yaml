    description: "The IBSC_FLATTEN_NIBS description is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Compiles a Storyboard file into flattened (non-wrapper) Storyboard file. After flattening, the resulting Storyboard is more compact but no longer editable by Interface Builder. When this option is disabled, the resulting Storyboard file remains editable in Interface Builder.\"\r\n\r\nThis description looks like it was copied from the XIB compiler's flatten option.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the text \"flattened (non-wrapper)\" implies a single, regular file. When the equivalent option is used with XIBs, the resulting NIB is a single regular file when this option is YES, and is a bundle (wrapper) containing several additional NIBs, when this option is NO.\r\n\r\nHowever, for storyboards, this isn't the case. When IBSC_FLATTEN_NIBS is set to NO, the storyboard compiler creates an additional designable.storyboard file (which appears to pretty much be a copy of the input storyboard) within the compiled .storyboardc bundle.\r\n\r\nThe point here is that the output of the storyboard compiler is ALWAYS a bundle (wrapper) regardless of the value of IBSC_FLATTEN_NIBS. I suggest the documentation be updated to read something like:\r\n\r\n\"Compiles a Storyboard file into flattened Storyboard. After flattening, the resulting Storyboard is more compact but no longer editable by Interface Builder. When this option is disabled, the resulting Storyboard file remains editable in Interface Builder. Unlike the XIB compiler, the resulting output is always a bundle.\""
