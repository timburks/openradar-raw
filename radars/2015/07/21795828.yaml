    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen calling reloadInputViews immediately after device rotation, the inputView of the target text field is not visibly replaced.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project that demonstrates this issue (except that I can't attach to openRadar). When you push the button, the input view is replaced. When you rotate the device, the view is not replaced.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample project on a device running iOS 9.\r\n2. Tap the text field to give it input focus.\r\n3. Tap the button. Note that the color of the input view switches, indicating that it is being reloaded.\r\n4. Rotate the device. Note that the color of the input view does not switch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nreloadInputViews should work after device rotation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nreloadInputViews does not work after device rotation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 3 (build 13A4293g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug is not present in iOS 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 1, 64 GB, WiFi + Cellular"
