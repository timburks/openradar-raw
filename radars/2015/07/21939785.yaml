    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen text is typed in the textfield, then the app is closed (home key) and reopened, the text either disappears or moves down. In some cases moving the cursor (with arrow keys under the simulator) makes it reappear, in others not.\r\n\r\nTo trigger the issue the UITextField needs to:\r\n* appear in a view whose view controller is pushed onto a UINavigationController;\r\n* have non-default height (larger or smaller appears not to matter, but larger is easier to see);\r\n* have border style anything but round.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project with the \"Single View Application\" template.\r\n2. Replace the storyboard with the file I have attached.\r\n3. Run the application.\r\n4. Type some text in the text field.\r\n5. Close the app (press the home key).\r\n6. Reopen the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text typed in the text field should still be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text field appears to be empty. However, if I continue to type, the original text appears and disappears with each keystroke, misplaced to the bottom of the text field.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll iOS versions from 7.1 to 8.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator (all devices) and iPhone 6.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Main.storyboard' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n(Storyboard contains a single Navigation Controller with root view a View Controller whose view contains a centered UITextField with height 50, border style Bezel.)"
