    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an Xcode workspace's selected scheme is associated with a project that is included as a reference in the workspace (i.e. it's not the main project in a project-based workspace), any change at all to the associated project will cause Xcode to reset the selected scheme to something other than what the user had selected.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly noticeable when working with version control because changes to a project may have occurred outside the scope of Xcode. For example when bisecting to determine the source of a problem, the project file may change with every bisect, causing a frustrating, repeated reset of the active scheme which must then be manually reset.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached SelectedSchemeTest.xcodeproj\r\n2. Ensure the scheme \"OtherProject\" is selected in the Active Scheme indicator.\r\n3. From the Terminal, simulate a change to the project file by e.g.:\r\n\r\ntouch OtherProject/OtherProject.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj\r\n\r\n4. Switch back to Xcode and wait for it to reckon the changed project file.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnless changes to a project have caused the active scheme's target to disappear, the active scheme should remain preserved across reloads of the project.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe active scheme resets to a scheme that is associated with a project that was not modfiied.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0 beta 3 (7A152u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SelectedSchemeTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
