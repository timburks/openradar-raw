        Summary:
        The selection property returns nothing when browsing albums and an album is selected by the user.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select an album
        2. Run this script in Script Editor:
        tell application "Photos"
        	selection
        end tell

        Expected Results:
        Script Editor shows a list of the media items contained in the selected album as result.

        Actual Results:
        Script Editor shows an empty result.

        Regression:
        The issue always occurs.

        Notes:
        Since the "start slideshow" command now requires a list of media items, it is currently not possible to mimic the result of the user pressing the "play" button in the Photos toolbar - which, if an entire album is selected - will play that entire album.
