        Summary:
        Sometimes I’m just queueing stuff up to listen to throughout the day, and I don’t want to have to remember where I was scrolled to after I return from viewing a playlist or an album.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Find some cool, recommended albums or playlists in the “For You” Section.
        2. Select the album title or playlist title to view the album or playlist.
        3. Add it to your up next queue.
        4. Tap the back button to return to your position before you added the album.

        Expected Results:
        I would be returned to the scroll position where I left.

        Actual Results:
        I’m always returned to the top of the list.

        Notes:
        Another solution to this issue would be providing a mechanism for queuing albums or playlists from the “For You” list directly.
