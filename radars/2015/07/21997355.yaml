    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently in iOS 9 beta 4, there's no easy way to turn on Low Power Mode. You have to go to Settings > Battery and tap the switch. It's a hassle. A faster and convenient way to do it would be to allow the tapping of the battery indicator in the top right corner of the screen to toggle Low Power Mode.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 9, we can already tap the back left corner of the screen to go back to a previous app, so it's a pattern that already exists on the platform\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap battery indicator in top right corner of the screen\r\n2. Low Power Mode is turned on\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9"
