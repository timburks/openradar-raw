        Summary:
        When setting up an event in Calendar, I can select a travel time. Calendar knows I am at work, but I will be leaving for this event from home. Calendar does not give me Home as an option. If I set up as Work, then the next day, iOS tells me to leave based on the incorrect travel time

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Set up event at one location
        Set up travel time
        Leave for even from vastly different location

        Expected Results:
        I expect to not have to set travel time at all. I expect to just see the travel time based on where I currently am to where I need to go.

        Actual Results:
        Travel time is hard coded to the time set at the creation of the event.

        Notes:
        Ironically, Waze pulled the event from my Calendar and told me the night before what time I should expect to leave based on past traffic history.

        Be more like Waze.
