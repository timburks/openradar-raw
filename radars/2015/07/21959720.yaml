    description: "Summary:\r\n[NSLocale preferredLanguages] now return new language format: ru-RU, en-RU and old two-characters format: ru, en. Before in iOS 8 and earler its return correct two-characters format: ru, en. With this bug i can now add multiple copy of one language in settings menu. Two English for example and this will be: array(en-RU, en). I add screenshot with this situation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) open Settings > General > Language & Region\r\n2) click Other Languages button\r\n3) add some language, Russian for example (now u add two characters ru locale)\r\n4) select Keep English (or what set in your default language)\r\n5) click iPhone Language button\r\n6) select Russian again\r\n7) select Change to Russian\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nchange language to Russian and menu now show: Russian, English\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwe add Russian language again, but with another code format ru-RU and in menu it show two Russian languages: Russian, Russian, English.. we can add two English now and it show: Russian, Russian, English, English\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsers can be shocked this situation with language list. Developers must now check 2 locales format in the method preferredLanguages, and not one as it was before, its crazy.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 plus, 128GB, WiFi; iPad Air, 32GB, WiFi\r\n\r\nSo bafore when we click iPhone Language button it change language and show in method preferredLanguages two characters format (ru) without adding duplicate language. But now its add duplicate language with new locale format (ru-RU), i think its actual usability and programming bug. Please contact with me if need addition explanation."
