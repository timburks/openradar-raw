    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen browsing a home sharing library, there is this additional bar where I can decide whether to see all items or just the ones not in my library. Since iTunes 12.2, this layout wrapper seems to mess up the inner view in some cases. The following views work fine: songs view, artists, genres, composers. However, albums view appears empty (at least on playlists – see screenshot) and playlist view appears but is not scrollable beyond the first page of songs (only the outer view scrolls but not the song list itself).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a home sharing library.\r\n2. Select a playlist.\r\n3. Go into playlist or albums view.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe albums and songs should show up and be scrollable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlbums view is empty and the song list in playlist view are not scrollable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.2.1.16 (OS X)"
