    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you click on an icon in the Issue Navigator that repressents a target, the focused editor view DOES change to the pertinent Project/Targets attribute editor for that target, however the SPECIFIC target that was clicked is not made the focus of the attributes editor, so you have to make an additional visual scan for the target and then click it to begin working with it.\r\n\r\nBecause the whole reason for clicking on the target icon in the Issue Navigator is to deal with the issue it is reporting, it makes sense that it should infer selecting and focusing on the pertinent target.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot for an illustration\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0 beta 3 (7A152u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'RSCrashReporter_xcodeproj.png' was successfully uploaded."
