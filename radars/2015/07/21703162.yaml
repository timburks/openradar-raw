    description: "Summary:\r\nWebKit, as an open source project seeks to capitalize on the cumulative effort of developers around the world, including non-Apple-employees.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, any such developers who also have reason to stay at the bleeding edge of OS X beta software releases become cut off from WebKit development and testing whenever an OS X beta release program is in effect.\r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure of the causes, but I know that a pivotal component is the platform/OS-specific \"system interface\" library checked in to e.g. WebKitLibraries/libWebKitSystemInterfaceYosemite.a. As far as I know, this library is currently required to build and run WebKit, and a version suitable for a particular major release (e.g. El Capitan 10.11) is only ever updated after the release has gone final.\r\n\r\nI am assuming this is the central cause of the problem that prevents WebKit nightly builds from being downloaded and run on OS X beta release systems.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether the reasons for the existence of these system interface libraries has historically been technical, political, or a mix of each.\r\n\r\nI would like to be a more active participant in the WebKit open source project but I am precluded from doing so without jumping through additional hoops (maintaining a second system with older OS X installed, or using a virtual machine).\r\n\r\nI think it would benefit the WebKit project and, by assocation, Apple, if this limitation were somehow lifted so that developers who install OS X betas are empowered to build and run, and to download nightly builds, of the WebKit project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 (15A204h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
