    description: "Summary:\r\niOS system partition is getting bigger, hence the user-data partition shrinks with each major iOS update release, which makes the already-small-16GB devices only having about 10-11GB of available space. \r\n\r\nAnd 8GB devices suffers even more, with only 5.6GB of free space on clean installation.\r\n\r\nPlease consider moving certain non-critical part of iOS out of system partition and leave them either on-demand or in mobile user's Assets folder (like enhanced Siri voices, fonts or dictionary data).\r\n\r\nSome assets that are completely unnecessary for iPad are somehow left in the system partition. For example, despite iPad does not have Weather app, while Clock and Siri only calls for certain static image assets, Weather app animation assets (about 200MB) are still left in iPad's file system. \r\n\r\nAlso, iPad's wallpaper alone takes about half gigabyte of storage space, can we have them on-demand? These spaces could have been used as something more useful, such as user's documents, songs or photos.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\niPad iOS 8.4 filesystem:\r\n\r\n/Library/Wallpapers\r\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Weather.framework\r\n\r\nand son on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe size of iOS system partition is minimized while maintaining performance and stability.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe size of iOS system partition contains assets, codes that might be irrelevant to the user, or the device user uses.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
