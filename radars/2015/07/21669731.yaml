    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen pressing the “…” button next to an album or playlist title, not all actions are immediately available. I’ve learned that clicking a combination of the back button, then the forward button will “unlock” these actions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an album or a playlist that you’ve never opened before.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach time I click on the button, I’d expect to see the same items available in the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEach time I click on the button, I see the same items available in the list, unless I press back and forward between the times I click on the button. Typically, the “Play Next” and “Add to Up Next” items are missing from the list.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
