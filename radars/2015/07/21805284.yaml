        The Apple Watch’s touchscreen doesn’t work reliably anywhere near water. It can be the ocean, a swimming pool, or your own sweat. This is a problem in the Workout app, which is heavily dependent on touch:

        • The only way to launch the Workout app is from the watch home screen. Siri won’t work because your iPhone doesn’t like to go near water!
        • Workouts are started by tapping, swiping and tapping again.
        • Workouts are stopped by force press, tapping, swiping or scrolling, and then tapping again.

        All of these things are extremely hard to do when the screen is exposed to water, including the wearer’s own perspiration.
