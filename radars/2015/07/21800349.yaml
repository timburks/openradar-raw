    description: "Summary:\r\nFairly frequently, my iPhone will do a hard reset, preceded by an all-blue screen. It happens at random times of day, with random foreground apps open. The one link I can think of is that it only seems to happen while I’m connected to my OS X Server VPN, from a remote wi-fi network. It has happened as long as I’ve had my iPhone 6 (fall of last year), persisted across swapping out the phone at the Genius Bar, and still happens with iOS 8.4"
