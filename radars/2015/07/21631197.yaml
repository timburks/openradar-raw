    description: "It should be simple to create a String from UTF-8 data regardless of the specific type. Currently a [UInt8] (unsigned) cannot be simply converted to String because String(UTF8String:) requires an UnsafePointer<Int8> (signed).\r\n\r\nString(UTF8String:) should be modified to accept void* (since UnsafePointer<Void> accept anything). Alternately (or in addition), UnsafePointer<UInt8> and UnsafePointer<Int8> should be implicitly exchangeable to help bridge to their wildly inconsistent use in C (particularly regarding char* vs unsigned char*).\r\n\r\nIn addition to String(UTF8String: UnsafePointer<UInt8>) working correctly, String(UTF8String: [UInt8]) should work as well. The array should not require a trailing \\0 (like in initWithData:encoding). (A similar name, such as String(UTF8Bytes:) would make sense as well.)"
