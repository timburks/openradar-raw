    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22050103\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe show a table where items are created some time in the past. “3 weeks ago” or “1 day ago”.\r\n\r\nBefore we used TTTTimeIntervalFormatter (https://github.com/mattt/FormatterKit/blob/master/FormatterKit/TTTTimeIntervalFormatter.h) which has this feature. NSDateComponentsFormatter seems like a great replacement, unfortunately it doesn’t has present/pastDeicticExpressions. So we get “3 weeks” or “about 3 weeks” but not “3 weeks ago” in a language consistent way (german would be vor 3 Tagen, so reverse).\r\n\r\nThis seems like an obvious omission and should be added in a future release."
