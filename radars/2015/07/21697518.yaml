    description: "Summary:\r\nBeats1 has a wide variety of shows and presenters, with more shows being announced and added all the time. While a schedule is available to view in Music.app on iOS, or at beats1radio.com, it would be very useful to subscribe or favourite a show and receive a push notification shortly before the show begins.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music.app\r\n2. Navigate to the Radio tab\r\n3. Click the Beats1 banner / station\r\n4. Select a featured show, upcoming show, or a show from the “Complete Schedule” link, eg. St Vincent’s Mixtape Delivery Service\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe given an option to favourite or subscribe to a show and receive push notifications when a show is about to begin.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis option is not presented.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis could perhaps be linked to the “Follow” feature. If I follow St Vincent’s Mixtape Delivery Service, it makes sense that I would want to be notified when a new show is about to broadcast."
