    description: "Summary:\r\nI noticed that I've been able to fill the activity (movement) ring too easily. \r\n\r\nToday I spent the day at the desk typing on my computer and in the afternoon my apple watch had filled almost all the movement ring (440 kcal). I noticed that it detects my wrist moving while I'm typing and it thinks I'm standing and moving.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPerform typing on a keyboard for a prolonged period of time\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple Watch shouldn't detect keyboard typing movements as any significant level of activity; it should also detect that I'm not actually standing while I type for prolonged time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple Watch thinks I'm moving while typing on keyboard (even though only my hands/wrists are moving), and classifies it as a movement (even though in reality all I do is sitting in one place)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0 (13S5305d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFiled it as a serious bug because it basically negates the usefulness of activity tracking functionality just for the people who should be reminded to move more.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch sports"
