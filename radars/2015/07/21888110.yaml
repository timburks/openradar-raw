    description: "Summary:\n\nYou cannot set the tag of a custom NSView in Interface Builder. This is a pain :) (Especially now that more people will be using them thanks to @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable support)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Create a custom NSView \n2. Try to set its tag via the Attributes Inspector\n\nExpected Results:\n\nIt just works, like with any other NSView.\n\nActual Results:\n\nIt doesn’t work — the option is greyed out.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nI actually had to do this :)\n\nextension NSView\n{\n    func viewWithCustomTag(customTag:Int) -> NSView?\n    {\n        //\n        // Iterates over subviews and returns the view with the specified custom tag.\n        // The custom view must implement the CustomTaggable protocol.\n        //\n        // (Why we can’t use regular tags in custom NSViews is beyond me.)\n        //\n        for view in subviews\n        {\n            if let view = view as?
