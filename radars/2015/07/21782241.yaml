        Summary:
        If a third-party app has indexed information into CoreSpotlight, Siri should be able to search it. For instance, my app indexes beers into CoreSpotlight. Typing the text brings the results up perfectly in Spotlight, but asking Siri for results from my app doesn't work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Type Flying Dog into Spotlight and look at results. Results are relevant and come from my beer app.
        2. Ask Siri "Search MyBeerApp for Flying Dog"

        Expected Results:
        Same results list from "Steps to Reproduce 1"

        Actual Results:
        "OK, I found this on the web for 'MyBeerApp for Flying Dog'"
