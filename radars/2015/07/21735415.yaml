    description: "Summary:\r\nI have various stretchable, 9-part images in my app that are no longer displaying correctly when I build for OS X 10.11 (or iOS 9). The same image assets displayed correctly in OS X 10.10 (and iOS 8). Depending on the image, it may show lines where the image was sliced, or it may even show some slices darker than others. I have attached a sample app demonstrating this as well as various screenshots:\r\n\r\nexample 1 - 10.10: This is the sample app on 10.10, which looks more or less correct.\r\nexample 1 - 10.10 zoomed: If you zoom in closely you can actually see some faint lines where the image is sliced—these really shouldn't be there, though at least they're difficult to see without zooming.\r\nexample 1 - 10.11: This is the same build on 10.11. As you can see there are pronounced lines where the image was sliced, visible even at normal sizes.\r\nexample 2 - 10.10: This is an example from my own app Deliveries on 10.10. The image background is an even color as it should be.\r\nexample 2 - 10.11: This is Deliveries built for 10.11 with the same image assets. This is… not even remotely correct.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample app on 10.11.\r\n2. Examine the image in the middle of the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should be a rounded rectangle with an almost white, even colored background. The rectangle should have a hairline (1pt), medium grey stroke around it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe background is not an even color—there are various lines inside of it. There's a prominent, unwanted box outline inside of it, as well as some very faint unwanted lines inside the corners.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11 beta 3 (15A216g) and Xcode 7 beta 3 (7A152u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug was also present in 10.11 beta 2, and I believe it was in the first beta too—though I'm not 100% positive. As noted in the description, it's also present in the iOS 9 betas.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\n2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
