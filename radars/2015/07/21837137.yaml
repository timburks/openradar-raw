    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you’re on an album’s page in “New” and you click the “…” button, you can click “Add To” to add the item directly to a playlist, but not when searching.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search for a song in Apple Music\r\n2. Scroll to find the version you’re looking for\r\n3. Click the “…” button next to the song’s name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContext menu includes the “Add To” item, allowing direct add to playlist\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou need to click on the album’s title, then click on the “…” button next to the song’s name from the album’s page\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would make it easier and quicker to add songs from Apple Music to your library if you, like me, don’t add any items directly to the root library, always starting from a playlist"
