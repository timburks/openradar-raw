    description: "Summary:\r\nSo I went to cache my music library to my iPhone, it seemed that it wouldn't have it. It got to about 2 GB before stopping download. So, in order to not have random songs either cached or uncached, I thought I would start off with a relatively clean slate. Turns out, the Music app doesn't even recognize which songs are cached or not. So I decided to edit the storage of the app manually in Settings (it should still do that when not crashing, if precedent is to be trusted with previous releases). In the view for the different apps, the table view cell for the music app is notably missing the label for the Music app name. Something must be wrong, I thought to myself. I tapped the table view row and sure enough the app crashed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music app\r\n2. For a bunch of songs/albums/artists, select \"Make Available Online\"\r\n2b. (Bonus) Try to then remove those songs from the offline cache.\r\n3. Open Settings app\r\n4. Go to General > Storage and iCloud Usage > Manage Storage (from Storage section)\r\n5. Notice the app-name-label-less table view row for the Music app.\r\n6. Tap that row, and observe the crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new view controller to appear allowing me to manage my on-device music storage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Settings app just crashed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 Beta 3 [13A4293g]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease help! I have been using the free trial of Apple Music since this third beta came out last Wednesday, and I've been really enjoying it for the most part. If these bug and kinks can be fixed, I would be able to have a greater appreciation for this service.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus; 64 GB; Verizon; Using Wi-Fi"
