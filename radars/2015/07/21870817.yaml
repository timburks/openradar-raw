        Summary:
        In iOS SDK 9, there are still many delegate properties that are declared with "assign" which can lead to crashes. Since introduction of ARC these should be declared as "weak".

        In iOS 9 SDK finally many delegates in UIKit have been changed and declared as "weak" (e.g. the UIScrollView delegate). Still there are several delegate properties declared as "assign", like the following:


        * CLLocationManager
        * NSFetchedResultsController
        * NSCache
        * UIWebView
        * UIToolbar
        * UITabBar


        Expected Results:
        All delegates in iOS SDK should be declared "weak".
