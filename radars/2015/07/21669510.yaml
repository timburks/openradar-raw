    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS 9 come generics for Objective-C. These generics make casts like \"view.subviews as! [UIView]\" unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading a project using \"Convert > To Latest Swift Syntax\" then the convert replaces for example \"view.subviews as! [UIView]\" with \"view.subviews as [UIView]\" which results in an unnecessary cast.\r\nInstead the converter should remove the cast completely as \"view.subviews\" is already of type [UIView].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy the code from the attached file into a Playground\r\n2. Use \"Convert > To Latest Swift Syntax\"\r\n3. Notice how there now is an unnecessary cast from [UIView] to [UIView]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe converter should remove the cast which is now longer necessary.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is an unnecessary cast from [UIView] to [UIView]\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached file:\r\n\r\nimport UIKit\r\n\r\nfunc test(view: UIView) {\r\n\tfor _ in view.subviews as! [UIView] {\r\n\t\t// ...\r\n\t}\r\n}"
