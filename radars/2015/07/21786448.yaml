    description: "Summary:\r\nOccasionally when I'm switching between listening to Beats 1 and an Overcast podcast, Beats 1 starts when I click my headset play/pause button to pause the podcast. Also, occasionally, Beats 1 will start when my audio source changes from my bluetooth headset to my car.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair a bluetooth headset with playback controls (may also work with earbud controls)\r\n2. Start playing Beats 1\r\n3. Open Overcast and start playing a podcast (Beats 1 automatically stops)\r\n4. Click the headset play/pause button to pause a podcast\r\n- or -\r\n4. Get into a car with a previously paired head unit and turn it on and let the phone connect. (may also work with any other additional bluetooth devices)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOvercast pauses playback (or continues to play on my car)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOvercast pauses playback and Beats 1 starts (or overcast switches to the car and promptly stops and Beats 1 starts)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nForwarding Radar ID and bug report to Marco Arment, the developer of overcast.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 64GB Verizon on LTE"
