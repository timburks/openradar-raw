    description: "Summary:\r\nCore Spotlight indices behave as a write-only variable. For example, it is impossible to inspect their contents to find out what CSSearchableItems are currently indexed in the searchable index.\r\n\r\nIn case the application works with data that may be changed outside of it (e.g. account state is being synced across devices via a third party service) this may be necessary to find out whether the index contains stale data.\r\n\r\nLack of this API forces developers to reimplement (possibly imperfectly) the index as a local database and make sure the Core Spotlight and their own index remain in sync.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInvestigate the headers of CSSearchableIndex.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCSSearchableIndex instance should have a public method such as:\r\n\r\n- (void)enumerateSearchableItemsUsingBlock:(void (^ nonnull)(NSArray<CSSearchableItem *> nonnull *searchableItems))block;\r\n\r\nSuch method would call the block with an array containing the CSSearchableItems currently present in the searchable index.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such method exists.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 and iOS Simulator"
