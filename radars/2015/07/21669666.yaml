    description: "Summary:\r\nThe “Up Next” queue should operate at the level of abstraction that the user specifies when inserting items into the queue. If a user adds an album to the up next queue, the album should be displayed as one item there. The same goes for playlists: if a user adds a playlist to the up next queue, the playlist should be displayed as one item there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd an album to the “Up Next” queue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that album to be treated as one complete unit. I do not expect that adding an album is simply a shortcut for adding all of its songs to the “Up Next” queue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAdding an album to the “Up Next” queue is treated as a shortcut for adding all of its songs to the queue."
