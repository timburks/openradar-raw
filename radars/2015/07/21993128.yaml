    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that WebKit/Safari places position:fixed elements incorrectly when they do not have a left/right/top/bottom property set on them and are a child of an element that is position:relative;left:X%;\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshots. Safari renders the example differently from Chrome. IE11 and Firefox give the same result as Chrome.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsbin.com/rohemer in OS X Safari or iOS Safari.\r\n2. Look at the red paragraph's text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe red paragraph's text makes sense because all of its text is visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe red paragraph's text doesn't quite make sense, because part of it isn't visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThe problem occurs on both OS X and iOS, and with WebKit Nightly.\r\nOS X Safari version: 8.0.7 (10600.7.12)\r\nWebKit Nightly version: r186963\r\nOS X version: Yosemite\r\niOS version: 8.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147284\r\nPossibly related to: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122878\r\nOriginal Bootstrap issue: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/16814\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'safari-wrong.png', 'chrome-correct.png' and 'testcase.html' were successfully uploaded."
