    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen restoring, erasing or doing any other type of operation with Disk Utility, there is no estimation of completion.\r\n\r\nThese operations can take a long time, so an estimate is very helpful (you can set an alarm on your Apple Watch to check on progress!)\r\n\r\nAlso, a numeric value is much easier to track than watching the progress bar. The indicator moves very slowly for a large disk and it can easily take a minute or two to see a single pixel change notifying you that things are progressing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIn 10.10 and earlier releases of OS X, Disk Utility provided this information."
