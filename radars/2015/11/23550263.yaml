    description: "Summary:\nWhen trying to profile on my device, Instruments shows the message “This device is not currently online”.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Plug in a device running iOS 9.1.\n- Click on Product -> Profile.\n- Select “Time Profiler”\n\nExpected Results:\n- The device is connected, so upon clicking on the “record” button I should be able to profile my app on the device.\n\nActual Results:\n- Instruments shows the message “This device is not currently online”, so I can’t do anything.\n\nRegression:\n- This had been working until Xcode 7.1. Profiling on the simulator works too, but I need to do it on a device!\n\nNotes:\n- I’ve followed all the workarounds in https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/16242 (restarting Xcode and the device, etc.), but nothing has worked. \n\nIf I manually launch Instruments and select my device from the list of devices I’m presented with the prompt “Enable this device for development? This will open Xcode and enable this device for development”. Tapping on yes launches Xcode but nothing happens, and Console.app shows the following message, without further details:\n11/15/15 10:11:40.292 Xcode[60346]: AMDeviceSetValue (thread 0x700000081000): Could not set [com.apple.xcode.developerdomain, DeveloperStatus] to value 'Development': 0xe8000017.\n\nNote that my device IS enabled for development: I can _run_ (not profile) the app on it just fine. Also, the device looks functional in Xcode -> Window -> Devices. There are no “warning” signs or anything like that."
