        Summary:
        launchctl fails to parse property list files in the JSON or ASCII format

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create service property list in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.service.plist
        2. Convert service property list to JSON: `plutil -convert json ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.service.plist`
        3. Load service property list with launchctl: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.service.plist`

        Expected Results:
        launchctl loads the property list and registers the defined service with launchd

        Actual Results:
        launchctl aborts with the error message: “Invalid property list”

        Regression:
        The problem always occurs.

        Notes:
        Both xml1 and binary1 formats work fine, json and old-style ascii don’t, even though `plutil -lint` parses the files just fine and can even convert them back to xml1 or binary1, after which launchctl accepts the files again.
