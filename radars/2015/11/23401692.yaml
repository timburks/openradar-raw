        Summary:

        When hitting a GameCenter button in any tvOS app without being signed, it will bring up a “Sign In” / “Cancel” alert. Pressing buttons in that dialog is only possible with the Siri Remote, not with a Game Controller. All screens before and after work just fine with the Game Controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Sign out of GameCenter
        2. Try to sign in from an app using a Game Controller

        Expected Results:

        The sign in button can be pressed.

        Actual Results:

        The sign in button cannot be pressed, user has to switch to a Siri Remote.
