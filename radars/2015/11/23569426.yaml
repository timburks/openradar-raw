    description: "Summary:\r\nYou can no longer export the contents of the simulator pasteboard to the host's pasteboard using Edit->Copy.  When you attempt to paste the contents in OS X, it pastes the original contents previously of the host pasteboard.  I.e. the export from the simulator does nothing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go into any app (e.g. Maps) on the iOS simulator in Xcode 7.1.\r\n2. Add some text to a text field.\r\n3. Select that text, and choose Copy to copy it to the simulator's pasteboard.\r\n4. Optionally, verify that re-pasting the text in the simulator works as it should.\r\n5. Select Edit->Copy from the Simulator app menu.\r\n6. In any OS X app with a paste-able control field (e.g. TextEdit), try to paste the contents of the pasteboard (Command-V or right-click paste).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text you selected and copied from the simulator should be pasted into your OS X app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe original contents of your OS X pasteboard are pasted instead.  I.e. the export option from the simulator app does nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.1.1 (7B1005), OS X Version 10.10.5 (14F1021).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator version 9.0, 9.1.  Tried different iPhone and iPad simulators, as well as hard resetting the simulators and trying from a clean install."
