        Summary:
        SKStoreProductsViewController doesn’t show an “Update” button for an app which has an update available. It should.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * submit an app to the App Store which presents a SKStoreProductViewController with it’s own app page displayed
        * submit a new version for that app
        * view the SKStoreProductViewController within the app when the update is available in the store

        Expected Results:
        * “Update” button on the product page in SKStoreProductViewController visible and functional

        Actual Results:
        * Only an “Open” button is displayed

        Regression:
