    description: "Summary:\r\nI have several ideas where an Apple TV could be used as a kind of smart, contextual display, depending on the people, users, devices that are near. To make that work, iBeacons would be a great, easy to implement, easy to use match.\r\nIt could also work in an opposite direction where the Apple TV could emit a beacon signal and iPhones, iPads get to do stuff with it, but I'm not really seeing a really valuable case for that, for now.\r\n\r\nI've kind of hacked my way around this obstacle as a proof of concept, but there's no way this thing can get to a production level if every user has to start hacking their Apple TV. \r\n\r\nPlease consider enabling this functionality in (one of) the next release(s) of the SDK.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMartijn\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeacon Region Monitoring and CLBeacon class should not be prohibited in tvOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNew Apple TV Developer Kit\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
