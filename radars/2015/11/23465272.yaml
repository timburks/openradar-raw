    description: "Summary:\r\nNote: I'm really reopening 22960120. I thought the provided solution might work, but I don't think it does.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have a protocol and multiple implementations of that protocol. I'd be great to have a way to specify a protocol for the testing itself, along with a protocol extension with the common tests.\r\n\r\nThis means I could have:\r\n\r\nprotocol CommonTests {\r\n    var testObject: SomeProtocol!\r\n\r\n    func testA()\r\n    func testB()\r\n}\r\n\r\nextension CommonTests {\r\n    func testA() { ... }\r\n    func testB() { ... }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass SomeClassATests: XCTestCase, CommonTests {\r\n    var testObject: SomeProtocol!\r\n    override func setUp() {\r\n        super.setUp()\r\n        testObject = SomeClassA()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass SomeClassBTests: XCTestCase, CommonTests {\r\n    var testObject: SomeProtocol!\r\n    override func setUp() {\r\n        super.setUp()\r\n        testObject = SomeClassB()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe original solution was to create a common subclass that could test both, but this confuses the relationship. A common subclass cannot exist because these are protocols, so the common subclass would need to have some sort of implementation of testObject for that to work. SomeClassATests could be the base class, but this seems to just confusion the relationship.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTests are run for test case and the results would show up in the test navigator.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDoing this currently shows no tests in the test navigator and none of the code in the test protocol extensions is run.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1(7B91b) / Mac OS X 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
