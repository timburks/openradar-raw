    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI often observe audio just getting disabled and not coming out of my Mac (via the jack). I hit volume down/up buttons and it shows the crossed circle/unavailable icon. I have to unplug and re-plug the jack, sometimes twice of thrice, for the audio to come back on.\r\n\r\nThis seems to usually happen when I wake my Mac from sleep, open my MacBook’s cover, or close it and go back to the clamshell mode (with an external monitor being the only display)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- wake Mac from sleep; or\r\n- change display configuration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- audio via jack works\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- audio stops working, and i have to re-establish the connection.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI’ve never had this issue on Yosemite on the exact same setup (well… actually, I saw something like it maybe a few times), but I immediately saw it on a fresh install of 10.11.1 on the same machine\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy setup is Late 2013 Retina MBP 15’’ (no discrete GPU), almost always used in clamshell mode, a standard audio jack, and a display (Dell P2415Q) connected to the computer via mini DisplayPort. The display has its own audio interface (a jack) on its back, but I don’t use it, nor was it ever a problem before upgrading to El Cap."
