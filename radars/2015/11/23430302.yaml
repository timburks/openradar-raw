    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, no matter what restrictions you set, posters for movies/tv shows of any rating - like \"Magic Mike\" - will appear, even thought your kids can't actually watch it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Settings App on AppleTV\r\n2. Go to General -> Restrictions\r\n4. Set it to only allow G rated moves (or some other level)\r\n5. Go back to the main screen so you can see movies\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movie posters at the top of the screen should be filtered based on my restriction settings.  I should NOT see a poster for rated R (restricted) movies.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see all content, regardless of restriction settings and have no way to remove them w/o turning off movies entirely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.0 (13T5379f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not something that my children should be privy to.  It is the kind of thing that will make people not use/return the AppleTv, and definitely make it so I can't recommend it as a good device for families with children at home still.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV Model A1625"
