    description: "Summary:\n- The documentation for `precondition` and `preconditionFailure` still refers to -Ounchecked, but this optimization level no longer exists in Swift 2.x.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Open the documentation for these functions: https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/Swift/Reference/Swift_StandardLibrary_Functions/index.html#//apple_ref/swift/func/s:FSs12preconditionFTKT_SbKT_SS4fileVSs12StaticString4lineSu_T_.\n\nExpected Results:\n- The documentation for `precondition` correctly explains the behavior for the different optimization levels.\n\nActual Results:\n- It currently reads: \nIn -Ounchecked builds, condition is not evaluated, but the optimizer may assume that it would evaluate to true. Failure to satisfy that assumption in -Ounchecked builds is a serious programming error.\n\nRegression:\n- This has been incorrect since the initial Swift 2.0 release."
