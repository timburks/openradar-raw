        Summary:

        In previous versions of OS X’s Disk Utility application, there was a “Turn Off Encryption” option available in Disk Utility’s File menu. It appears to have been removed in El Capitan’s Disk Utility. Could it please be put back?

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open Disk Utility
        2. Select File menu
        3. Look for “Turn Off Encryption” option

        Expected Results:

        “Turn Off Encryption” option available under the File menu (see attached diskutility_turn_off_encryption.png)

        Actual Results:

        “Turn Off Encryption” option was not available under the File menu.

        Regression:

        “Turn Off Encryption” option was available under the File menu from 10.7.0 - 10.10.5.
