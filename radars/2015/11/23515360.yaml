    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen testing upgrades from the current App Store version of an app to a prerelease version on TestFlight a warning is shown when installing the TestFlight build, indicating that data may be lost. This makes it challenging to ensure that no migration issues occur when the TestFlight build is submitted and subsequently released.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an App Store version of an app.\r\n2. Create a TestFlight build of this app and make available for internal testing.\r\n3. Choose to update the App Store version to the build for internal testing in TestFlight.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe App Store version of the app is updated to the TestFlight build without any data loss.\r\nThis appears to have been the behaviour prior to at least 1.3.0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA warning is shown that data may be lost (see attachment http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLvWy.png) and all data relating to the app, including its file system container and keychain items are cleared after choosing to install.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S A1688 MKQN2ZD/A, iOS 9.1 (13B143), TestFlight 1.3.1"
