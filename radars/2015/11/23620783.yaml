    description: "Summary:\r\nSince installing the latest seed, when I unlock my screen, my external monitor (a Dell P2415Q) is not detected by the Mac, and the Mac is not seen by the monitor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a Dell P2415Q monitor using the mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable that came with the monitor.\r\n2. Use. Enjoy.\r\n3. Lock screen (with Control-Shift-Eject) and go away for a couple of minutes (e.g., to get a glass of water).\r\n4. Return.  Tap Shift to get a login screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth monitors should light up and show the desktops assigned to them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niMac screen lights up, allows log in.  External monitor comes on (wakes), stays black, then displays a message about going to sleep, screen goes black again, power light flashes slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.2 (15C47a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I put the machine to sleep (Apple->Sleep) and wait a little bit before waking it back up, the external monitor is seen by the Mac and vice versa.\r\n\r\nAs I lock and unlock my screen many times a day, this behavior is really annoying.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac15,1\r\nOS X 10.11.2 (15C47a)\r\nSerial Number C02P300WFY6F\r\n\r\nexternal Dell P2415Q monitor, 2304 x 1296 @ 60 Hz, connected over DisplayPort (Thunderbolt port on Mac to full-size DisplayPort on the monitor)."
