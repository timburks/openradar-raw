    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSwift initializers are not differentiated based on their optionality or\r\nability to throw.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a swift struct/protocol/class\r\n2. Create 3 initializers with the same argument, but one optional, and\r\n   one that throws\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached playground\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nEverything compiles correctly, and the type is inferred based on the\r\ncaller.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nA compiler error is produced:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalid redeclaration of 'init(string:)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- This is very similar to <rdar://23226135> but for initializers"
