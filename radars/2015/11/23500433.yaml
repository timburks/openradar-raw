    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nScheme settings provide an option to override application data (Product->Scheme->Edit Scheme->Options->Application Data). It works as expected on real device, but doesn't do anything on simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Make an .xcappdata bundle with application data\r\n2. Add it to an Xcode project\r\n3. Select the data bundle in scheme options (Product->Scheme->Edit Scheme->Options->Application Data)\r\n4. Launch the app on Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nApp is launched with supplied application data\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nApplication data is not changed\r\n\r\nXcode version:\r\n\r\nXcode 7.2 beta 2 (7C46t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAdded an example project that fetches a string from user defaults. Two versions of application data is added to the project."
