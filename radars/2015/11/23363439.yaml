    description: "Summary:\r\nIt’s wonderful that apple-app-site-association allows for wildcard and whitelisting, but we’d like to be able to blacklist parts of our site from universal links.\r\n\r\nHere’s the use case for Khan Academy: we have videos, exercises, articles, and programming challenges on our site. We have a URL system for identifying which content item is at a particular link:\r\n\r\n*/v/* is a video\r\n*/e/* is an exercise\r\n*/a/* is an article\r\n*/p/* is a programming challenge\r\n\r\nWe have support on both our iPad and iPhone apps for videos and articles, but we don’t support exercises on iPhone, and we don’t support programming challenges on either device.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, we’d like to be able to blacklist URLs that contain */p/* or */e/*\r\n\r\nIdeally, this is what our apple-app-site-association file would be:\r\n{\r\n  \"applinks\": {\r\n    \"apps\": [],\r\n    \"details\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"appID\": \"ABCD1234.org.khanacademy.Khan-Academy\",\r\n        \"paths\": [ \r\n          \"*/v/*\",\r\n          \"*/a/*\",\r\n          \"/math/*\",\r\n          \"/science/*\",\r\n          \"/economics-finance-domain/*\",\r\n          \"/humanities/*\",\r\n          \"/computing/*\",\r\n          \"/test-prep/*\",\r\n          \"/partner-content/*\",\r\n          \"/talks-and-interviews/*\",\r\n          \"/coach-res/*\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"blacklisted-paths\": [\r\n        \"*/e/*\",\r\n        \"*/p/*\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nInstead, what we have today is an apple-app-site-association file that allows exercise links, and shows an error message in our iPhone app when it’s opened to an exercise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n...not really applicable here, but: \r\nHave a website that contains lots of content, most of which is supported in the app but not all.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect that I would be able to blacklist a particular URL pattern\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe're unable to blacklist a URL pattern, so we wound up having to allow potentially non-supported links to open our app, and present a UIAlertView for that unsupported content.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
