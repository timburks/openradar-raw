    description: "[Want to discuss? Get in touch with me @jamesreggio.]\r\n\r\nAs the title says, SFSafariViewController will not trigger dismissal when a VoiceOver user performs the global dismiss gesture, which is described as using two fingers to draw a 'Z' shape. (This gesture triggers an accessibilityPerformEscape: message from the UIAccessibilityAction informal protocol.)\r\n\r\nIt is also not possible to intercept and process this gesture within the host application due to the remoting security involved in running SFSafariViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable VoiceOver.\r\n2. Open a website in SFSafariViewController.\r\n3. Draw a 'Z' shape with two fingers on the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSFSafariViewController dismisses and send the safariViewControllerDidFinish: message to its delegate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 on iOS 9.1 (13B143)"
