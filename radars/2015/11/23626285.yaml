    description: "Summary:\nIt would be a very very great help if we could log in with multiple Apple IDs into Testflight. Especially for client agencies, you often are invited for a developer team with an email address of the clientâ€™s choice, which makes internal testing multiple apps for different clients a hassle in TestFlight, since you have to log in or out. \nAnd even as a single developer, you often want your developer account separate from your personal buying account. Also in this scenario you would like to log in with both your personal account for regular beta testing and as a developer to test your own app.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nN/A\n\nExpected Results:\nIn addition to being automatically logged in with the same Apple ID, Testflight could add the possibility to log in with additional developer accounts. All available beta test apps could be visible in the same screen, maybe with an indication which account made them available.\n\nActual Results:\nN/A\n\nRegression:\nN/A\n\nNotes:\nN/A"
