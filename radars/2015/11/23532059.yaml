        I renewed my S/MIME cert and was wondering why I couldn't decrypt some emails sent to me. On the Mac I could successfully decrypt them.

        It turned out that the sender used my old cert to encrypt the emails to me. I verified this by asking the sender to install my new cert. From then on I could successfully decrypt emails.

        I've installed both the old and the renewed cert as profiles on iOS. The renewed cert is selected in the S/MIME settings for both signing and encrypting.

        So it turns out that installed but not selected (in S/MIME settings) identities are not used to decrypt emails. This is bad because a) some users might still encrypt emails to me using my old cert and b) I want to be able to decrypt past emails sent to me, even when fetched later from the IMAP server.
