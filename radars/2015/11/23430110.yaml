    description: "Summary:\nToday we have NS or UIControls, which are Views, and Have UIEvents. Itâ€™s hard for us to create our own custom elements that play nice with interface builders IBActions. Most controls just have a static set of events.\n\nI would like to see the next generation of cocoa introduce a notion of Components and Events as first class citizens. Component is not necessarily a UI element. A component is a type that has event properties. With this concept we can create any type of component that has events, which are observable.\n\nA UIComponent is a view that is also a Component. So a UIComponent is a nicely wrapped up piece of UI that represents an encapsulated set of behaviors. The events of a UIComponent can be wired up in interface builder like we do today with UIControls.\n\nThe benefits are:\n- We now have observable events \n- We can create custom non UI components that can be used in interface builder.\n- We can create custom reusable pieces of UI that are not just IBInspectable, but also can play nice with the target action pattern\n- Sophisticated pieces of UI can be encapsulated without the ViewController bloat we see today where application logic gets all up in the view layers business."
