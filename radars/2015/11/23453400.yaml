    description: "The once-reputable macupdate.com site has started trying to sneak adware onto its users' computers. More information about this is available at:\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.org/news/2015/11/has-macupdate-fallen-to-the-adware-plague/\r\n\r\nI was able to independently confirm the findings in that article. \r\n\r\nThis seems like exactly the kind of problem Developer ID was meant to solve. If a developer is trying to trick a user into installing junk onto his or her Mac, Developer ID should stop the user from doing so.\r\n\r\nThis is the code signing information I was able to get from the installer:\r\n\r\n$ codesign -vvv -d MacUpdate\\ Installer.app/\r\nExecutable=/Users/jbrayton/Desktop/MacUpdate Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/pretransmit\r\nIdentifier=com.greasily.germule\r\nFormat=bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64)\r\nCodeDirectory v=20200 size=7964 flags=0x0(none) hashes=391+3 location=embedded\r\nHash type=sha1 size=20\r\nCDHash=03077e331e3d6ad718653356b03e52dc0007147e\r\nSignature size=8525\r\nAuthority=Developer ID Application: Herbert Lakin (RYFK6YL6C6)\r\nAuthority=Developer ID Certification Authority\r\nAuthority=Apple Root CA\r\nTimestamp=Oct 18, 2015, 10:14:14 AM\r\nInfo.plist entries=28\r\nTeamIdentifier=RYFK6YL6C6\r\nSealed Resources version=2 rules=12 files=51\r\nInternal requirements count=1 size=180"
