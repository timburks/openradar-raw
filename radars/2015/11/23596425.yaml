        Summary:
        When configuring a UIView with a UIAttachmentBehavior, there appears to be no way to change the rate at which the swing decelerates. Setting the frictionTorque and damping properties on the attachment behavior has no effect.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Build and run the attached sample project in the simulator
        2. Observe how the blue box swings
        3. Tap Add Friction
        4. Tap Add Damping

        Expected Results:
        Steps 3 and 4 each slow down the swinging (or deceleration of) of the blue box

        Actual Results:
        The blue box swings at the same rate (and slows down at the same rate) regardless of whether the damping and frictionTorque are 0 or 1,000,000
