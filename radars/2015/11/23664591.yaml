    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a loginwindow profile has has \"Disable Automatic Login\" enabled, that computer cannot use Migration Assistant.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Configure a destination computer with MacOS 10.11.1.  Install a Profile that manages Loginwindow, with the \"Disable Automatic Login\" checkbox enabled (set to true).\r\n2) Attach a source computer via Target Disk Mode.\r\n3) Run Migration Assistant on the destination computer.\r\n4) Provide requested administrator credentials.\r\n5) Computer will exit to loginwindow\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter authenticating within Migration Assistant, application would proceed to step of selecting source to migrate from.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nComputer returns to loginwindow.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nConfirmed by me to happen under 10.11.1, using Profile created via Apple's Profile Manager.  Confirmed by others that the parallel option within JAMF's Casper can also induce the same crash.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nConfirmed that replacing the existing profile with one that removed the Disable Automatic Login option allowed Migration Assistant to proceed as expected."
