        Summary:
        I want to use the Relationships feature, it seems like such a no-brainer to use, yet it has almost no purpose on OSX or iOS. You can specify the fields (albeit very slowly on OSX for some reason), or link them on iOS but they only get stored as text values, while they could be stored as references to the UUID of the other card.

        It would be nice to see a graphical representation of relationships, but that might be too much to ask, just having functionality that actually links to the vcards would be great.

        On iOS you can even select the card, but it will only store a textual reference.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a Contact "Rose" in Contacts (Address Book was the better name)
        Create a Contact "The Doctor" in Contacts
        Edit Contact "The Doctor" to add a "Companion" field and specify Rose her vcard.

        Expected Results:
        The Doctor's vcard to contain an actual link to Rose's vcard, as specified in the spec [0]

        Actual Results:
        The Doctor's vcard got the following extra information:

              item4.X-ABRELATEDNAMES;type=pref:Rose
              item4.X-ABLabel:_$!<Companion>!$_

        Regression:
