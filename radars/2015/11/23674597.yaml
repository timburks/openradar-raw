        Summary:
        If a lot of applications are open, clicking restart never JustWorks®, it always involves me having to force quit or quit some applications.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Mac
        2. Do computering
        3. Put mac to sleep
        4. Do more computering
        5. Click restart

        Expected Results:
        The computer restarts.

        Actual Results:
        The computer closes some apps, but stalls on a lot of them.

        Regression:
        Haven't seen restart working reliably since Snow Leopard, it probably lost data in every app that was open when clicking restart, but it was fast and it was reliable.
