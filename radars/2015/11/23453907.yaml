    description: "Summary:\r\nI believe the tvOS App Store is not searchable via Siri. This seems odd to me because App Store results do appear when manually using the Search app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Search app.\r\n2. Type \"bingo\".\r\n3. See search results, including apps in the app store, whose name includes the word \"bingo\".\r\n4. Hold down the Siri button and say \"search for bingo\" \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to see the same search results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see some search results, but none that are apps in the App Store. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I hold down the Siri remote and say \"search the app store for bingo\", I get a message that says \"Sorry, I can't do that for you.\""
