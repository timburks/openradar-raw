    description: "Summary:\r\nA single contact has 2 forms of contact information - an email and a phone number that both can go to their iMessage.  However on my iOS device, this contact is separated into 2 separate conversations, whereas on my mac all the conversations from this contact is correct consolidate into one thread.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a contact with a phone number that has iMessage enabled.\r\n2. Start a conversation with this contact from the phone number by clicking the message button in the contact card next to the phone number\r\n3. Add an email address that also has iMessage enabled\r\n4. Start a conversation from this email by clicking on the message button associated with the phone number\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niMessage should know that the 2nd message is associated with the same contact and should be a continuation of the conversation instead of a new one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niMessage creates a new conversation thread treating the conversation with the same contact as two separate entities :P \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis doesn’t happen on my Mac, I don’t know of any workaround on iOS that can get the system to consolidate the conversations."
