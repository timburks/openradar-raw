    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a 4th-gen Apple TV I can choose whether I would like to require entering my Apple ID password a) never, b) after 15 minutes c) always. Whatâ€™s missing is an option to always require it on consumables. This could be added to other devices as well but is especially needed on Apple TV where entering the password is such a pain and no TouchID is available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on the Apple TV\r\n2. Find a six-year-old\r\n3. Hand them the remote\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThey inadvertently spent $500 on stuff I can actually keep like apps, movies, TV shows or in-app non-consumable items.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey inadvertently spent $500 on worthless in-app consumables like coins."
