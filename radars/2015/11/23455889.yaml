        Summary:
        Some frameworks like CoreGraphics use a custom log function like CGPostError for logging API issues. This is very useful, as one can set a breakpoint to it.

        UIKit, on the other hand, simply uses NSLog. Since NSLog is used everywhere, it’s very hard to set a breakpoint and not be interrupted all the time. I’m not aware of a way a breakpoint could be set that only logs if it’s within UIKit. A much simpler and better way would be to use a function like UIKitLogError that forwards to NSLog. There’s basically no performance penalty and this can be done without breaking backwards compatibility. This would make debugging a lot easier.
