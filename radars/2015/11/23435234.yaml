    description: "Summary:\r\nSee the attached project + video. Basically we are just displaying a WKWebView and navigating to google.ca and at some point it decides to scroll to the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nStackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33445988/wkwebview-content-jumping-on-load\r\nPotentially related problem Mozilla is having: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1219241\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust run the project in the simulator or on a device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n0 scroll position (top of page), not overlapped by header\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a slight delay (1-2 seconds) the page jumps down.\r\n\r\nOn my simulator (iPhone 6 - iOS 9.1) it seems to jump all the way to the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nOn a device (iPhone 6 - iOS 9.0) it seems to just ignore the header bar and the view starts at the top of the screen. If I scroll up and let go, it'll scroll back down so that google's page header is underneath the app's header.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B137), iOS 9.0 (13A344)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 simulator (iOS 9.1). iPhone 6 device (iOS 9.0)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ScrollingHack.zip' and 'GoogleScrollJump.mov' were successfully uploaded."
