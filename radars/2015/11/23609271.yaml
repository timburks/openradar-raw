    description: "Summary:\r\nI am an agent of an iOS development organisation, and Xcode 7 has also created a free (personal) team.\r\n\r\nAt some point in development, I must've selected this personal team.  No provisioning profiles were found, and naturally I selected \"Fix Issue\".\r\n\r\nI now want to test push notifications with this app, and I find I can't because I can't create the relevant app ID on the Apple Developer Portal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Ensure under your non-free team, your app ID & associated provisioning profiles are deleted.\r\n2.  Select your project in the project navigator.\r\n3.  Under your target, select your personal team.\r\n4.  It should say no provisioning profiles are found - click fix issue.\r\n5.  Sign into the Apple Developer portal.\r\n6.  Try to create an app ID, selecting some options like iCloud, Push Notifications, App Groups, etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to create the app ID, or at least have a way to delete the app ID used on the free team.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can't create the app ID, and I can't delete the used app ID on the free team.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.x (certainly 7.1.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo work around, I have to use a different app bundle ID, which is frustrating!"
