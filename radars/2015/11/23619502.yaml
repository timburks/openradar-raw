    description: "Summary:\r\nFind cannot currently 'see' User Defined Runtime Attributes in Interface Builder files.\r\n\r\nThis makes a Global Find slightly less global.\r\n\r\nI use UDRAs extensively in my project and adding this feature would make Xcode's Find-ing capabilities far more complete and capable. (It seems like this is one of the last places I can't 'see' with Find, these days.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project which includes a Storyboard or Xib file.\r\n\r\n2. Assign a User Defined Runtime Attribute somewhere in that file\r\n\r\n3. Perform a Find that includes this file, using a string that should match some element of the attribute previously set (i.e. the keyPath or value, etc)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind identifies that string in the Interface Builder file (like it does other Interface Builder elements)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind does not identify that string in the Interface Builder file\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
