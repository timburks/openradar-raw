        A long-standing, really annoying bug in OS X which, when triggers, prevents the user from using the system, unless SecurityAgent is killed using Activity Monitor.

        The problem happens, sometimes, when trying to flag an SSL cert to be trusted “always.” The window appears, prompting the user to login to authenticate changes to the Certificate Trust Settings, but it’s not possible to type in the window. Beachball spins indefinitely.

        This is also discussed in detail in this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6300609
