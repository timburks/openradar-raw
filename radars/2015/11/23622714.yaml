    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice if the type casting operator accepted expressions on its right side.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe type casting operator only accepts types and can't process expressions on its right side.\r\n\r\nHaving a class A, and a subclass of A, B:\r\n\r\nclass A {}\r\nclass B: A {}\r\n\r\nAnd a function that returns the passed type:\r\n\r\nfunc type<T: A>(t: T.Type) -> T.Type {\r\n    return t\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe following scenario works:\r\n\r\nlet b = B()\r\nlet a = (b as A)\r\n\r\nHowever the following scenario doesn't:\r\n\r\nlet b = B()\r\nlet a = (b as type(A))\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1.1 & Swift 2.1"
