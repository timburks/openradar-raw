    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Release Note text file for OS X doesn't include what was actually changed in the latest build.  It only includes: \"The OS X [Title] [Build] update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac.\"; Installation Instructions; Focus Areas; Bug Reporting and Legal Notices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI wanted to request that the Release Note text files contain information related to which bugs, either by number or by type, that were fixed.  For example, Fixed in Beta [Number]: Bug Reports XXXXXXX, XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX; Updated in Beta [Number]: Bug Reports XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX.  Or in Beta [Number] we fixed X number or issues related to the Mail app which included Messages would appear upside down in rare cases; we fixed X number of issues related to the USB hardware which left several users unable to use portable hard drives.  The layout could be similar to the iOS Release Notes with Fixed and Known bugs.\r\n\r\nWe Developers know that you are aiming to patch security issues and increase the overall speed and performance of the Mac platform each version, but what we really want to know is, did our and other user's reported bug(s) get fixed or not.  If our bug or our type of bug wasn't listed in the latest Release Notes, then we will know that we don't need to spend the data/time to download the update and we can just wait for the next build and check again.  It's also nice to know about fixes that were done that aren't necessarily related to what we submitted.  I didn't submit any problems related to Wi-Fi, but I'm glad to see Wi-Fi problem X was fixed in this version.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRight now there is very little bug patch data included in each Release Note text file and I think it would be nice if those text files were a little more verbose in telling us what was fixed and/or is known.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nDocumentation Title:  OS X [Number] [Build] Release Notes  URL:  https://developer.apple.com/osx/download/\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
