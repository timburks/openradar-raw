    description: "A protocol has a typealias. An extension to that protocol specifies a concrete type for that typealias, but it's self-referential, the Swift compiler crashes.\r\n\r\ne.g. `typealias MyAlias = (i: Int, a: MyAlias)`\r\n\r\n...but not that obvious, you have to be more indrect about it. Kind of hard to explain; See attached playground file.\r\n\r\nSwift code: https://gist.github.com/joshhinman/77fe8045fe10fe9e27cd"
