        When using a custom push/pop transition, UINavigationBar automatically cross-fades the title and bar button items. (And that's fine in most cases.)

        However I'd like a way to opt into the standard shift animation of UINavigationBar.

        I made a transition that is fairly similar to the standard push/pop transition but also works well for semi-transparent views. Now I also have to reinvent the wheel by mimicking the system navigation bar animation! (Which is hard because UINavigationBar doesn't expose the views in order to animate them.)
