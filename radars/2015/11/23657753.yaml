        Summary:
        If you‘re using Split View multitasking on an iPad, and the app in the right pane calls exit(), both apps will quit.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. On iPad, open an app that support split view multitasking (the “Main” app)
        2. Open another app using Split View multitasking (the “Other” app)
        3. Cause the “Other” app to call exit()

        Expected Results:
        The split view multitasking pane disappears, but the “Main” app is still present.

        Actual Results:
        The iPad returns to the home screen.

        Notes:
        See attached video and sample project.
