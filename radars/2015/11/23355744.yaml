        The bug I found is similar to 21961293 but not exactly the same. It happens for a custom popping navigation transition for UINavigationController. My app is very complex and I havenâ€™t been able to make a producible sample project yet.

        The behavior is like this:
        1. On a pushed view controller with table view, over pull upward so that rubber band animation will begin after releasing the finger.
        2. Start panning edge to interactively pop the view controller as soon as releasing the over-pulling finger.
        3. Finish popping by calling finishInteractiveTransition.
        4. The completion block of -[UIView animateWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completion] is never called.
