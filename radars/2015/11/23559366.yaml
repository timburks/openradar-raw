    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery time I execute something in the debugger console, Xcode crashes.\r\n\r\nUsing Swift 2 and Xcode Version 7.1.1 (7B1005). \r\n\r\nI can't think of much more information that's relevant, but I'm sure there's more, so please do ask me if there's anything I should add to my question that would help.\r\n\r\nI've of course cleaned build and derived data.\r\n\r\nIt's driving me and other developers insane:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/33232867/xcode-7-crash-every-time-i-try-to-print-something-in-the-debugger-console\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set breakpoint in project\r\n2. Run project\r\n3. Hit breakpoint\r\n4. `po` something in the debugger\r\n5. CRASH\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ndata description printed in the debugging console\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.1.1 (7B1005)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe project is not very big, and has less than 10 third party frameworks. I've got a very small project, and Xcode doesn't crash when I use the debugger with this one. But I've compared the project settings, and can't find a difference between the two that causes the crash.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'xcode.crash' was successfully uploaded."
