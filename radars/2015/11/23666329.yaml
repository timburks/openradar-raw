    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI’m quite confident that there is something wrong with tap detection on the screen, somewhere in watchOS or underlying firmware. I’ve asked all my friends who have Apple Watches and they agree.\r\n\r\nPlease don’t think I’m crazy because I can’t give good reliable reproduction steps. I’ve owned almost every iPhone and 3 iPads and I’ve never had a problem with it registering my taps.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes when I touch an on-screen button, it just doesn’t recognize it. I notice it the most when I try to tap End Workout. I usually press that thing like 3 or 4 times before it registers, and I need to do it more deliberately. Granted, this is when I’m breathing heavily and maybe with a  sweaty finger, but I feel like something in there needs to be more forgiving.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, I can feel like I can see the on-screen button move like it was touched, but it doesn’t activate. But maybe I’m imagining that.\r\n\r\nI’d recommend watching some users in a lab on a treadmill trying to end a workout and see if they have trouble pressing the button."
