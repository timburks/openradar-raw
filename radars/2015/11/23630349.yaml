    description: "Summary:\r\nI was looking up the quick help documentation for NSDecimalNumber notANumber in Swift and noticed it's availability was iOS 8.1. However going into an Objective-C file the availability appears as iOS 2.\r\n\r\nThis is not just that method. NSDateFormatter stringFromDate also says iOS 8.1 when it's also iOS 2.\r\n\r\nBasically all the quick help documentation in Swift files shows the incorrect availability version number.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift and Objc file.\r\n2. Use same method.\r\n3. Option + click to open the quick documentation.\r\n4. See that availability versions are different\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the availability version to be the same for the same method in Objc and Swift files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey are not the same, and Swift lies (which caused me a slight panic since we still support iOS 7).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1 (7B91b) & OS X 10.10.5 (14F1021)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll the time\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-11-20 at 9.40.31 AM.png', 'Screen Shot 2015-11-20 at 9.40.49 AM.png' and 'Screen Shot 2015-11-20 at 9.43.26 AM.png' were successfully uploaded."
