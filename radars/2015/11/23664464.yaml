    description: "Summary:\n\nIf my laptop is attached to an external display and external keyboard, when I close it, the laptop should not go to sleep.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Get a laptop running OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or later\n2. Attach an external display, keyboard, and mouse\n3. Do NOT attach a power adapter\n4. Close the laptop\n\nExpected Results:\n\nI expect my Mac to stay awake and functional via the external display and keyboard.\n\nActual Results:\n\nThe Mac goes to sleep and will not wake up until I open it.\n\nRegression:\n\nThis is new behavior in OS X 10.11. It occurs on a wide variety of hardware and is easily reproducible \n\nNotes:\n\nThis new behavior is documented in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834 which says:\n\n```\nRequirements for closed-display mode\r\r• Power adapter\r• External keyboard, mouse, or trackpad\r• External display\r```\n\nIt doesn’t make sense for “power adapter” to be a requirement. The only reason for this feature is so users don’t walk away by accident and their battery dies. But this is solvable without requiring a power adapter by making the laptop go to sleep if it’s not touched (like when it’s open)."
