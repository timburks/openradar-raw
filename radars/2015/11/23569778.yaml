    description: "Summary:\r\nI have three accounts that are backed by gmail (personal, work, and school). They are all @ different domains, but they all use imap.gmail.com as their mail server. When one of them has a connection issue or a wrong password, I can’t tell which one is having the problem from the dialog presented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have three Mail.app accounts configured that all use the same mail server. Mine are @gmail.com, @raizlabs.com, and @maine.edu, which are all backed by Gmail.\r\n2. Have a wrong password or some other kind of configuration error that results in the inability of one of the accounts to connect.\r\n3. Try to get mail, either via pull to refresh or wait for auto-refresh.\r\n4. Get popup describing the error:\r\n\r\nCannot Get Mail\r\nThe mail server “imap.gmail.com” is not responding. Verify that you have entered the correct account info in Mail settings.\r\n[OK] button\r\n\r\n5. Try to figure out which account is having problems.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe error dialog says *which* account is having the problem. In addition to an OK button, there is a button that takes me to Settings, and even better, *to the correct account*.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialog does not make it clear which account is having the error, and does not provide any way to figure it out. You have to go into Settings and manually turn accounts on and off until you figure it out yourself.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot also posted at http://cl.ly/dpps"
