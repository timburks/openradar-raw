    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing an Objective-C enum (backed by `NSUInteger`) in Swift is not working. Xcode shows any swift property of the type of this enum as it has no values defined (= a case of the enum) . See image attachments and test project that you can run.\r\n\r\nCode is the following:\r\n\r\nIn Objective-C â€” State.h\r\n```objc\r\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\r\n\r\ntypedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, State) {\r\n\tStateDraft,\r\n\tStateSent,\r\n\tStateInvalid,\r\n\tStateWaitingForUpload,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Bridging Header file:\r\n```objc\r\n#import \"State.h\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Swift:\r\n```swift\r\nlet state = State.Sent\r\n_ = state // breakpoint here: po state gives an error (error: <EXPR>:1:1: error: use of unresolved identifier 'state')\r\nprint(state)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 7.1 (7B91b)\r\n2. Create an enum in Objective-C (as in the project in attachment)\r\n3. Add the enum file to the bridge file for using in Swift\r\n4. Create a Swift file that declares and instantiate a property of the type of the enum created in step 2\r\n5. Execute and check the value of this property\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe property should have the value of the enum that it's been given.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe property has no value and is in an \"undefined\" state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1 (7B91b) - OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 (15B42)"
