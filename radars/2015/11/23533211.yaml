        Being able to create animated state changes by activating/deactivating sets of constraints on a view is very powerful.

        Currently, I have no way of visually seeing the result of this in Interface Builder as I have to manually install/uninstall constraints (also, there is an inconsistency between install/uninstall in IB and .active in Swift/Cocoa.)

        It would be great if I could create a constraint group in IB with an Active option that I could turn on/off to quickly see the states of my animation.

        I’ll be releasing an app soon that uses this technique (although I’m sure this workflow is not unique to me). Happy to chat through it if you want to.
