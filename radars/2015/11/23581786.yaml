    description: "Summary:\r\nI wanted to request an update to the Bug Reporter that would allow one to check a box, similar to the Resolved checkbox, to inform Apple that a Status Update has been requested for a Bug Report.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCreate a checkbox, similar to the Resolved checkbox, that would notify the Bug Reporters that a Status Update has been requested.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently, text must be entered into the Add new information field.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the documentation(1) on requesting a Status Update seems vague so I assumed that it needed to be added as new/additional information to the Bug Report itself.\r\n\r\n(1)Documentation Webpage:  https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/using-bug-reporter/  Under Subheading: Submitting a Report; Sentence 5.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
