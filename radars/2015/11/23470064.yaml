    description: "Summary:\r\nLarge organizations often have a single bank of numbers: Inside an Area Code, they will own one (or more) three-digit Central Office codes. It would be helpful to assign a CO number a nickname, so iPhone can identify a caller Company even if the individual line is unknown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a call from e.g. Shure Incorporated 847-600-xxxx\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Receive a call that displays \"Shure Inc.\" Because I assigned that for all unknown callers from 847-600\r\n2. Pick it up promptly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Receive a call from e.g. Shure Incorporated 847-600-xxxx\r\n2. Wonder If this is a spam caller\r\n3. Realize 600 is actually a Shure landline number\r\n4. Pick up a co-workers call after it rang too long\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C5060d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
