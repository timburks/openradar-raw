    description: "Summary:\nI have a static library that is shared between Mac and iOS targets. I want to set its “bitcode enabled” setting to only be enabled for iphones* SDKs, as the feature is broken in simulator and outright disallowed on Mac. However, the menu item “Add Conditional Setting” is always disabled, no matter what build setting is selected, or in which target it is selected.\n\nI also tried to create an xcconfig file like so: \nENABLE_BITCODE[sdk=iphoneos*] = YES\nENABLE_BITCODE[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = NO\nENABLE_BITCODE[sdk=macosx*] = NO\n\nbut it seems like Xcode did not enjoy this:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xhg1kzvmheq5qzx/Screenshot%202015-11-18%2014.00.43.png?dl=0"
