    description: "Summary:\r\nMany builds uploaded to iTunes Connect get stuck in a 'Processing' state and never exit that state. We can't tell why these builds stay stuck in that state. Because they stay in that state, they are not available for testing, and this hampers our ability to ship high quality applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload a build to iTunes Connect\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build is available for internal testing, external testing, and review in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMany times the build stays in a 'Processing' state, and is never available for internal testing, external testing, or review.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a huge blocker for our continued use of TestFlight. If we can't be sure that builds we upload are going to be available, it doesn't encourage us to use the system.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
