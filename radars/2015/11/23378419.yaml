    description: "This was resolved in Xcode 7.1.1.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm unable to profile my app while it is running on a device, because the device is grayed out and unavailable in Instruments Target drop down.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select my device (iPhone 6 running iOS 9.1) as the run destination in Xcode.\r\n2. Choose Product->Profile in Xcode.\r\n3. Choose the Leaks template in the Instruments template selector window that appears.\r\n4. Note that the record button is disabled.\r\n5. Click on the target selector to select the connected iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can select my connected iPhone in order to profile the app running on it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can select my Mac and my Apple Watch as targets. My iPhone is grayed out. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis occurs in both the release version of Xcode/Instruments 7.1 on two different machines, and in Xcode/Instruments 7.2 beta 2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy app's primarily functionality, including that which I'm trying to profile, does not work on the simulator due to its reliance on MediaPlayer.framework."
