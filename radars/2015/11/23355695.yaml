        Summary:
        When defining new subtypes, you should be able to define them on an outer scope with the right hierarchy specified in the name.
        e.g.
        struct Foo {}
        struct Foo.Bar {}

        Currently you have to declare them inside the original type, either at declaration time or with an extension.
        e.g.
        struct Foo {
          struct Bar {}
        }
        or
        struct FooÂ {}
        extension Foo {
          struct Bar {}
        }

        Expected Results:
        To be able to declare Foo.Bar as a subtype of Foo

        Actual Results:
        It doesn't compile

        Regression:
        None.
