    description: "Summary:\r\nSince there are no dedicated cycling directions on Apple Maps, I choose walking directions because they often yield the better cycling routes and driving directions sometimes direct you to highways where cycling isn’t allowed. However, I’ve found Apple Maps sometimes automatically switches from walking to driving directions when it detects a certain velocity (or route?). It would be great for cyclists like me if it didn’t do that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Hop on your bicycle.\r\n2. Ask yourself: Why would anyone drive a car when they can cycle?\r\n3. Use Apple Maps driving directions\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStill ask yourself: Why would anyone drive a car when they can cycle?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAsk yourself: What was Apple thinking optimizing their Maps app for polluting vehicles rather than non-polluting ones. Isn’t Al Gore on their board?\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
