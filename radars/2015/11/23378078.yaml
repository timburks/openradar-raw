    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile in the middle of a rowing workout, if I get a message, it will never go away until I intervene, halting my workout. I think that the rowing motion is causing the screen to wake up frequently enough (I typically row around 25 strokes per minute) that it never times out and goes back to the workout app. This prevents me from tracking my time or heart rate until I interact with the watch using my other hand.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Workout app, begin a Rowing workout\r\n2. Begin rowing, around 25 strokes per minute\r\n3. Receive a message\r\n4. Glance at the message\r\n5. Resume rowing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter some time (e.g. 30 seconds) I'm back in the Workout app, viewing my workout stats-in-progress\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message stays up until I dismiss it"
