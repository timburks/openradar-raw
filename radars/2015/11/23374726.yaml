        Summary:
        My app uses a 3rd-party framework, that the distribute unsigned. My build copies and signs the framework. It produces an archive that validates fine when I produce an Archive build from Xcode on my desktop, but when I validate an archive produced by a Bot integration, I get the error “Multiple binaries share the same codesign path”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Get a checkout of the attached source (add to your own Git repo, or checkout from https://github.com/abbeycode/PaddleFrameworkIssue.git)
        2. Produce an Archive build
        3. From the Organizer, click “Validate…”
        4. Select “Validate for the Mac App Store”
        5. Click “Next”
        6. Click through the rest of the prompts
        7. Create a Bot for the project, with all the default settings (though you can turn off tests and analysis – only the Archive is required)
        8. Integrate with the new Bot
        9. Save the integration’s archive to the Organizer
        10. From the Organizer, click “Validate…”
        11. Select “Validate for the Mac App Store”
        12. Click “Next”

        Expected Results:
        After step 6, the archive validates successfully. After step 12, the rest of the prompts appear and the archive validates successfully

        Actual Results:
        After step 12, an error sheet displays, showing a “multiple binaries share the same path” error, as detailed in the attached validation logs

        Notes:
        Using OS X 10.10.5, Server 4.1.3, Xcode 6.4. I’ve attached the code, the logs produced by the validator, and the server build logs
