        Summary:
        The version of XCTest shipped in Xcode 7.2b3 (7C62) references the following symbols:

        -[XCSymbolicationRecord softLinkCoreSymbolication]
        -[XCTestDriver _softlinkDTXConnectionServices]

        Their capitalization is mismatched. It’d be nicer if they matched.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run otool on “Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/Library/Frameworks/XCTest.framework/Versions/A/XCTest”, look at the referenced symbols.

        Expected Results:
        “softLink” uses the same capitalization.

        Actual Results:
        “softLink” and “softlink” both appear.

        Regression:
        No, these have been misspelled since they were introduced in Xcode 6.0.1.

        Notes:
        None.
