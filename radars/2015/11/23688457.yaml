    description: "Summary:\nAs part of working with Automator, I've been leveraging the ability of Automator's Ask for Finder Items action to set text prompts in my Automator-based applications. \n\nThese text prompts are included in the appropriate Finder windows and have been an easy way for me to set a particular message in an application window.\n\nI recently noticed that these in OS X El Capitan that these messages no longer appear, which is a bit inconvenient as it leaves new users of my applications with no clear direction as to what to do.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Build Automator workflow which includes Automator's Ask for Finder Items action\n2. Set text into the Prompt: section of the Ask for Finder Items action\n3. Run the Automator workflow\n\nExpected Results:\n\nIn the Ask for Finder Items window, I expected to see the text that I had set into the Prompt: section of the Ask for Finder Items action.\n\nActual Results:\n\nI did not see the text that I had set into the Prompt: section of the Ask for Finder Items action.\n\nRegression:\n\n\nNotes:\n\nIâ€™ve attached a screenshot showing how Automator's Ask for Finder Items window appears on both El Capitan and Yosemite."
