    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Dock, when hidden, doesn't immediately show when bumped or hovered over after restarting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0.  The \"Automatically hide and show the Dock\" option is checked inside the System Preferences.  The Dock is located on the bottom of the screen.\r\n1.  Start up Mac.\r\n2.  After the desktop background and Apple logo cross fade, I move the cursor to the bottom of the screen to unhide the Dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImmediately after start up, move the mouse to the bottom of the screen and the Dock should unhide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mouse must be moved down to the bottom of the screen and the Dock must be bumped or hovered over twice in order for the Dock to unhide.  Mission Control can also be used to make the Dock unhide.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Mavericks, OS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8 contained the expected results.  This glitch can be consistently reproduced by running killall Dock from the Terminal.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOn OS X Mavericks, this bug always occurs when Software Updates are installed and requires a Safe Boot to fix.  The same results are true on OS X Yosemite.  On OS X El Capitan, this bug seems to have a higher likelihood of occurring on Macs that are newer than 2012 (ones that have support for the Metal API) and on Macs that have Intel or ATI/AMD graphics cards.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
