    description: "[Want to discuss? Get in touch with me @jamesreggio.]\r\n\r\nWhen an instance of SFSafariViewController is first presented within an app, its view will render as a blank white screen for less than a second, but long enough for a human to notice. This behavior consistently occurs for the first use of an SFSafariViewController within an app, but then occurs less often (possibly because the remote process is already 'warm').\r\n\r\nConsult the video below for a demonstration of the repro within an iPhone 6S Plus emulator running iOS 9.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Cold reboot the emulator.\r\n2. Load the app referenced below.\r\n3. Tap the '200' button in the 'Modal' row. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe modal renders with a status bar and toolbar immediately upon presentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe modal renders blank for the first 100–300 ms, and then the status bar and toolbar appear.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B137)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample project is available on GitHub here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jamesreggio/SFSafariViewControllerPlayground\r\n\r\nThe video demonstrating the repro is available on Dropbox here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0occ1urds3gzfor/2015-11-16-sfsafariviewcontroller-blank-screen-repro.mov?dl=0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus on iOS 9.1 (13B137)"
