    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to enable FileVault 2 for the first time, you were previously able (in 10.9 and 10.10) to add the -authrestart flag in the command in order to seamlessly enable FileVault and boot back into the OS. Since the release of 10.11 Build 15A284, this feature no longer works and returns the following error: \"Error: A problem occurred while trying to enable FileVault. (22)\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Erase disk on machine from NetBoot environment with terminal command \"diskutil cs delete LVG UUID\"\r\n2. Reinstall Mac OS 10.11 using Recovery HD and Mac App Store download\r\n3. Boot into OS, open terminal and run the following command \"fdesetup enable -authrestart\"\r\n4. After running the command, you are prompted for the username and password of the user you want to enable on the disk\r\n5. You are presented with the error noted in the description and brought back to the command prompt.\r\n6. If you run the command \"fdesetup enable\" without the \"-authrestart\" flag, it will enable FileVault as expected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Erase disk on machine from NetBoot environment with terminal command \"diskutil cs delete LVG UUID\"\r\n2. Reinstall Mac OS 10.11 using Recovery HD and Mac App Store download\r\n3. Boot into OS, open terminal and run the following command \"fdesetup enable -authrestart\"\r\n4. After running the command, fill in the information for the user you would like to enable on the disk (username and password)\r\n5. The computer reboots and passes through the FileVault EFI Login screen and you are presented with the OS Login Window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter being prompted for the username and password of the user you would like to enable to unlock the disk, you are presented with the error \"Error: A problem occurred while trying to enable FileVault. (22)\" and FileVault is not enabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on 2 separate OS versions:\r\n1. 10.11 (15A284)\r\n2. 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis was tested on 2 separate machines:\r\n1. Macbook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015)\r\n2. Macbook Air (11-inch, Mid 2012)"
