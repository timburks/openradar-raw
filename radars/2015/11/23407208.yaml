    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I go for a walk late at night, I'd like my steps to count for the day in which I started the walk rather than always resetting at midnight. I'd like to set my day to reset at, say, 4:00 AM in the morning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo out for a walk at 11:30 pm. Note how the first 30 minutes of your walk count towards the first day, and then the counter resets as soon as the clock strikes midnight.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like to be able to set the day to end at, for example, 4:00 AM.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe day always starts at midnight.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iOS 9.1, Health App (or Pedometer++, which uses HealthKit)"
