    description: "There’s this nice new feature in iOS 9 that reminds you when it’s time to leave for an upcoming appointment or that tells you at the moment you usually leave work when you’ll be home.\r\nHowever, this feature never asks me whether I intend to go by train, bus, bike, bicycle or car and just assumes I’d use the car, which, for me, is never the case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take the bus to your appointment\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour phone already knew you’d take the bus and told you to leave ahead of time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou’ll be late because your phone assumed you’d take the car which you don’t even have since you don’t like polluting the environment.\r\n\r\nNext time you’ll cycle but then you’ll be much too early because your phone assumed you’d be in a car that is much more affected by traffic conditions than a bicycle."
