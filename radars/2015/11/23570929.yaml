    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCurrently Xcode's \"Page guide at column\" setting can only be configured in Preferences -> Text Editing. Because many projects have different style guides in terms of maximum line lengths, it would be idea if you could configure this setting in the project file, similar to indent settings."
