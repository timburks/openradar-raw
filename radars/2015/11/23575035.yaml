    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using your iPhone, if an incoming phone call comes in, it should not overtake the entire device screen. Instead, it should appear like a standard iOS notification, and the user can decide if they want to answer or decline the call without interfering with the normal use of the device.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior was especially annoying for me when I was in the middle of taking a panoramic photo and received a phone call. The phone call ended my photo taking session, and the Camera app stopped taking the photo (which makes sense as I could no longer see the camera viewfinder), and it ruined my photo. If the phone call was a standard notification, I could've finished up taking the panorama photo, and then answered the phone call. Instead, I was just left with an incomplete panorama photo.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use your iPhone\r\n2. Receive an incoming phone call\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe incoming phone call notification should not overtake the entire screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe incoming phone call notification does overtake the entire screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis may need to be a setting, but it's 2015, and even though the device is called iPhone, we all know that a lot of people do not frequently make or receive phone calls. The phone call should no longer have its special notification status."
