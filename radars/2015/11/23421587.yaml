        Summary:
        If you are writing a new message in full screen mode in Mail, click on someone's email address and use the "Search for <person's name>" item in the contextual menu there, the search is performed in the message viewer window in the background, but the results are not visible because they are obscured by the message window.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Put a viewer window into full screen mode
        2. Click the "New Message" button
        3. Type someone's name into the "To" field and let Mail "tokenize" it
        4. Click on the arrow to the right of the person's name and choose the "Search for <person's name>" item in the menu that appears.

        Expected Results:
        Mail should perform the search in the viewer window, and minimize the message window to the bottom of the screen so that I can see the results of the search I just did.

        Actual Results:
        The message window remains up, obscuring most of the viewer window, including the results of the search. The only visual indication that a search was performed at all is the person's name appearing in the search field in the upper right.
