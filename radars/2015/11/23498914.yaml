        Summary:
        Since Xcode 7 I have been unable to refactor even the most basic things. In Xcode 6 I could refactor class names, protocols, properties, variables, methods. Now, when attempting to refactor either Xcode fails or it gives me the preview pane with nothing to show and no changes made at all.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In Xcode try to refactor any of the aforementioned items. Watch it fail miserably and not refactor anything at all.

        Expected Results:
        Be able to refactor like in Xcode 6 or, say, any other IDE!

        Actual Results:
        Only the item I selected is renamed, the rest result in warnings because the renamed property, method, etc., no longer match the name.

        Regression:
        Yes, this was not happening in Xcode 6 and I was able to rename items without much problem.

        Notes:
        Please fix it! :(
