        The custom configurable complications on the Apple Watch are one of the most useful features. It allows you to quickly see “dashboard” information at a glance. They also make it easy to launch apps from the watch face.

        The Apple TV screensaver should have the same functionality. This would allow us to turn any panel into a digital dashboard. When the screen saver turns on, or with a user gesture, a set of complications could animate to overlay the screen. This would be useful for checking the time, weather, and endless third party app use cases, such as sports scores, stock prices, etc. etc.

        Please see attachment.
