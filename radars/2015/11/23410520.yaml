    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode requires for <source> tags to be exactly identical to the strings in Interface Builder. This cannot be guaranteed because services like POEditor.com let you change the contents of the source if you e.g. change the English text.\r\n\r\nXcode should ignore the <source> tags for importing translations and only use the translation identifier for imports belonging to base-localization XIBs and storyboards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a label that contains text with several line breaks in the middle\r\n2. Export XLIFF\r\n3. Import XLIFF in POEditor.com\r\n4. Add German localization\r\n5. Export translated XLIFF \r\n6. Import XLIFF into Xcode\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the blog post I mention in the notes for a much more detailed chain of events including screenshots that cause the issue.\r\n\r\nYou can also reproduce it with the sample app I have attached. This is steps 1-5 executed from the steps above.\r\n\r\n1. Open the project\r\n2. Import German.xliff from the project folder\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The translated multi-paragraph text should be present\r\n- There should be 5 strings in the newly created Main.strings (German)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The translated multi-paragraph text shows up in the translation diff view\r\n- but it is missing from the resulting German strings file\r\n- only if you replace the contents in the <source> node with the exact string from the export, then the translation shows up \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.1 (7B91b), OS X 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have documented the entire chain of the problem here: https://www.cocoanetics.com/2015/11/the-case-of-the-missing-translation/"
