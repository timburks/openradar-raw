    description: "I am near-sighted. I need glasses to drive, and I need them to watch presentations in a conference room setting. Beyond that I typically do not wear my glasses, certainly not to watch TV.\r\n\r\nWithout my glasses, I find it difficult to read a lot of text on the Apple TV. Specifically, I find it difficult to read text such as:\r\n* App descriptions in the app store\r\n* Descriptions of movies available for sale via iTunes\r\n* Descriptions of tv shows available for sale via iTunes\r\n* The names of apps on the home screen (mitigated by icons)\r\n* TV Show titles under Purchased TV Shows (mitigated by images)\r\n\r\nThe bold text accessibility setting does not help me. I think the problems I have are a combination of text size and contrast against the background. I have the Reduce Transparency setting on, and the Focus Style set to High Contrast. As near as I can tell, the accessibility settings pertaining to text size only affect subtitles and/or close captions. The Zoom function is overkill for me.\r\n\r\nThe text is often small despite no apparent lack of screen real estate.\r\n\r\nAn iOS-like \"larger text\" setting that is honored by the home screen, the App Store, and the iTunes stores would be very useful. That would make it a more enjoyable device for me. I imagine it would be of much greater utility to someone who could not easily mitigate these issues by putting glasses on."
