    description: "Summary:\r\nI wanted to request an enhancement to the way Software Updates are installed.  On older versions of OS X, there used to only be one installing updates screen, and I liked how my machine only needed one Installing Software Updates screen and one system restart before all of the updates were ready to go.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select an update that required a restart.\r\n2. Updates would install and the machine would restart.\r\n3. Computer loaded up and was ready to go.\r\n\r\nBut now updates are like this.\r\n1. Select an update that requires a restart.\r\n2. Updates install and the machine restarts.\r\n3. The Mac becomes like Windows and requires another Completing Software Updates screen in order to finish updating.\r\n4. Computer loads up and is ready to go.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI liked how the Mac OS was set apart from Windows in that it didn't require multiple installing update screens, it just had one which handled all of the updating and when the machine restarted it was ready to go again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Mac OS has an Installing Software Updates screen and a Completing Software Updates screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have a feeling that the reason there is now a Completing Software Updates screen is due to some features of OS X requiring a specific type of system access in order to finish updating, but I think it would be nice to try to find some way to make the system have one Update screen rather than two like Windows does.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
