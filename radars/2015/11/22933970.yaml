    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen scrolling inside a file, like a text document, the scroll bar box transparency glitches out.  This glitch also occurs when one scrolls inside a Quick Viewed document that doesn’t even have a scroll bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Quick View a text file.\r\n2. Scroll down in the text file without using the scroll bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the file doesn't have overflowing contents that would require a scroll bar, there should be no transparency changes.  If the file does have overflowing contents requiring a scroll bar, the transparency should only appear if one is hovering over the scroll bar.  OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 has the correct scroll bar behavior.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen scrolling inside a file, like a text document, the scroll bar box transparency glitches out.  This glitch also occurs when one scrolls inside a Quick Viewed document that doesn’t even have a scroll bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis bug occurs on every version of El Capitan regardless of hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
