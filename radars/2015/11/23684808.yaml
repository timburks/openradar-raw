    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the Safari Web View Controller it is possible to open an instance of Safari within your application that loads a URL in Reader View (if available). I would like this ability in regular Safari so my application can redirect a user to a URL in Safari and default to Reader View.\r\n\r\nOne concern is that a URL scheme, whilst beneficial, may not be possible as you wouldn't be able to distinguish between HTTP and HTTPS. One way to fix this would be to a have a different scheme for each. For instance:\r\n\r\nsafari-reader://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/10/05/healthkit-radar-22977320/ (loads non-ssl version)\r\nsafari-reader-secure://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/10/05/healthkit-radar-22977320/ (loads ssl version)\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to use some form of query string:\r\n\r\nhttp://bendodson.com/weblog/2015/10/05/healthkit-radar-22977320/?x-safari-reader=true\r\n\r\nHowever, that would be more open to issues as it would be possible for websites to include this when they want to be opened automatically in reader view when navigating a website which may be undesirable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device"
