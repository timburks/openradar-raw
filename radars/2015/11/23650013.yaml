        Summary:
        I submitted a new build of my Mac app for review. Under “Activity” in iTunes Connect, it shows a yellow warning triangle next to the build number, with the External Testing Status “Missing Beta Entitlement”. Expanding the disclosure triangles for past versions shows the same warning for all prior builds.

        Clicking on the warning triangle brings up a small popup that says “To use TestFlight Beta Testing, this build must contain the correct beta entitlement. For more information, see the FAQ.” Clicking on the FAQ link more or less confirms my belief that TestFlight is still iOS-only.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Submit an app build to the Mac App Store
        2. Associate the build with the version to be released
        3. Submit for review
        4. (in my case, days later) Navigate to the Activity section of iTunes Connect for the app

        Expected Results:
        There is no “External Testing Status” column, since TestFlight (unfortunately) doesn’t support OS X. There are no warnings in the “Build” column, and App Store Status is “Waiting For Review”

        Actual Results:
        There is a warning triangle next to the build number, there is an External Testing Status column, and it reads “Missing Beta Entitlement”
