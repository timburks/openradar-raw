    description: "Providing discoverability titles for UIKeyCommands brings up a UI to describe the available key commands. Some of my screens have quite a lot of keyboard commands, many of which are related. For instance, I have a command for selecting the previous issue and another for selecting the next issue. Because the commands are treated as a single list, these can get lost in a lot of other commands. \n\nWorse still, when the list has a vertical split in the middle, they can get separated on the bottom of the left list and top of the right list. I would always want to show these one above the other.\n\nOn the main page of my app I show a list of accounts and have added commands to select these using command + their number in the list (cmd+1 for the first – because 1 is the first number on the keyboard for what it’s worth). Again it would be nice to have these shown together always.\n\nIt would be nice to provide commands in groups or have some way of tagging them such that related ones are always shown together and perhaps put in separate overlays, to make readability easier."
