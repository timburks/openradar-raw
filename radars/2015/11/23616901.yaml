    description: "Summary:\nSince updating to iOS 9, the audio connection to the Bluetooth car kit won’t reconnect after the car has been turned off and on. This used to work flawlessly in iOS 8. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Listen to audio over the Bluetooth car kit\n2. Turn the motor off, get out of the car for a couple of minutes\n3. Step back into the car and turn the motor on again\n\nExpected Results:\niPhone should reconnect to the car kit and start playing the music over the Bluetooth audio connection again.\n\nActual Results:\nSometimes the Bluetooth connection gets re-established and I can at least control play/pause, even though the audio isn’t playing over Bluetooth. Most of the time the BT device is listed as connected but won’t play anything. I have to manually hit the device entry in the Bluetooth pane, sometimes after turning off and on BT once, to fully reconnect.\n\nRegression:\niOS 7/8 in any version. \n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
