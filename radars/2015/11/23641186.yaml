        Summary:
        I don't know how, I don't know why but my menubar is a bright yellow.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use the computer
        ...
        Let it go to sleep

        Expected Results:
        Use the computer
        ...
        A not bright yellow menubar after coming back from sleep

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        I can't tell exactly why this happened, first the menubar went entirely black. Even when toggling the thing in the General > Appearance (I don't like the black menubar), the black menubar worked fine (black bar, white icons), but if I toggled it back to the normal window bar, the bar remained black and all the icons became black.

        Then I've put the computer to sleep, when opening it the menubar took on a bright yellow color (as you do), and this has been the case ever since. (I've tried restarting the Finder and the Dock, alas no results).
