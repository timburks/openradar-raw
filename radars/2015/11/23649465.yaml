    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Camera app will show the thumbnail of the last image even when the image has been deleted via Image Capture on OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a photo (or 2 or 3).\r\n2. The last photo's thumbnail will be displayed in the lower left.\r\n3. Connect the iPhone to a Mac with OS X.\r\n4. Open Image Capture.\r\n5. Delete the last taken photo (or all) via Image Capture.\r\n6. Open Camera app on iPhone.\r\n7. Thumbnail of last photo taken is still visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCamera app shouldn't continue to display the thumbnail of the last photo taken. Either the new last photo should be displayed, or black if the Camera Roll is empty.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThumbnail of last photo taken, even though it no longer exists in the Camera Roll, remains.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has happened since iOS 7. Cannot confirm with older version.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
