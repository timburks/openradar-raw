        Summary:
        mtm creates a plist without any name whatsoever on / which contains mtmUUID, file is 263 bytes in size and should at least be hidden (and maybe have a name?)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        disable mtm, delete the file, enable via tmutil enablelocal, boom, file is back

        Expected Results:
        a plist containing the mtmUUID is fine but it should be hidden on / and the file should have a name

        Actual Results:
        completely nameless file (ls lists „?“ as name or „“ depending on how you poke it). 263 bytes in size.

        Regression:
        Happened on previous systems, too, in rare circumstances. Checked HFS, also with -Race, but no errors found. So it doesn’t seem to be HFS

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
