    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery day or two, I will find that I can’t type well because the system keeps missing keystrokes. They don’t get queued up and then sent to the screen all at once; they just vanish.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to use my computer for more than two days without rebooting.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeyboard input stays fluid.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKeyboard input gets slow, to the point where I have to reboot. Looking in Activity Monitor, I see cfprefsd (the one owned by root) bouncing between 2-4 and 60-70% CPU every few seconds. When I reboot, cfprefsd is not doing this, and I can type. Thinking they could be related.\r\n\r\nIn this tweet: https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/669627206956511232 David Smith says that it may be related to blued. I’m using Knock to Unlock (knocktounlock.com), which uses Bluetooth to let you unlock your Mac with your iPhone. I restarted Knock to Unlock on both Mac and iPhone, and cfprefsd is now steady at 0% CPU, so maybe that’s related? Including the results of sudo spindump cfprefsd, which as far as I can tell was captured while the problem was occurring.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSpin dump also posted here: http://cl.ly/dvIn"
