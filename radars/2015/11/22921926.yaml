    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen installing new updates, ones that require a restart, the Installing Updates/Completing Installation screens switch from having a sharp looking Apple logo, to having a blurred logo, and the screen changes tones and brightness levels.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Download any update that requires a restart.\r\n1. Restart the machine.\r\n2. During the Installing Software Updates process, the screen will adjust its brightness down and back up before it starts updating; at the same time the screen tone becomes more yellow and the Apple logo becomes blurred like it switched to a lower quality image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Installing Software Updates and the Completing Installation screens should have the same quality and color/brightness setup as the regular startup screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDuring the Installing Software Updates process, the screen will adjust its brightness down and back up before it start updating; at the same time the screen tone becomes more yellow and the Apple logo becomes blurred like it switched to a lower quality image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug seems to be limited to machines that have the gray boot screen with the 3D Apple logo; but it doesn't appear to happen on machines that have the black boot screen with the white 2D Apple logo.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis behavior can be seen, with varying degrees, on various Macs running El Capitan.  The variable that changes the most is the screen tone.  On my MacBook the screen tone yellows quite a bit, but on my iMac, the tone doesn't get adjusted very much.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
