        Summary:
        Command line overrides of build settings aren't applied when running logic tests.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new framework target and unit testing bundle.
        2. In the scheme's test action, define an environment variable that expands to the value of $(CUSTOM_BUILD_SETTING).
        3. Run the tests using xcodebuild, setting CUSTOM_BUILD_SETTING="Hello" on the command line.
        4. Inspect the value of the environment variable while the tests are running.

        Expected Results:
        Expected the value passed on the command line, "Hello".

        Actual Results:
        The value is empty.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        - The environment variable can be set to a static value from the test action, or to the value of an existing build setting. It's values specified on the command line that don't seem to work.
        - The behaviour is as expected when running application tests or UI tests.
