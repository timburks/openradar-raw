    description: "Summary:\nWhen indexing a large array of searchable items in CSSearchableIndex memory usage grows and memory for any particular CSSearchableItemAttributeSet isnâ€™t freed until all indexing is complete.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Run the sample project at https://github.com/prendio2/CoreSpotlightSample/tree/thuumbnailData\n2. Watch the memory usage in Xcode or Instruments\n\nExpected Results:\nAs CSSearchableIndex successfully indexes items the memory used by its CSSearchableItemAttributeSet will be freed. \n\nActual Results:\nAll CSSearchableItemAttributeSets stay in memory until indexing is completely finished.\n\nRegression:\niOS 9.1, on device or simulator\n\nNotes:\nThe thumbnailData is what makes this a critical issue. In the same project I am trying to index a large set of items all with the same artwork but since thumbnailData copies that data memory usage can get extremely high and kill the app on memory constrained devices."
