    description: "Summary:\r\nInside the Finder's Go menu, the Library Icon has been replaced with a folder icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Left-click the Finder's Go menu.\r\n2.  Hold down the alt/option key.\r\n3.  The Library Icon is now a folder icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn OS X Mavericks the Library Icon was a Greek structure rather than a Folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn OS X Yosemite and El Capitan, the Library Icon is a Folder rather than a Greek structure.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI thought the Greek structure was a nice touch for the Library icon.  The Folder seems out of place in the menu since every other option in the list has a special icon.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
