    description: "Apps provide information users want to see. Why not shorten the number of steps it takes for users to see this information through cards on the Spotlight view? There are two ways I can envision a useful implementation of third-party app cards:\r\n\r\n1. Contextually-sensitive information\r\n\r\nI use Fantastical as my calendar app on iOS. Why not allow Fantastical to show a card in the Spotlight view for an upcoming event? The Calendar app already does this. Fantastical could (and should) be able to as well. \r\n\r\nI have also used FlightStats as a flight tracker. Why not allow FlightStats to show a card for an upcoming or current flight?\r\n\r\niOS already offers app suggestions based on nearby iBeacons. Why not offer cards in the Spotlight view with even more information based on these iBeacons? Rather than just suggesting you launch an app, the card could offer you a range of deep-linked actions. For example, you could pull up a rewards card, check out coupons, browse a menu and much more.\r\n\r\nThere are many apps that offer useful information in specific contexts. It makes sense to provide them the ability to serve this information up at the right moment.\r\n\r\n2. Integrating Today widgets\r\n\r\nToday widgets already offer users the ability to see and access trimmed down information and functions from apps. It would make the Spotlight view much more powerful to merge Today view into it. It would still be a location for useful and relevant information, just with additional capabilities in the form of widgets that have been maturing since iOS 8."
