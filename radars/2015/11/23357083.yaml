    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the condition of an event trigger is created using `HMEventTrigger.predicateForEvaluatingTriggerOccurringOnDateWithComponents(...)`, the condition never evaluates to true.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download HMCatalog project, setup HomeKit, create a scene and event trigger\r\n2. Add event to trigger (e.g. door is opened)\r\n3. Add scene to trigger (e.g. turn on all lights)\r\n4. Add a time condition to the event trigger which evaluates for a specific time using `HMEventTrigger.predicateForEvaluatingTriggerOccurringOnDateWithComponents(...)` (e.g. at 8:50)\r\n5. Create the event for the trigger by opening the door at 8:50\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scene, which turns on the lights, is executed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scene is not executed because the condition evaluates to false even though the time is 8:50.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt doesn't matter what properties of the date components are set – year, month, and day to represent a date or weekday – \"on date\" predicates always evaluate to false.\r\n\r\nPredicates created using `HMEvenTrigger.predicateForEvaluatingTriggerOccurringBeforeDateWithComponents()` and `HMEventTrigger.predicateForEvaluatingTriggerOccurringAfterDateWithComponents()` work as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone"
