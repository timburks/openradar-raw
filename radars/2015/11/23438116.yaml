    description: "Summary:\r\nAs per my blog post https://macmule.com/2015/11/06/ad-users-losing-admin-rights-when-off-the-domain/ OS X does not cache group membership for AD accounts when off the network.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Bind a Mac to AD.\r\n2. Set \"Allow Administration By:\" to a security group\r\n3. Login to the Mac when connected to the Domain as a use whom is part of the security group set in 2.\r\n4. Verify that the user is an admin.\r\n5. Disconnect the Mac from the domain, not unbinding.\r\n6. run: dsmemberutil flushcache (not always needed, but speeds up the tests, the cache is not a great place to store this as it is volatile).\r\n7. Login as the account that was an admin at step 4.\r\n8. User will not be an admin\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should be an admin still\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser is not an admin\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.6+, tested on 10.8.5, 10.9.5, 10.10.5"
