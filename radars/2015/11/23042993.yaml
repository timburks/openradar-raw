    description: "Summary:\r\nThe permissions for movie (or TV) purchase and rental should not just filter the ability to get these movies. They should filter the display on the banner at the top of the home page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Settings App\r\n2. General\r\n3. Restrictions\r\n4. Set it to only allow G rated moves (or some other level)\r\n5. Go back to the main screen so you can see movies\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movie posters at the top of the screen should be filtered based on my restrictions settings.\r\nI should NOT see a poster for a rated R movie if that movie is restricted.\r\nI don't want my young kids to see a poster for Cartel Land or Magic Mike.\r\n\r\nI really don't want to have to explain Magic Mike to my 8 year old daughter. This is the kind of thing that will cause parents to return devices/not buy devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get an eye full with no way to turn it restricted movies off without turning off movies completely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.0 (13T5379f)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV Model A1625"
