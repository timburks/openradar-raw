    description: "Summary:\r\nUnplugging and waking from sleep removed half my menubar icons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug in external monitor and close laptop\r\n2. Do some work on external monitor with external keyboard and external mouse\r\n3. Go have lunch\r\n4. Come back to sleeping laptop\r\n5. Try to wake it from sleep with external mouse and external keyboard\r\n6. Try voodoo chants to wake it from sleep\r\n7. Open laptop, external screen now comes to live as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMenubar has all the icons it had before\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMenubar only has two icons an a huge void which was formerly known as the void with all the menubar icons.\r\nExample: https://pile.pjaspers.com/Screen-Shot-2015-11-06-at-13.36.59-kwxcHAyarP.png\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDock is positioned to the right, and external monitor is set up as being the 'right' screen. Closing the laptop again so that the external monitor is the only one fixes the problem again."
