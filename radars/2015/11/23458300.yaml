    description: "Integrate and extend proactive suggestions into the Spotlight view that sits on the left of the home screen. For example, iOS already tracks frequent locations and offers traffic suggestions based on them. Why not offer a Proactive Card in the Spotlight view to surface these suggestions at a contextually relevant time? Time-to-leave notifications from iOS 9 can also be included in such a Proactive Card.\r\n\r\nThis can also include weather information, which iOS already surfaces in the Today view. Why not offer Proactive weather suggestions (“It will rain later today. Grab an umbrella as you head out from home.”) in the Spotlight view?\r\n\r\nProactive cards can also rely on data detectors. Mail in iOS 9 already identifies events and contact information within email. iOS could detect package tracking numbers or flight information and suggest adding a card for them to the Spotlight view."
