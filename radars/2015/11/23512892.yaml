    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the combination (UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateFocused) for setting a UIButton title does not work as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIButton b and send it the following messages:\r\n  b.selected = YES;\r\n  [b setTitle:@\"normal\" forState:UIControlStateNormal];\r\n  [b setTitle:@\"onlyselected\" forState:UIControlStateSelected];\r\n  [b setTitle:@\"selected+focused\" forState:UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateFocused];\r\n\r\n2. Run the app. Button title is \"onlyselected\". Put focus on the button. Title is \"normal\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected title to be \"selected+focused\" when button has focus\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nbutton title is \"onlyselected\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you add [b setTitle:@\"onlyfocused\" forState:UIControlStateFocused]; then the correct \"selected+focused\" title is used; however if you later set selected = NO; it still uses \"selected+focused\" for the title when it should be \"onlyfocused\".\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.1.1 apple tv simulator and apple tv device on tvOS 9.0"
