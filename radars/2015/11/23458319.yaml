    description: "There are many times when I use Spotlight to look up a specific piece of information or perform a calculation. It would be very helpful to be able to pin certain results as cards in the Spotlight view that sits on the left of the home screen.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example: Say you’re planning a trip to a different city. Spotlight lets you look up information like the weather for that city. It would be helpful to be able to pin the weather information for quick reference in the Spotlight view.\r\n\r\nHere’s another example: Say you’re following a game. Spotlight lets you retrieve up-to-date score information as the game progresses. It would be nice to be able to pin a score card to the Spotlight view.\r\n\r\nHere’s a third example: Say you have note that you want to repeatedly reference. It would be useful to be able to search for the note with Spotlight, then pin a shortcut to it in the Spotlight view.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to envision ways pinned results can be helpful for an iOS user, especially if you find yourself repeatedly looking up specific things with Spotlight."
