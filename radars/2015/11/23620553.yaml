    description: "Summary:\r\nIt looks like Preview and derivatives cannot decode correctly high bit depth RLE encoded SGI images. I analyzed the problem and found the solution: it looks like the decoder is reading the value of the run-code as little-endian, while any numeric value should be treated always as big-endian (as mandated by the specifications). The raw copy of the RLE decoding correctly reads values as big-endian.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen one of the images attached ending in \"_rle\", they are image which are not displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOpen one of the images attached ending in \"_dec\", they are how images should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nQuickTime Version 10.3 (727.4)\r\nOSX 10.9.5 (13F1134)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe following conventions are used:\r\n- gray16: 1 component, 16 bits each, Y16\r\n- rgb48: 3 components, 16 bits each, R16G16B16\r\n- rgba64: 4 components, 16 bits each, R16G16B16A16\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'images_sgi-rle.zip' was successfully uploaded."
