        Summary:
        The APP Store APP needs a (category based) browser for all its APPs.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Currently only featured APPs and APPs directly searched are displayed.

        Expected Results:
        Apart from the featured start page and the search, there needs to be a browser - probably guided by APP categories - for all APPs available in the tvOS APP Store APP.

        Actual Results:
        No browser to find all APPs.
