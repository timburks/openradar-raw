        The Activity Monitor can display the host for a URL being handled by an instance of a WebContent process.

        (an instance of /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.WebKit.WebContent.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.WebKit.WebContent)

        For example, right now I can see that PID 35209 is using 0.1% CPU at “http://furbo.org”

        There is, however, no public way to retrieve this same information. And the information can’t be retrieved from Activity Monitor because it doesn’t support AppleScript.

        Notes:

        This information would be useful to app and web developers who are often faced with WebKit processes that get out of hand. Scripts and other automated techniques can be used to put things back in order. When everything is “com.apple.WebKit.WebContent”, it’s much harder to do that.

        Even though it couldn’t be updated after launch, a putenv(“URL=example.org”) before launching a child process would be better than what we have now.

        Extra points if the solution could be something other multi-process browsers (like Chrome) could implement.
