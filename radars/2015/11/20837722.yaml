    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter setting a firmware password, using the Firmware Password Utility inside the Recovery HD, the password prompt hangs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Command+R to boot into Recovery HD.\r\n2. Use Firmware Password Utility to set Firmware Password.\r\n3. Restart computer.\r\n4. Use Command+R to boot into Recovery HD; firmware password prompt hangs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe firmware password prompt should not cause the computer to freeze.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe firmware password prompt causes the entire computer to freeze, no keyboard or mouse input occurs and the computer must be hard shutdown by holding the power button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac Pro Mid 2010 (MacPro5,1) Boot ROM Version MP51.007F.B03\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven't tested OS X Yosemite or OS X El Capitan to see if either of these Operating Systems have this bug.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe firmware password prompt will only work if the Option key is held down.  Trying to use other shortcuts like Shift for Safe Mode or Command+R results in the computer booting normally, or the firmware password prompt freezes respectively.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
