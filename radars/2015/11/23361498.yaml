    description: "Summary:\r\nAll of my devices that are on iOS 9.1 experience the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n* App updates get stuck\r\n* App update screen shows \"download\" icon, or nothing, for apps that are installed (see here: http://bit.ly/1N7RFUO)\r\n* \"Purchased\" area of app store shows nothing, or it shows apps, but again with nothing or the download icon even for apps that are already installed.\r\n* Unable to access Apple ID settings though Settings app or through other means (like the Music app)\r\n* Paid Apple Music customer, but music does not play.  Stalls at beginning of song, after 30 or so seconds, get \"Join Apple Music\" screen\r\n* Radio tab does not load in Apple Music--just white loading screen\r\n* Tapping on links in Mail also doesn't work, for some reason\r\n\r\nThis thread is people with similar issues: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7299239?start=45&tstart=0\r\n\r\nSigning out of the iTunes store, rebooting the phone, and signing back in will sometimes fix things for a few hours.  The problem, once fixed in this way, recurs randomly, sometimes right away, sometimes the next day.\r\n\r\nAgain, this happens on an iPhone 6, an iPad Air, and an iPhone 4S, all of which are tied to my Apple account.  And I have just the one Apple account that I use for iCloud and iTunes.  The username is xxxx.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to support about this many times and they have no idea.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust use an affected iOS device for a while and this stuff starts happening.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple ID-tied software shouldn't periodically break.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does, though.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPad Air, iPhone 4S"
