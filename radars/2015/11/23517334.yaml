    description: "MARKED AS: Duplicate of 15436883 (Open)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSince iOS 7, we can use tintColor in UIView subclass to easily render a view for a certain tint color. It's a huge time saver when reusing images in different application.\r\nTo set the color of an image in a image view, the image need to have the property renderingMode equal to UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysTemplate. Then you set the image to an UIImageView and set the wanted tintColor to the imageView. This work, and paint the image's non-transparent parts according to the UIImageview's tintColor.\r\n\r\nBut this is not working when we use an animated images instead of a single image. (see the three examples in the sample app provide). In this case, the animation is performed correctly but the images use their original color instead of the UIImageView's tintColor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnimated UIImageView with the provided images painted according to the UIImageView's tintColor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAnimated UIImageView with the provided images, but the images use their original color.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'playground.zip' was successfully uploaded."
