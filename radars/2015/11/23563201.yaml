    description: "I manage the MDM system for a multi-grade 1:1 deployment, K-12. Currently we have iPads for grades 7 and up, but are considering lower grades as well.\r\n\r\nWe are having issues where younger students are being prompted to sign up for Apple Music. Please allow us to disable this as part of the MDM Framework for Supervised devices.\r\n\r\nIt might also be a good idea to make Music one of the Accounts that are locked down when we disable 'Allow modifying account settings'. And also the option to Hide the Music app.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\nchris"
