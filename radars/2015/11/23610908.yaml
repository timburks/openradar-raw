    description: "I have a build of my OS X App (Apple-ID ***) ready for submitting for review. Unfortunately, iTunes Connect throws an error message right after truthfully answering the export compliance question with \"no\" and hitting the \"submit\" button. Please see the attached screenshot.\r\nThe problem persists after several tries. Others seem to have the same issue:\r\n- https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/26494\r\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33800116/itunes-connect-submit-for-review-your-app-information-could-not-be-saved-try\r\n\r\nMy app update is time critical. It's very disappointing to fight iTunes Connect almost every time I want to push an app update to the App Store. Please fix iTunes Connect."
