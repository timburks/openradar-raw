        Summary:

        Currently if you attempt to call super in a closure where you are weakly
        capturing self, you cannot. Based on the compiler error this is a known
        issue.

        Steps to reproduce:

        1. Attempt to compile the attached example:
          `swiftc SwiftSuperClosure.swift`

        OR:

        1. Create a class with a function
        2. Create another class that subclasses the original
        3. Override the function in the subclass
        4. Create a closure that weakly captures self
        5. Attempt to call super from the closure

        Expected results:

        Everything compiles and works fine!

        Actual results:

        This compiler error is produced:

        ```
        error: using 'super' in a closure where 'self' is explicitly captured is
        not yet supported
        ```
