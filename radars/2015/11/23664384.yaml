    description: "Summary:\r\nFor builds uploaded to iTunes Connect, we used to be able to update the What's New field and Save that information. This allows us to tell beta testers what to test and what has changed, along with other instructions for our beta.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sign in to iTunes Connect using Safari 9.0.1 on OS X 10.11.1\r\n2. Click on My Apps\r\n3. Click on one of our apps (for instance, STRIP Password Manager)\r\n4. Click on Activity\r\n5. Click on a build\r\n6. Click on Test Information\r\n7. Click in the What to Test text box and start typing, or paste some text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Save button should become enabled after pasting text in to \"What to Test.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Save button never becomes enabled. I can no longer save changes to this field.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0.1 on OS X 10.11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPreviously, if we pasted text in What's New, the Save button would fail to activate as above. However, if we first typed a few characters, and then pasted it would become available. As of a few days ago this work-around also stopped working.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-11-25 at 10.09.36 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
