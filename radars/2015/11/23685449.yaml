    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing SceneKit's SCNRenderer class to render to an offscreen texture results in continual memory increase until the application is terminated due to insufficient memory. Profiling in Instruments using the 'Allocations' or 'Leaks' tool shows a number of AGXA9FamilyCommandBuffer objects are being leaked. This occurs on an iPhone 6s+.\r\n\r\nCommenting out the `renderer.renderAtTime(0, ...` call of the SCNRenderer prevents this issue from occurring, but obviously doesn't render to the offscreen texture.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Checkout sample code from https://github.com/lachlanhurst/SceneKitOffscreenRendering \r\n2. Profile in Instruments using 'Allocations' or 'Leaks' \r\n3. Wait 10-15 seconds\r\n4. Observe increasing number of AGXA9FamilyCommandBuffer objects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMemory use should not continue to grow, number of persistent AGXA9FamilyCommandBuffer objects should not continue to grow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMemory use increases till application is terminated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIs there a workaround? I tried a stack of different things, didn't seem to make a difference.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
