    description: "Summary:\r\nApplications that use in-app purchases have stopped working properly. Appstore says that purchase was successful but content is never delivered.\r\n\r\nWe have OSX apps with thousands of in-app purchases (Toolbox for Pages, Toolbox for Keynote, Toolbox for MSOffie, and others). On 16 on November users started writing that they cannot purchase content on our applications. We did our own research and found that there is a problem with all tested applications (from other developers too), that use non-consumable in-app purchases to sell content.\r\n\r\nHere is a problem from users side:\r\n\t* User clicks purchase, and is asked 2 times, to enter password.\r\n\t* After 10-20 seconds user is asked 2 times, if he wants to buy.\r\n\t* 6 out of 10 times alert is shown that purchase was successful. 4 out of 10 times user gets error that service is temporary unavailable.\r\n\t* Content is never delivered, but user is charged.\r\n\r\nFrom developer side:\r\n\t* One SKPayment is added to queue.\r\n\t* SKPaymentTransactionObserver receives message about 2 different SKPaymentTransaction objects with status SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchasing.\r\n\t* SKPaymentTransactionObserver receives message about one of SKPaymentTransaction failure.\r\n\t\t- With error code 0 \"Unknown error\" if user received error \"service is temporary unavailable‚Äù.\r\n\t\t- With error code 2 \"The payment was canceled by the user\" if user is alerted about successful purchase.\r\n\t* SKPaymentTransactionObserver never receives notification about successful transaction, and no transactions were finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload Toolbox for Pages from Mac Appstore.\r\nPurchase any item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter authentication Appstore presents alert about successful purchase\r\nIn application purchased content is delivered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter authentication and alert about successful purchase, content is never delivered."
