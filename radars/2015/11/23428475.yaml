    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes/Music would benefit from a round of updates to related developer API. \r\n\r\nThe main inconvenience, is that there is no way to retrieve \"album credits\". These could simply be stored in the current database. \r\n\r\nThe basic desired action, would be to be able to get all current references, and/or set any writable fields.\r\n\r\nDirect control from Cocoa application as opposed to using AppleScript/AppleEvents - for *all* related API - is also highly desirable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSince this is a feature request, steps to reproduce is n/a.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS/OS X feature request/enhancement\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease feel free to follow up with any questions.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
