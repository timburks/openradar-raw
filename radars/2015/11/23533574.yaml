    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running a HomeKit application in the WatchOS 2 simulator the HomeKit data is never showing up. I do receive the homeManagerDidUpdateHomes delegate call from HMHomeManager, but the manager.homes property never has any rows in it.  \r\n\r\nIf I run the application on a physical watch, the homes property is populated.\r\n\r\nThe associated iOS application does display the home information correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun a HomeKit application in the WatchOS 2 simulator and put a breakpoint in homeManagerDidUpdateHomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe manager.homes property should be populated with HMHome objects. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nManager.homes is empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2"
