    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen viewing November 1st (daylight saving time end) in the Activity app, the app crashes. The rings show inaccurate data. Achievements that rely on this data (i.e. Move goal streak) are no longer accurate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Activity app.\r\n2. Select November 1st.\r\n3. App crashed before loading accurate data. Move ring does not reflect actual calorie burn for the day.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash. App data should load and move data should continue to count for future achievements.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes in all circumstances when attempting to view data from November 1st. Rebooting phone does not solve the issue.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can very clearly see the bug here because I ran a marathon that day and should have had 4000 calories burned in my move goal. It only shows 562 before crashing. Not sure why it cuts off there.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs under all circumstances following DST time change."
