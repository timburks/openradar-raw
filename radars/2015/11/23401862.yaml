    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile doing the initial setup, the iTunes password is transferred to the AppleTV and the user is asked to save it. Unfortunately, this seems to have little effect on the App Store. Previous purchases can be downloaded fine, but when buying an app, the user is asked to enter the same password manually and can then save it again afterwards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Perform initial setup\r\n2. Buy a new app from the App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt works, the iTunes password was saved earlier, after all.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUser is forced to enter the password manually using the Siri Remote.\r\n\r\nRegression: -\r\nNotes: -"
