    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari's favorites view, we should be able to organise favorites in folders from within the view by dragging them\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Safari\r\n2. Tap on search bar to show the favorites view (the one that displays favorites like Springboard displays icons)\r\n3. Long-press on a favorite to drag it\r\n4. Try to drag it in a folder\r\n5. It doesn't work\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe should be able to drag favorites into folders from that view. Safari 9 on OS X can do it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari ignores the attempt to put the favorite in a folder and moves the folder\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 [13B143]"
