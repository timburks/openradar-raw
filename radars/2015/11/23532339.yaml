    description: "If I have instances of some generic type stored in array of Any and try to upcast this array to more specific type using as? operator and iterate it, it will cause crash at runtime on access to array item, but only on _second_ iteration of loop.\r\n\r\nIf instead I iterate array as array of Any and upcast each individual item inside loop body it works as expected.\r\n\r\nBug is demonstrated in this gist https://gist.github.com/ilyapuchka/28aee3ac5af4133ec93d\r\nand in attached playground"
