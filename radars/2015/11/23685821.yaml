        Summary:

        After a longer period of phone and watch not being in proximity and talking over BT with each other, bringing them into proximity doesn’t reestablish their connection. The only remorse seems to be to reboot the iPhone.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Have an Apple Watch
        2. Put it away from the iPhone for a while (24h should be enough)
        3. Get them back together

        Expected Results:

        BT connection should be reestablished without the user having to do anything

        Actual Results:

        Phone needs to be rebooted

        Regression:

        I have not seen this happen with watchOS 1.

        Notes:

        I’m not sure if this is a watchOS or an iOS issue. It seems like rebooting the watch has no effect, but on the other hand, I’ve not seen the issue in watchOS 1 at all.
