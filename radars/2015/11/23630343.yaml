        Occasionally, Xcode / Interface Builder gets into a state where the inspectors on the right side simply say "No Selection" even though objects are selected in the document. Restarting Xcode, rebooting, and deleting derived data do not fix the problem. In my experience, closing the open XIB file and reopening it fixes the issue, at least until it shows up again.
