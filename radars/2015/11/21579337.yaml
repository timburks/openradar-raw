    description: "Certain flows, for example when the media library changes, are very hard to test if the SKStoreProductViewController is operating in a sandbox environment.  Although I can initiate an iPod library change notification manually, it is very valuable for us to test that everything works properly...even if it means purchasing something for $0.99.  \r\n\r\nIf possible, can this be a build setting that can be turned on / off?\r\n\r\nI am able to test the ipod library change notifications by manually changing the song, but it would be nice to test the end-to-end workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nplease see description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nshould be able to purchase and download items in development mode if I choose to do so\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncannot test certain purchasing flows because I'm unable to complete and download the purchase on a sandbox environment\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was an issue in earlier versions as well.  \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
