    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using reloadRowsAtIndexPaths while the table view is not in the hierarchy, constraints with constants specific to a size class choose the wrong constant value. (If you have a constraint with different constant for Regular-Regular size class and all others, the Regular-Regular constant will NOT be chosen on a Regular-Regular device after this is called)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Call reloadRowsAtIndexPaths while view is not on screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCorrect constraint constants should be used for the screen size\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIncorrect constraint constant is used for the screen size\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1(13B137)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode Version 7.1 (7B91b)\r\n\r\nTried checking trait collection at different points and didn't see an incorrect trait collection being applied.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator & iPhone 6s"
