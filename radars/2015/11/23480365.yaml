    description: While editing text files in Xcode, the files are easily created without a newline at the end of the file. According to POSIX standards, a newline should be at the end of every source file. git complains about there not being a newline. Also, it will make printing source files in the terminal cleaner as it will put the following prompt on the next line as opposed to the end of the output of the file.
