    description: "A large majority of Spotlight’s proactive suggestions are exclusively in the Spotlight view that sits to the left of the first homescreen. The Spotlight view you access by pulling down on your homescreen only shows app suggestions. This is needlessly restricted.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would love to see all proactive suggestions no matter how I invoke the Spotlight view. If Apple instead wants to focus the “pull down” Spotlight view on only one row of suggestions, it should consider expanding that beyond just app suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe “pull down” Spotlight view is the easiest to access, especially if you have multiple homescreens. It would be tremendously helpful to see the top four—heck, even the top one—suggestion for not just an app, but an event, contact, location and so much more. The “pull down” Spotlight view can answer the question, “What’s the top thing that needs my attention now?”"
