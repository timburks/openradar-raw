    description: "Summary:\r\nThe official discussion of UIViewController.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets describes its behavior in the following way:\r\n'allows the view controller to adjust its scroll view insets in response to the screen areas consumed by the status bar, navigation bar, and toolbar or tab bar'\r\n\r\nBut, for example, if you configure a UIViewController's .view with a scroll view subview positioned 'below' the top layout guide, UIKit will apply a top inset to the scroll view, despite the fact that the area which is being inset isn't 'consumed' by any of the given types of views, to begin with.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a documentation bug, at the least, but possibly even as much as an unexpected behavior bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Interface Builder, create a UINavigationController with a UIViewController root view controller.\r\n2. Ensure the navigation bar is enabled (this is default behavior)\r\n3. In the UIViewController, insert a top-level UIView subview which is pinned to the top layout guide and the superview leading and trailing, with some small, arbitrary constant height constraint.\r\n4. In the UIViewController, insert a top-level UITableView which is pinned to the bottom of the previous subview, the superview leading, trailing, and bottom.\r\n5. Ensure the UITableView subview is positioned below the UIView subview in the view hierarchy (since automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets requires this configuration to have any effect - see rdar://23666075)\r\n6. Configure the UIViewController to have the following options enabled:\r\nAdjusts Scroll View Insets (i.e. automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets)\r\nExtend Edges Under Top Bars\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UITableView DOES NOT have any top content inset (since the top area's y-origin is below the top layout guide, and none of it is 'consumed' by the navigation bar)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UITableView DOES exhibit a top content inset\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached sample project is configured in the state described. Notice the empty inset space at the top of the UITableView, which is applied automatically from enabling Adjusts Scroll View Insets (i.e. automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets) and Extend Edges Under Top Bars.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'InsetBugSampleApp.zip' was successfully uploaded."
