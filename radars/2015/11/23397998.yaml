        Summary:
        When trying to set up a device for development, the term “setup” is used as a verb. The correct term is “set up”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an iOS project in Xcode.
        2. Make sure no iOS devices are connected to the compeer.
        3. Under the Destination Picker, choose the top item, which reads “No devices connected to ‘My Mac’…”

        Expected Results:
        Resulting dialog says “Choose a connected device to set up”

        Actual Results:
        Resulting dialog says “Choose a connected device to setup”

        Notes:
        If you connect a device, the subtitle under that device says “This device is set up.”, which is correct.
