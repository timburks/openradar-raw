    description: "Summary:\r\niPhone 6s Plus restoring from iCloud backup missing Messages, HealthKit and other data\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\niPhone 6s Plus was exhibiting strange behavior, as part of troubleshooting I attempted an Erase & Restore from an iCloud backup (made ~5 minutes prior to erasing device).\r\n\r\nRestore freezes on white screen with Apple logo; required power-cycling (aka soft reset, Home and Power buttons) to continue and complete the Restore process.\r\n\r\nUpon Restore, apps and many settings appear as expected (ex: wallpaper, app folders, apps begin installing, etc). However, no content exists in Messages, HealthKit, recent call history -- and possibly more areas.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRestore should bring back all Messages, HealthKit, recent call history data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessages is empty, opens a new message.\r\n\r\nHealthKit is empty, tapping into \"Steps\" and \"All Data Points\" shows \"No Data.\" This is odd, as an iPhone 5s was used since 2013 and Apple Watch since April 2015. Again, no historical data can be seen.\r\n\r\nRecent call history is empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (App Store release)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttempted regression testing via --\r\n* Used 2:34 pm backup from (11/26)\r\n* Used (11/23) backup\r\n* Used (11/20) backup\r\n* Updated to iOS 9.2 public beta 4, used 2:34 pm backup from (11/26)\r\n* Contacted AppleCare telephone support, not able to resolve\r\n\r\nResearching further, I noted this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7258082?start=90&tstart=0 (that's me)\r\n\r\nApple ID: [redacted, personal]\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus (AT&T, though \"unlocked\" via iPhone Upgrade Program)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
