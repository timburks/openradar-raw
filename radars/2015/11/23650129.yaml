    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift literals should be supported in regular code, not just Playgrounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project. It’s a blank iOS single-view application, to which I’ve added a playground called Colors.playground. I then went into the Finder, did Show Package Contents on Colors.playground, and added its Contents.swift directly to the project. In Colors.playground, I’ve defined some color constants by using Xcode 7’s color literals.\r\n2. Open ViewController.swift. Go to line 15:\r\n\r\nview.tintColor = Colors.highlight\r\n\r\n3. Wonder how Colors.highlight is defined, so Command-click on it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe jump to Colors.playground with the definition of “highlight” selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe jump to the separately-embedded Contents.swift file. This would be fine, except that Xcode doesn’t render color literals for this file, so it looks like this:\r\n\r\nimport UIKit\r\n\r\nstruct Colors {\r\n    static let primary = [#Color(colorLiteralRed: 0.8980391025543213, green: 0.2588234841823578, blue: 0.2392156571149826, alpha: 1)#]\r\n    static let highlight = [#Color(colorLiteralRed: 0.1461514979600906, green: 0.5412336587905884, blue: 0.8481889367103577, alpha: 1)#]\r\n    static let secondary = [#Color(colorLiteralRed: 0.2570003867149353, green: 0.2734180986881256, blue: 0.3004217445850372, alpha: 1)#]\r\n}\r\n\r\nXcode should either be smart enough to jump to the playground version, or allow color literals to exist in non-Playground files so that we can use them in our normal Colors.swift files, without having to use a playground.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReference: this tweet: https://twitter.com/aligatr/status/667777925727592448\r\nSample project also posted at http://cl.ly/dtb6"
