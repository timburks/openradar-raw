    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen reaching for the remote in the dark it's very easy to accidentally touch the touch pad and start skipping around in the video stream, when all you wanted to do was adjust volume or see how much remains of the movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start watching a movie on Apple TV.\r\n2. Turn down the lights in the room so it's dark.\r\n3. Set the remote aside, and enjoy the movie.\r\n4. After some time, reach to pick up the remote without taking your eyes off the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movie should keep playing without skipping around.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe movie skips either backwards or forwards since it's near impossible to pick up the remote reliably by feel without tapping the touch pad."
