    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running in split-screen mode, I would expect the UIPasteboardChangedNotification notification to be received when the other application updates the pasteboard contents. This is not the case - even when the user taps in our application to transfer focus, no notification is received.\r\n\r\nWe can programatically check the clipboard contents against a previous known version and detect that it has changed, but there are many scenarios in which this may happen (tap, on-screen keyboard event, physical keyboard cmd+tab shortcut..). It would be cleaner if this notification fired correctly, either instantly when the pasteboard is changed or, if for security reasons, only when our app conceptually regains the user's focus.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an application listening for UIPasteboardChangedNotification\r\n2) Enter split-screen mode with another application (e.g. Safari)\r\n3) Copy new contents to the pasteboard in the other application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIPasteboardChangedNotification notification is received so that new pasteboard contents can be handled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification is received, even when the user taps in the application to conceptually focus it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2"
