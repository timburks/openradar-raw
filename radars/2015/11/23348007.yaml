        Summary:
        The iOS Remote APP should completely support tvOS and mimic as another, sophisticated remote control.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        There is no compatible iOS APP to control tvOS.

        Expected Results:
        An iOS Remote APP should support the user at the AppleTV by offering
        - simulating all swipe/touch gestures (like the Siri Remote does)
        - mimic all additional buttons of the Siri Remote
        - offer direct text input for all the complicated text input modes on tvOS
        - hand over spoken command to Siri on tvOS
        - rearrange the layout of the tvOS APPs on the iOS device
        - launch the tvOS APPs directly from the iOS Remote APP
