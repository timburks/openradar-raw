Apps that only contain the arm64 slice must also have 'arm64' in the list of UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities in Info.plist\r\n\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/25411\r\n\r\nWe discovered that the frameworks, info.plist (not just the app info.plist) now also need the key UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities and the devices supported.\r\n\r\nAfter we manually updated all the info.plist and added the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities to all the pods info.plist in the build settings, rebuild the app and resubmitted our app was accepted.\r\n\r\nMarc\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. build tvOS app with 1 framework.\r\n2. submit app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\njust like a week ago that the apps are accepted and frameworks info.plist don't need to be changed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe go the following error:\r\n\r\nERROR ITMS-90502: \"Invalid Bundle.
