    description: "APPLE'S RESPONSE:  THIS FEEDBACK HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE APPROPRIATE ENGINEERING TEAM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn Mac Laptops, the brightness can be turned down to 0 so that the display is completely off.  On Mac Desktops, example iMac, the brightness level is really low at 0, but it can't be turned off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Press the F1 shortcut X times to turn the brightness down to 0.  Or drag the brightness bar all the way to the left in the Displays System Preference pane.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the brightness level is turned down to 0, the iMac display should be completely off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the brightness level is turned down to 0, the iMac display brightness is really low, but it isn't 0 or off.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac Desktops, example iMac 13,1 & OS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis enhancement would only apply to Mac Desktops; Laptops already have this feature.  I also wanted to request this option for Bootcamp as well.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
