        Summary:

        Give a UILabel that has an NSAttributedString. The NSAttributedString has the following attributes set:

        `
                    NSForegroundColorAttributeName: UIColor.blackColor(),
                    NSFontAttributeName: UIFont(name: "Menlo", size: 14)!,
                    NSBackgroundColorAttributeName: UIColor.whiteColor()
        `

        Calculating the size using `sizeThatFits:` causes a memory footprint of ~1.3 GB but only ~350 MB when used without the `NSBackgroundColorAttributeName`.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Download the attached sample project
        2. Run app on a test device and scroll up and down
        3. Watch memory gauge and wait until app is terminated
        4. Go to `MasterViewController.swift` and comment out Line 19
        5. Run app on a test device and scroll up and down
        6. App should no longer crash

        Expected Results:

        Calculating the labels height with should not result in memory leaks

        Actual Results:

        Calculating the labels height with should results in enormous memory footprint

        Regression:

        Problem is extremely notable when used in a TableView with more than 10 cells
