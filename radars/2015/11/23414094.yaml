    description: "Summary:\r\nThe implementation of -[NSError initWithCoder:] does not call the designated initializer. This is awful because when I subclass NSError I have to duplicate all my initialization logic.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an NSError object using initWithCoder:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe designated initializer is called (initWithDomain:code:userInfo:).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe designated initializer is not called.\r\ninitWithCoder: calls super init (- [NSObject init]).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt took me some time to realize that this was happening. Before that all errors created using NSCoding/NSSecureCoding would mysteriously not work properly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus 64GB T-Mobile\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
