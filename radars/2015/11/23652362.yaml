    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen AirPlaying a movie or a trailer from any app such as iTunes, Google Play Movies, YouTube, etc. the pause button seems too sensitive and sends a play/pause command. The result is the video goes from pause -> play -> pause in about a second after just 1 button click. This issue doesn't happen when playing on the native device. It also doesn't happen on the older AppleTV remotes or by clicking the touch pad of the new AppleTV remote.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. AirPlay some video.\r\n2. Pause it.\r\n3. Press the Play/Pause button on the remote, but keep your finger touching the button at all times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe video should go from paused to playing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video goes from paused to playing back to paused in about a second.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n, tvOS 9.0.1 (13T402)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you quickly tap the Play/Pause button you will avoid this issue. It seems the remote control receiver for AirPlay doesn't handle the new remote as well as the native apps.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppleTV (A1625)"
