    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode does not escape newlines present in labels, e.g. if you have \"paragraph1\\n\\nparagraph2\" as label text to make it two paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThis causes the output to be be modified by POEditor.com which seems to expect such escaping and also escapes the translation output with \\n.\r\n\r\nI am unclear about whether or not the XLIFF format would require slash-escaping for all strings. But in practice it looks like POEditor expects it and this makes it the de facto standard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a label in a storyboard's view controller that has two newlines between text\r\n2. export XLIFF\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n<source>paragraph1\\n\\nparagraph2</source>\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n<source>paragraph1\r\n\r\nparagraph2</source>"
