    description: "Summary:\r\nAs pointed out in the lldb man page, normally lldb will load a project specific .lldbinit file from the current working directory, which is pretty much about project specific configuration: “Third, an .lldbinit file in the current working directory (where lldb is started) will be read.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Xcode lacks this behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place .lldbinit file in project root\r\n2. Start a debugger session in Xcode\r\n3. Notice that commands/aliases etc defined in .lldbinit file are not available\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode loads a .lldbinit file found in the project root.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo file is loaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.1 (7B91B) & OS X 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have created a Xcode plugin that fixes the lack of this functionality: https://github.com/alloy/LLDB-Is-It-Not\r\n\r\nThe important parts are:\r\n\r\n1. Change the working directory in the debugger session to the project root.\r\n2. Load a `.lldbinit` file if it exists."
