    description: "Summary:\r\nThe developer community is broadly encouraged to adopt Auto Layout, yet some new features - like UI Dynamics - don't support these technologies.\r\n\r\nIn order to make UI Dynamics to work with Auto Layout, one needs to implement workaround solutions, like creating a 'DynamicHub' as described in the following approach:\r\nhttps://www.invasivecode.com/weblog/uikit-dynamics-layer-constraint/\r\n\r\nThere should be Auto Layout-compatible APIs as part of the UI Dynamics-related API design.\r\n\r\nSuch APIs will promote more robust apps (no more workarounds) and better adoption of the technologies we're being encouraged to use (Auto Layout).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an app in Auto Layout\r\n2. Try to implement something with UI Dynamics\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAPIs are available to interface with existing Auto Layout constraints\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo APIs are available to interface with existing Auto Layout constraints\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhones and iPads\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
