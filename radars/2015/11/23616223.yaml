    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://21507148\n\nSummary:\r\nConcrete types with generic parameters like 'Array' can be extended using extensions, and in Xcode beta 2 those extensions can be further constrained on their generic parameters. However, trying to declare that such an extension satisfies a protocol results in the error \"Extension of type 'TypeName' with constraints cannot have an inheritance clause\".\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to enhance this feature to allow conditional satisfaction of protocols, which would make the above scenario possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to compile the following code:\r\n\r\nprotocol FooType { }\r\nextension Array : FooType where T : Equatable { }\r\n\r\n2. Note the error produced.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDesired results: code compiles.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(Also currently expected results, since this is a feature request/enhancement): Code does not compile, produces error described in description.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode version 7.0 beta (7A121I), OS X 10.10.3"
