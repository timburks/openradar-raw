        Summary:
        Playing audiobooks at 1.25x in iBooks on iOS takes a terrible drain on battery life, far worse than playing audio in Music.app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Play audiobook in background at 1.25x
        2) Put iOS device display to sleep

        Expected Results:
        Expect battery life to last ~10 hours, as only local audio playback is taking place.

        Actual Results:
        Battery life is really bad.
