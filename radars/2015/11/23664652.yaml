    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen importing an ObjC file containing an NS_ENUM in a project using Swift, initializing a variable with .init(rawValue:) method of the enum, first the result is never nil and second if the rawValue provided is \"invalid\" because not one of the possible values defined in the ObjC file the object still gets created and match any of the case of the Enum when used in a switch clause.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty Swift project (CLI works great)\r\n2. Add an ObjC file containing an NS_ENUM to the project (along with the bridging header to use the enum in your Swift.\r\n3. Init a variable using said enum with a rawValue not specified in the NS_ENUM declaration\r\n4. Get angry because it gets defined and match any case when used in a Swift switch clause\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWork the same way the corresponding Swift enum work.\r\nnil when rawValue is wrong.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVariable gets a value and worst it matches each case of a switch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.1.1 (7B1005)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSwift is awesome. I joined a really simple & clean project showing the issue ;)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ObjcEnumImportBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
