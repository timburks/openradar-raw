        I’ve bought the season pass for The Expanse, Season 1 with iTunes (El Capitan 10.11.1).

        Now I want to watch the Sneak Peek. Still in the iTunes Store. I press “Download” and wait. Then I press play.
        It starts, but stops after 30 seconds. Because I see a preview of 30 seconds for a 3 minute Sneak Peek. Not what one would expect at all.

        I don’t see *any* way to watch the 3 minute trailer I just downloaded in this screen (screen1.png)

        I have to exit the store, go to My TV shows, but how dare I double-click on the Expanse (after first scrolling around to find it) because that starts playing the first episode, not the file that I just downloaded. No, I have to single-click and then find the file I just downloaded. Of course the UI here looks completely different, and the cloud icon that indicates a download is barely visible at all. (screen2.png)

        Now double-clicking that finally starts to play what I wanted to see from the store page all along. After all, the Sneak Peek should help me decide if I want to buy the season or not…
