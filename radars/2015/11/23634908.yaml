    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nBacking up a drive using Restore is very slow. To backup a 13” MacBook Pro’s SSD to a USB 2.0 external drive would take over 40 hours.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Boot the MacBook from USB thumb drive created with createinstallmedia.\r\n2) Run Disk Utility\r\n3) Restore the MacBook’s SSD drive onto a partition of an attached USB drive.\r\n4) Start the restore\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe restore and verify should take a few hours to complete.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAfter over 10 hours, about 20% of the drive had been copied.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe copy using an older version of Disk Utility took a few hours.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee the attached photo showing a restore that had been running overnight. I pulled the plug rather than wait for the copy to finish: the Mac in question is used by my wife for work. Telling her she would not be able to use the machine for a few days was not an option.\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/Restore.jpeg"
