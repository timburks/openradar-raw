        Summary:

        Adding an initializer in a Swift protocol extension, then creating a
        non-final class that conforms to that protocol produces:

        ```
        <unknown>:0: error: initializer requirement 'init(string:)' can only be
        satisfied by a `required` initializer in the definition of non-final
        class 'Bar'
        ```

        Steps to reproduce:

        1. Create a protocol with 2 initializers
        2. Implement only one of the in a class conforming to the protocol
        3. Implement the other in a protocol extension

        OR

        1. Open the attached playground

        Expected results:

        Everything compiles correctly

        Actual results:

        A compiler error is produced:

        ```
        <unknown>:0: error: initializer requirement 'init(string:)' can only be
        satisfied by a `required` initializer in the definition of non-final
        class 'Bar'
        ```

        Notes:

        - Making this class final, fixes the problem
        - There is no compiler error produced for structs conforming to the
          protocol
