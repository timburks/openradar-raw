        Summary:
        Opening more than 1 assistant editor always makes Xcode freeze, as it gets stuck in an infinite layout loop.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open an Xcode project.
        - Select View -> Assistant Editor -> All Editors Stacked Horizontally
        - Open the assistant editor.
        - Tap on the “+” button to open a second editor.

        Expected Results:
        - The 3rd column is displayed and Xcode is usable.

        Actual Results:
        - Xcode is completely unusable, the layout is stuck laying out, changing the width of the last column +- 1px (see attached video).

        Regression:
        I think the first time I saw this was Xcode 7.0.
