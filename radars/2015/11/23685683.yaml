    description: "Summary:\nEvery day I plug in my computer to the USB hub. Every day iTunes offers me to upgrade my test devices. Every day I check the checkmark to not ask me again and press cancel. \n\nThe checkbox is a lie. It does not do anything. iTunes will ask me again tomorrow, like it’s mocking me.\n\nI’d be cool with upgrading the devices but you can’t downgrade them anymore either, and we need to keep older versions around for testing. Not a great experience at all.\n\nI’d just wish iTunes would listen for once."
