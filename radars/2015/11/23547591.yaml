    description: "Summary:\r\nOn Mac OS X, shift+tab is a valuable key combination in many instances: holding shift while pressing tab (with the cursor anywhere in the line) will often outdent the line, and in web pages it will move the focus backwards in form controls (the opposite of pressing tab alone).\r\n\r\nOn iPad Pro, despite the presence of both the shift and tab keys, the key combination shift+tab is ignored, and just the tab action is performed. Shift+tab is a useful command, especially to pro users who are more likely to purchase the iPad Pro, and its addition to iOS  would increase productivity significantly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit a web page with multiple form controls\r\n2. With one control focused, press tab on the software keyboard to move to the next control\r\n3. Now, with the next control focused, hold down shift and press tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe previous form control will now be focused.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe next form control will be focused, as if only tab had been pressed."
