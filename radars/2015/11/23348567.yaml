        Summary:
        There should be an extra toggle under Automatic Downloads (Settings > iTunes & App Stores) for Apple Music. The Music toggle that is currently there only downloads music purchased from the iTunes Store. If I add a song to my library on my Mac, I expect it to be available offline for on the go listening on my iPhone.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Add a song to your library from iTunes on a Mac.
        2) Wait a minute for the iPhone to sync automatically.
        3) Put the iPhone in Airplane mode.
        4) Try to listen to the song you just added.

        Expected Results:
        I should be able to listen to the song without any issues.

        Actual Results:
        I canâ€™t listen to the song as it is not available offline.

        Regression:
        Always occurs.

        Notes:
        I have to go to the Genre view and make them all available offline every time I add a group of songs to my library.
