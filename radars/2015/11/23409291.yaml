    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading builds to TestFlight from Xcode, it might occur that a build shows up, but does not get available for testing. If you click on \"Show all builds\" the build shows as still \"Processing\".\r\n\r\nRight now I have one build processing for 19 hours now, a newer one for 4 hours.\r\n\r\nMy twitter followers tell me that they have the same problem and the might be a workaround by refreshing the page every 15 seconds for a while to jigger it to finish processing eventually. However when I tried to refresh it several times, this did not have an effect for me\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload a TestFlight build \r\n2. Note the time it takes for it to become available for Internal Testing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the build should leave the Processing stage after no more than one hour, preferable within minutes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- some builds take considerably longer than one hour\r\n- they show as Processing even after more than 10 hours\r\n\r\nI am attaching a screenshot that shows prod.ly builds #563 and #564 being stuck in Processing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0.1 (11601.2.7.2), OS X 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMaybe you should run a query on your backend to check which builds are in Processing for longer than a certain time. Most likely you will find that there is a bug in iTunes Connect that causes some builds to get stuck."
