    description: "Summary:\r\nI get emails for certain changes to bugs I have filed. For example when feedback is requested or (I think) when a bug is closed.\r\n\r\nHowever, for example when a bug is marked as a duplicate I do not get a notification by email. Also it feels there are other status transitions that do not results in notification emails.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would prefer if I would receive a notification email for any and all changes to the status of a bug I have filed, or at least an option to enable this. I like to keep an eye on the filed bugs and it's really hard if certain changes happen silently and I just notice them by accident at a later time."
