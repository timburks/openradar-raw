        Summary:

        When restoring, erasing or doing any other type of operation with Disk Utility, there is no estimation of completion.

        These operations can take a long time, so an estimate is very helpful (you can set an alarm on your Apple Watch to check on progress!)

        Also, a numeric value is much easier to track than watching the progress bar. The indicator moves very slowly for a large disk and it can easily take a minute or two to see a single pixel change notifying you that things are progressing.

        Regression:

        In 10.10 and earlier releases of OS X, Disk Utility provided this information.
