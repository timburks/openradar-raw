    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the documentation of UIResponder and UIControl, they say that\r\n````\r\nAction messages. When the user manipulates a control, such as a button or switch, and the target for the action method is nil, the message is sent through a chain of responders starting with the control view.\r\n````\r\nand\r\n````\r\nIf this is nil, the responder chain is searched for an object willing to respond to the action message.\r\n````\r\nIn my understanding, if the UIControl has `nil` target, it will fire its action messages to itself first and then through a responder chain starting from itself, but in iOS, the action message will fired to the first responder even that the current first responder is not in the UIControl responder chain\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Has a root view controller to be a containment controller\r\n2. Has at least 2 view controller in the controller in 1.\r\n3. Add a UIButton in one of the view controllers and add it action with nil target and implement the action method in this view controller\r\n4. Make another view controller be the first responder.\r\n5. Tap the button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe action message is fired starting from UIButton and end up at the first view controller (which also called)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe action message is fired starting from the the second view controller and no action method get called\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS SDK"
