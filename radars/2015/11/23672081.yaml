    description: "Summary:\r\nwhen we build our apps with an enterprise profile and update from one version to another via OTA, we observe that the identifierForVendor suddenly changes. \r\n\r\nThis behaviour was not always there, it started happening this summer and we can't explain why since we didn't change anything on our side.\r\n\r\nWe discussed this with the Apple Developer Support, their advice was to check if we have the \"subtitle\" in our plist file. We do. \r\n\r\nFurther they advised us on filing this bug report.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- add a label which shows the identifierForVendor on the screen\r\n- build a version of an app with enterprise distribution\r\n- install it on your device\r\n- change the version number and build a new version\r\n- install it on your device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe identifierForVendor doesn't change\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe identifierForVendor changes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2 and iPad 4 \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
