    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Apple Developer Relations posts a message, and then I post a response, the messages end up out of order, making it difficult to read the whole radar from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File a radar, such as rdar://22131817 - watchOS 1.0.1: notification text has clipped descenders\r\n2. Wait for Apple Developer Relations to get back to you, asking for clarification or to let you know that the bug has been resolved.\r\n3. Write a response or mark the radar as resolved.\r\n4. View the radar and try to read through the messages in order.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe messages are listed in chronologically from bottom to top, like this:\r\nBottom: My original report.\r\nMiddle: Message from Apple Developer Relations.\r\nTop: Message from me, or note that I closed the radar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe messages are displayed in some other order. In the example I provided in the screenshot, the date stamps look like this from the bottom of the page to the top of the page:\r\nBottom: 04-Aug-2015 09:08 AM\r\nMiddle: 05-Nov-2015 03:48 PM\r\nTop: 05-Nov-2015 01:20 PM\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the most recent message is displayed in the middle, between messages that are chronologically both before and after it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot also uploaded at http://cl.ly/dk7t"
