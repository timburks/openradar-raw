    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Adopting Multitasking Enhancements\" guide states that \"a transition from secondary to primary app is a new scenario in which your app can receive a UIScreenDidConnectNotification notification.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not the case - there is no notification when changing split modes, so applications cannot reliably detect when to display alternate airplay windows.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Connect to an Airplay display\r\n2) Start an application in slide-over mode which listens for the UIScreenDidConnectNotification notification\r\n3) Drag the split divider so the application becomes primary/full screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIScreenDidConnectNotification notification is received\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification is received. Combined with radar 23574610, this makes it impossible to determine whether it is safe to display different content on an Airplay display when adopting split-screen multitasking.\r\n\r\nThe notification IS received if the application is sent to the background and then re-opened.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0, iOS 9.0.1, iOS 9.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2, iOS 9.0. iPad Mini 4, iOS 9.0.1. iPad Mini 4, iOS 9.1. All connected to a 2nd Generation Apple TV."
