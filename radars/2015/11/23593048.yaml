        Summary:
        When using UIKit Dynamics, you can’t add and remove a UICollisionBehavior from a UIDynamicAnimator without losing its list of boundaries.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Build and run the sample project (the simulator is fine)
        2. Tap the Add Collision button
        3. Tap the Remove Collision button
        4. Tap the Add Collision button again

        Expected Results:
        After step 2, the boot moves up above the blue box. After 3, it drops back down. After 4, it moves up again. After 2 and 4, “blue collision” is logged

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens after step 4, snd “nil” is logged
