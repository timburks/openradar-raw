    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen responding to a text or iMessage, if the phone is turned into landscape view, the keyboard will sometimes become unresponsive, and the screen may go completely black, requiring a lock and unlock to restore the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Messages app\r\n2. Rotate the iPhone left or right into landscape.\r\n3. Sometimes the keyboard will become unresponsive or the screen may go completely black.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard should remain responsive and the screen shouldn't black out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard becomes unresponsive or the screen may black out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 and iOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem seems to go away when the Raise to Listen setting is turned off.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the screen blacking out, the phone will sometimes simultaneously record a 0:00 to 0:01 audio message when the audio messages button has not been pressed.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to trigger the bug is blocking the sensor near the top of the iPhone 6 with your hand.  While the sensor is blocked, the keyboard fails to respond, but if you move your hand away from the sensor, the bug doesn't occur.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 16GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
