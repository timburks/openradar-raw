        Summary:
        The current API provides no way to read out the specific order the reminders are ordered within Reminders.app and provides no way to specify a specific order of reminders, while creating them.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a sorted list of reminders with EKEventKit
        2. Open Reminders.app
        3. The reminders are displayed in a different order than they were created

        Expected Results:
        The reminders (within Reminders.app) are listed in the order they were created (the order in which -[EKEventStore saveReminder:commit:error:] was called)

        Actual Results:
        The reminders (within Reminders.app) are listed in a no particular order.

        Regression:
        -
