        Summary:
        Xcode Bots integrations fail (even for template projects) as it can’t find the simulators. Adding/removing the simulators manually doesn’t solve the issue.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        0. Add several simulators through the “Windows > Devices”-Window.
        1. Configure a bot that checks out a template project from a git repo
        2. Run integration on all simulators (including the newly created ones)
        3. The integration will fail at step 5 as it can’t find the destination with the error message “Build Service Error: Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier”

        Expected Results:
        Integration works for all simulators on the server

        Actual Results:
        See step 3

        Regression:
        Occurs since upgrade to Xcode 7.1

        Notes:
        Neither reinstalling Xcode, removing devices from Library/Developer, using the command line, etc solve the problem.
        The only workaround that I have found is that I re-install Xcode, it comes with one 9.1 simulator. If this simu is present, integration works.
