    description: "The -[UIPrintInteractionController presentAnimated:completionHandler:] method does nothing in an app extension, on an iPhone, of course. The completionHandler doesn't get called sometimes. Other times it gets called with the second boolean parameter as NO/false and error equals to nil.\r\n\r\n-[UIPrintInteractionController presentFromRect:inView:animated:completionHandler:] works just fine on an iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached sample project in Xcode (it was created in Xcode 6.4).\r\n\r\nRun the ShareExtension target on the Photos app or such.\r\n\r\nSelect a photo and choose share.\r\n\r\nSelect the ShareExtension extension from the list (enable it if necessary on the More menu).\r\n\r\nYou should be presented with a simple view containing a Close button, an image view displaying the image you selected and a Print button. Press the Print button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn an iPad a popover should be presented over the Print button, containing the print options.\r\n\r\nOn an iPhone a print view controller should be presented modally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn an iPad a popover is presented over the Print button with print options, as expected.\r\n\r\nOn an iPhone nothing happens."
