    description: "Using the on-screen navigation, it is difficult to navigate to the most recent episode of a long-running TV series.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.  Own a season pass for all seasons of Big Bang Theory.\r\n2.  Receive a notification of a new episode on an iOS device.\r\n3.  Navigate to TV Shows (iTunes) -> Purchased -> Big Bang Theory.\r\n4.  Try to start playing the latest episode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that to be very easy. It should either be the default action or an action that I can activate very easily. Failing that, letting me quickly navigate to the season and then the episode number within that season would be reasonable.\r\n\r\nActual Results.\r\nThe default option is to Play Episode 102: a special episode from 2012. To get to the latest episode, I have to scroll vertically past about 140 old episodes.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\nI acknowledge that there is an easier way with Siri, but not everyone will use Siri."
