        Summary:
        If you have an app open in the iPad multitasking interface using “Slide-Over,” and the app updates itself from an enterprise distribution site (in this case, Crashlytics’ offering), the Slide Over interface disappears and the gesture to make it appear is unavailable until the next reboot.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an app in Slide-Over multitasking
        2. Open a prompt in that app to update itself
        3. When the Slide Over interface disappears, attempt to go back to it by swiping in from the right side of the screen.

        Expected Results:
        The gesture works.

        Actual Results:
        You can’t go back to using Slide Over until you reboot the iPad.

        Notes:
        See attached video.
