    description: "Summary:\r\nIn implementing our app's Universal Links infrastructure, we'd like to be able to distinguish whether an inbound link came from Spotlight versus Universal Links - currently both actions result in an NSUserActivity.UserActivityType of \"NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb\".\r\n\r\nThis would be helpful for understanding what paths our learners are using to open the Khan Academy app. (Should we invest more in optimizing Spotlight search results? Or are learners opening links to the app?)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an iOS app that supports Universal Links and App Search (via the \"web + apple-app-site-association\" option)\r\n2. Launch the app from Spotlight\r\n3. Also try launching the app from a Universal Link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSUserActivityType would be different for Spotlight and Universal Links.\r\n\r\nMaybe \"NSUserActivityTypeSpotlightSearch\" and \"NSUserActivityTypeUniversalLink\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth activities result in NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb - making it harder to distinguish which of the two paths our learners are using, and therefore making it harder for us to know how to best improve our learners' experience with links and search.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
