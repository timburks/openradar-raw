        Summary:
        I want to link the documentation for a type to Hinze & Jeuring’s paper Weaving a Web:

        http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=6BA5A34F36ED218B2A928CFA7D22BCCC?doi=10.1.1.19.445&rep=rep1&type=pdf

        However, this URL causes Xcode to fail to display the documentation when option-clicking the type’s name.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In some indexed Xcode project, add a documentation comment to some symbol, like so:

        /// test
        func f() {}

        Option-click the documented symbol and verify that it is showing “Description: …” with the documentation you added.

        3. Add a link which contains an ampersand to the documentation comment using Markdown syntax, either inline or with the footnote link syntax. Here I’m adding it inline:

        /// test [a link](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=6BA5A34F36ED218B2A928CFA7D22BCCC?doi=10.1.1.19.445&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
        func f() {}

        4. Option-click the documented symbol.


        Expected Results:
        I expected the resulting popup to show the function’s type & rendered documentation comments. If it was unable to parse the link, I would further expect it to degrade gracefully, showing as much of the documentation as it was able to render, rather than omitting all of it.


        Actual Results:
        It shows the type only, and completely omits the comments.


        Regression:
        - It’s fine if you remove the ampersands (but that breaks the URL).
        - It’s fine if you use a URL minifier that doesn’t use ampersands (but then you have to trust that the minifier will continue existing & not break your URLs).

        Notes:
        I’ve attached a project which repros the issue.
