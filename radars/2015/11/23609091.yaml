    description: "Summary:\r\nThe OSX updater prompted me to quit Slack and Tweetbot, so they could be updated. After tapping ‘Continue’ both apps updated as normal. However, upon viewing the dock, both apps have the Tweetbot icon. I fully expect this to be resolved after a reboot, but in the meantime it’s confusing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. See prompt for update.\r\n2. Press ‘Update now’\r\n3. See prompt to close apps automatically so they can be updated.\r\n4. Press ‘Continue’\r\n5. Wait for apps to update.\r\n6. View dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth apps have their own respective icons.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth apps (Slack and Tweetbot) have the Tweetbot icon.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA couple of notes; * My install of El Capitan is a fresh install from two days ago. Beyond installing Xcode, nothing significant has happened that requires `sudo`. * My dock is set to hide itself automatically. * Both Tweetbot and Slack are dragged to remain in the Dock, even when closed. * See attached screenshot of both apps with the same icon."
