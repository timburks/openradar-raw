        Summary:

        A task that is started in Disk Utility, cannot be cancelled, nor can the application be quit. You have to wait for the task to complete.

        Or, more likely, pull the plug on the hard drive and risk corruption.

        Regression:

        Disk Utility in OS X 10.10 and earlier had the capability to cancel tasks.
