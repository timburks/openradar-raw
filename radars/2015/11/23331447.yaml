    description: "The App Store sometimes requires my iTunes account password when downloading an app from the App Store. I don't understand why it sometimes requires a password and sometimes does not. The apps I have tried to download are free.\r\n\r\nGiven the difficulty of entering a good (1Password-generated, 32-character) password with the hardware remote, this seems unnecessarily burdensome for free apps. \r\n\r\nThus far, I have just cancelled every time the App Store has asked me to enter my password. It just isn't worth the effort.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Find a free app in the App Store.\r\n2.  Download it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the app to download. If authentication is needed, something as easy as Touch ID would be understandable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to enter a 1Password-generated 32-character password with the hardware remote.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI learned after filing this that, after entering the password for the first time in the App Store I could tell the Apple TV to never ask for it again. I wish the initial setup process with the phone would have the same effect."
