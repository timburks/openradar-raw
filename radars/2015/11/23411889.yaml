    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a new build is uploaded to iTunes Connect, previous builds are unavailable for internal testing. Internal testers should be able to select and install any build from their TestFlight app so that many testing strategies can be accommodated.\r\n\r\nFor instance, some teams may be creating a build per feature branch. A tester may not be able to download the particular build for their feature branch right now because another feature branch build that has been uploaded since will be the only one available.\r\n\r\nFor builds that are only uploaded when code goes into the master/trunk branch, we may want to test previous builds as our actual release candidates if there are some quality issues with later builds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload a build to iTunes Connect (say build #4)\r\n2. Upload another build to iTunes Connect (say build #5)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn internal tester sees both builds (#4 and #5) in their TestFlight app, and can download either on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly build #5 is available to the internal tester.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
