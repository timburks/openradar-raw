    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a HomeKit home is shared with other people, those people have limited privileges, for example they cannot delete accessories. But it would be useful to allow invited people to create triggers for the shared home.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where all lights should be switched off in a home when nobody is inside the home. This could be done by create an action set which turns off all lights. An event trigger executes the action set when a device leaves the home location. To execute the action set only when nobody is inside the home, we use a virtual outlets which reflects the location state of the family members â€“ there is one outlet for every family member which is turned on if the family member enters the home location, and turned off if the member leaves the home location. The event trigger has conditions to check if all virtual outlets are off.\r\n\r\nBecause people can control accessories in a shared home, I don't see any reasons why they cannot create triggers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a home\r\n2. Share the home with other people\r\n3. Other people create a new trigger in the shared home\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInvited people can create triggers in the shared home.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInvited people are not allowed to create a trigger in the shared home.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9"
