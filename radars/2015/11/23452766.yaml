    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to open an URL so that it jumps to the right app (if it has Universal Links set up for the URL), or, if it’s not available, opens the link in SFSafariViewController.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible to do that with just plain Safari (UIApplication.openURL will open the right app OR Safari) — there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be possible with Safari VC"
