        Summary:
        Tapping on the “Details” Button in a Messages Conversation’s Navigation Bar does not show the map for my contact. Their location is found, as evidenced by the detail string under their name (e.g. “Baltimore, MD — 30s ago”), but the Map View shows “Location Not Available”. Checking this contact’s location on an iOS device simultaneously works fine.
