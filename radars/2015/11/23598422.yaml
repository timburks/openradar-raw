    description: "Summary:\r\nExpose DevelopmentTeam setting as a normal build setting and allow for overriding this value through .xcconfig files configured for the project and/or target, the -xcconfig argument to xcodebuild and the XCODE_XCCONFIG_FILE environment variable.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\nAn app with multiple bundle identifiers which each live in different Apple Developer Programs. When DevelopmentTeam is set to the ID of a program, Xcode ignores all profiles from any other programs. This is as expected, but the developer has to manually change the DevelopmentTeam **on each executable target** in order to build and run on a device using a bundle identifier that lives in a different program."
