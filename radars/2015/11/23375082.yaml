        Summary:
        MapKit has a private API that would be great for autocompleting location search results, but it’s unfortunately private. It would be really useful for this to be public.

        MKLocalSearch is unsuitable for autocomplete, as for example, searching for “New Yo” probably won’t return “New York”, and alternative API’s such as Google’s would then require people to use the Google Maps SDK (to comply with licensing restrictions).
