        Summary:
        Itâ€™d be nice to have an emoji that depicts a drum kit.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Make a terrible joke
        2) Say buh-dum-chuh in your head
        3) Type a drum emoji so your conversational partner can laugh at the terrible joke

        Expected Results:
        Such an emoji exists, making my conversation all the more joyous.

        Actual Results:
        I searched in vain, then sent the emoji sans emoji. Some of the humor was thus lost.
