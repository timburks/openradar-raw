    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://22575294\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a view controller is not the status bar view controller, its presented view controllers can not become the status bar view controller. For example, when a popover presented a view controller full screen, the full screen view controller is not used to specify the status bar appearance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open and run the attached sample project, which has three view controllers: Master, Little, and Big. Initially Master is the status bar view controller.\r\n2. Tap anywhere to make Master present Little in a popover.\r\n3. Tap Little to make it present Big full screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe full screen view controller, Big, should specify the status bar appearance, so it should use dark text (UIStatusBarStyleDefault).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMaster is still being used for the status bar appearance, so it uses light text (UIStatusBarStyleLightContent).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, Xcode 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround:\r\n\r\nThe view controller in the popover can set its modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance to YES, then forward its presenting view controllerâ€™s status bar preferences.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVarious iPhone and iPad simulators\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Status bar view controller chain is broken.zip' was successfully uploaded."
