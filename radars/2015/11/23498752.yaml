    description: "Summary:\r\nThis may exist but is not readily apparent from the UI, but given the Apple TV 4th gen's display of all seasons at once without a way to narrow to a given season the need for marking old but unwatched episodes as viewed is crucial.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have multiple seasons, say 4 or 5, of a TV series with many episodes each season (say ~20)\r\n2. Have bonus features or episodes not watched for one reason or another in early seasons considered unwatched by Apple TV\r\n3. Want to watch the latest episode in the latest season easily\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. 'Play' button at top to reflect the latest unwatched episode in a relevant season of the show\r\n2. Alternatively, allow option to sort shows and seasons in reverse order to see newer episodes at front of list\r\n3. Alternatively, allow customers to select a single season of a show again instead of forcing all seasons to be on screen at once\r\n4. Alternatively, allow customers to quickly scroll to end of list without repeated swiping on trackpad\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. 'Play' button at top plays irrelevant special feature or purposefully unwatched episode in long past season\r\n2. Must scroll, manually, repeatedly, to get to end of list then work backwards to most recent unwatched episode"
