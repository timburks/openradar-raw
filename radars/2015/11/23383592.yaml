    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create an NSTextField inside an NSPopover, and have conditional code in the textfield's textShouldEndEditing delegate method, it is possible to dismiss the popover without the textfield resigning first responder. \r\n\r\nIf this happens, the textfield remains first responder even after it, and the popover, have disappeared.  This will cause the App to crash as soon as another event is triggered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an interface that triggers the display of an NSPopver\r\n2. Include an NSTextField inside the NSPopover.\r\n3. Implement the NSTextField's control:textShouldEndEditing: delegate method; within this method, include code that would returns false under some condition.\r\n4. If the control:textShouldEndEditing: returns false, and the NSPopover is dismissed, the NSTextField does not resign first responder.\r\n5. Any subsequent event after the popover has been dismissed, will cause the app to crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the popover is dismiss, all of the controls it contains should resign first responder by default.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.4, \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis error occurs on Yosemite 10.10.4"
