    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an app that securely stores information in the keychain. Regularly when I try to build the app in Xcode and run it on my device I get error: -34018. Problem does not occur when I distribute my app on the app store or using an Enterprise certificate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch app.\r\n2. Attempt to access secure information from keychain straight away.\r\n3. Perform other operations.\r\n4. Attempt to access secure information from keychain after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn both cases I would expect to be able to access the keychain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGenerally the first attempt to access the keychain will work but the second and any subsequent ones will fail.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9.1, 9.0, 8.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSeems to occur a lot more often on iOS9. With iOS 8 the problem seemed intermittent, on iOS9 it's rare that the problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
