    description: "I am currently playing game called Thief.  Thief has lockpicking minigame where you need to move mouse a lot. During this minigame (to my suprise) I've seen big OS X pointer because of new feature introduced in El Capitan \"Shake mouse pointer to locate\".\r\n\r\nThis behavior should not be happening in _full_ _screen_ game!\r\n\r\nI contacted Feral Interactive support. They told me this is known issue. They filled radar which was closed as a duplicate of 21000413.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Buy game Thief from Steam (it will be available on MAS very soon).\r\n2. Play lockpicking minigame and move mouse very quickly while feature \"Shake mouse pointer to locate\" is enabled\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be NO OS X mouse pointer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBig mouse pointer appears every time"
