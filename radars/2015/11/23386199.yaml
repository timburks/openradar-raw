    description: "Summary:\nCreating a bot and running an integration results in error because the simulator takes too long to boot. This happens to all my projects, from new apps under development that target iOS 9 to our library projects that support iOS 7 and up.\nAll projects compile without warnings, run test successfully on various dev machines but the tests never work on the CI machine.\n\nCI Machine:\nMac Mini 2012\nOS X 10.11 (15A284)\nXcode 7.1 (7B91b)\nServer App 5.0.15 (15S4033)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a sample project from Xcode and put under versioning using git and publish it on github\n2. Create a bot from either the dev machine or the CI machine itself using “create bot”\n3. Configure the bot with the defaults\n4. Let it integrate after successful creation (the bug persists if you integrate later). \n\n\n\nExpected Results:\nThe bot checks out the code from the git repository, build the app, runs unit tests and ui tests in the simulator and does not time out.\n\nActual Results:\nThe bot will check out and compile the project successfully, then try to run the unit tests and UI tests. Nothing will happen for 2-5min (it depends on how many simulators you have installed), in case you run it on all simulators, it may take up to 20min. Then, it will time out and abort running tests, finish the integration and generate the log file.\nTapp the lab for “Log” of the integration and find the following message at the very bottom:\n“Test target SampleProjectWithTestsTests encountered an error (Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1. If you believe this error represents a bug, please attach the log file at /Library/Developer/XcodeServer/Integrations/Integration-fcf4712184ca598c3d6bcfb63d0e09d3/Session-2015-11-03_16:23:36-2aLCaT.log)”\n\nRegression:\nSince switching to El Capitan and Xcode 6, we got the time out if we had more than 1 simulator configured for integration, since upgrading to xcode 7.1 it happens literally every time."
