    description: "Summary:\r\nThe currently selected item in the sidebar of most System Preference panes doesn’t show the blue overlay, it shows a transparent gray overlay by default instead.  Examples:  Desktop & Screen Saver [Desktop], Security & Privacy [Privacy], Notifications, Displays [Color] and others.  However, one Preference pane does show the blue overlay (Users & Groups).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System Preference Panes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI wanted to mention this for consistency purposes between all of the System Preference panes.  I would like to see all of the default selected items in the sidebar have the blue overlay.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe currently selected item in the sidebar of most System Preference panes doesn’t show the blue overlay, it shows a transparent gray overlay by default instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Mavericks through OS X El Capitan.  I first noticed this in El Capitan but it's also present in Yosemite and Mavericks.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis inconsistency is present in every version of Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan I've tested.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
