        Summary:
        If you have a B2B app on iTunes Connect, switching it from “Available on the VPP Business Store” to “Available with no discount” or “Available with a volume discount for educational institutions” is a one-way operation and cannot be reversed. This would not be so much of a problem if there was ample warning for a developer that making this change is potentially destructive (i.e., if an app is meant purely for B2B distribution, through a few clicks of a mouse it is ensured that they will have to go through the work of creating a new App ID, a new record in iTunes Connect, new provisioning profiles, go through App Review again, make sure the names of the apps are different, and then permanently live with a unusable app in iTunes Connect forever).

        A warning UI might consist of a simple alert, or it might be more black-and-white, whereby you select which type of app you want to create (B2B or non-B2B) when the app is created in iTunes Connect.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an app with an App ID that exists in the developer center.
        2. Submit a binary to App Review.
        3. Wait until App Review approves the binary.
        4. Log into iTunes Connect.
        5. Go to “My Apps” and navigate to the App that passed App Review.
        6. Go to “App Store” > “Pricing and Availability”.
        7. Notice that all of the options under “Volume Purchase Program” are selectable.
        8. Select “Available with no discount”.
        9. Click “Save”.

        Expected Results:
        There should be a warning to the developer that upon clicking “Save”, this app can no longer be made available on the VPP Business Store.

        Actual Results:
        There is no error and the developer finds out the hard way that “Available on the VPP Business Store” is no longer selectable and this iTunes Connect app record is now hosed.
