    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I upload the attached JPEG (sRGB, generated with Lightroom) using the PC client of iCloud the resulting colors are wrong compared to e.g. Photoshop. If I upload the exact same file using Photos for mac then the colors appear correct.\r\n\r\nOn the PC, if I open the uploaded file (via Open file location to reveal the location on disk) in Photoshop and *assign* Adobe RGB as color space instead of sRGB, the file looks correct again.  So, it seems iCloud for PC converts the JPEG to Adobe RGB, but then assign the JPEG the sRGB color profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload attached JPEG using iCloud for PC\r\n2. Upload attached JPEG using Photos for mac\r\n3. Compare the results\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe colors should of course be identical.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe colors in the file uploaded using the PC version are muted. Skin colors appear grayish, purple has the wrong hue, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWindows 7 + newest version of iCloud software as of 3. Nov 2015\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'srgb_blur.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
