        We are clearly having trouble with Apple emailing beta testers (I’ve got another bug open about that issue).

        In addition to fixing that issue, what we really need is a way where we can get an invite link for an invited beta tester, so that we can send it to them ourselves if all else is failing with Apple reaching them. Right now we’ve got people in limbo where we’ve removed/re-added them several times and for whatever reason, they are not receiving the invite email. But we have no other way to get them into the beta test program, since we can’t access the invite link that Apple is generating.
