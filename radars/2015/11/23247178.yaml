    description: "Summary:\r\nSo the problem manifests when you have a Provisioning Profile created  for Distribution saved to a local computers Xcode / Keychain. If you create a new Distribution Provisioning profile (update the original one) and do not install it, Xcode allows you to build and submit your application with the old outdated provisioning profile.\r\n\r\nThis validates fine from the Organizer App Validator, and even processing on iTunes it also validates.\r\n\r\nThe issue really came to light when after pushing a TestFlight build live, users could not install the app with the Error that the developer's certificate was out of date.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Generate a Distribution Provisioning Profile using the normal means for an app you are going to submit to the AppStore (for testflight or submission).\r\n2. Download this profile and install / use it.\r\n3. Update this Distribution Provisioning Profile and do not install it\r\n4. Archive your app and submit it to the AppStore\r\n5. After Submission send a TestFlight \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would have expected it to fail earlier in the scene: \r\nIn the AppStore submission verification it should check if the distribution certificates are valid and also that they are the latest available. It is likely it is only doing the \"isValid\" check.\r\n\r\nOn a second pass iTunes Connect should check such issues when processing the App.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a TestFlight notification, when you click install, you are given an alert that says the developer certificate is expired, please contact the developer."
