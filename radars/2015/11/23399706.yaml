    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no option to view the generated assembly code from a Swift language file. Objective-C language files do have this option though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFrom any Swift file in Xcode, select the action menu (the menu with 4 little squares next to the Go Back arrow). The final entry is \"Generated Interface\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to see an \"Assembly\" menu pick somewhere there, that's where it is for Objective-C files."
