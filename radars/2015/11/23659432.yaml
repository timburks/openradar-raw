    description: "Summary:\r\nYou can open up a Mail message, and make it bigger by doing Format -> Style -> Bigger, or hitting command +, but if you close it, next time you open it up it's forgotten this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Double click an email message to open it into its own window.\r\n2. Hit command +, or do Format -> Style -> Bigger, to make it more readable. (Font size gets larger.)\r\n3. Close message.\r\n4. Re-open it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail should remember that you've resized this message, and display it at the zoom level it had when you last closed it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail forgets you've applied this change, and opens it up w/ its original size.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 9.1/3096.5 & OS X Version 10.11.1/15B42\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAll versions of Mail up thru Lion or Mountain Lion (correctly) remembered when this setting was applied, and next time you opened that message, it stayed re-sized, if you'd resized it.  All versions of Mail I think Mavericks & later (at least Yosemite & later) have this bug.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll circumstances, all hardware, all versions of OS X from at least 10.10 onward (or was it 10.9 when this bug crept in?).  Happens whether you open message in its own window, or are viewing it in preview pane."
