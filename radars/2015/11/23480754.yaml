    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple TV seems to think it is learning the volume up/down commands from my remote, but when it plays them back, the volume on the sound bar doesn’t change.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Own a Samsung HW-D450 2.1 Channel Audio Bar Home Theater System: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/HW-D450/ZA-search\r\n2. Run through the normal learning process for volume control from the sound bar. Out of the box, the Siri Remote was controlling the volume of my TV over HDMI-CEC, and I leave the TV volume at 0 because I have a sound bar.\r\n4. Apple TV appears to receive the signals from the sound bar remote: the little progress bars fill up, and it never reports an error.\r\n5. Attempt to use the Siri Remote to control the sound bar volume.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen pressing the buttons on the Siri Remote, the sound bar’s onboard LCD indicates that the volume is changing, and the volume level changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen pressing the volume up/down buttons, the Apple TV’s LED flashes, seemingly indicating that the signal is received, but the sound bar’s volume does not change. I’ve tried moving very close to the sound bar, so it does not appear to be a line of sight issue.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Apple TV is brand new, so I don’t believe the battery on the remote is low, but if a full charge fixes the issue I will report back.\r\nAttaching images of the remote and the info sticker from the back of the sound bar, also posted here: http://cl.ly/dlyZ\r\nHere is an Apple discussion thread of other people having issues with Samsung sound bars and remotes: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7314786"
