    description: "Summary:\r\nA label appears under the slider in Settings → Display & Brightness → Text Size when you drag it all the way to the right, and the label first underlaps and then overlaps the table cell that the slider is in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iPhone, go to Settings → Display & Brightness → Text Size\r\n2. Drag the slider all the way to the right (assuming you don’t have larger sizes enabled in Accessibility Settings).\r\n3. Observe that a label appears below the slider, telling you “Larger sizes are available in Accessibility Settings”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis label is nicely positioned below the white cell that contains the slider.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label initially appears when the slider hits the far right slot, and it appears to be positioned too hight and behind the white cell. Then the z-index changes, so it is now overlapping the white cell.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you go back to the root level of Settings.app, then go in to Display & Brightness, you will see a similar overlap glitch on that screen as well. The “Choose a view for iPhone. Zoomed shows larger controls. Standard shows more content.” label is also overlapping the cell above it, the “View       Standard >” cell.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI feel like this is new in 9, but I may just not have noticed it in 8. I don’t have an iOS 8 device to test with.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen recording attached and also uploaded to http://cl.ly/dsl8"
