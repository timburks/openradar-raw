    description: "Summary:\r\nMy window server locked up - had Logic open (idling), Adium (chatting), and Safari (scrolling a facebook page).  Then everything locked up.  The mouse moved, but the rest of the machine was inert.  Nothing graphical updated (like the clock didn't change time)\r\n\r\nThis lock up has happened once or twice before. It's not a regular occurence.\r\n\r\nThanks to a prior bug (rdar://20337717) I have instructions for getting pieces of data.  Maybe some of them will be useful to you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nnone really.  Was happily be-bopping around, scrolling a web page, when things kind of stopped.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTried running  /System/Library/Frameworks/SystemConfiguration.framework/Resources/get-mobility-info  , but after 15 minutes I gave up.  seems to be stuck in /usr/sbin/ioreg -i -l -w 0 .\r\n\r\nRan sysdiagnose.  Here's the terminal output:\r\n\r\n% /usr/bin/sysdiagnose\r\nPassword:\r\nThis tool generates files that allow Apple to investigate issues with your\r\ncomputer and help improve Apple products.
