    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you opt to use a launch image from the asset catalog rather than a launch storyboard, the keyboard that displays is the typical iPad keyboard. The keys render very large and are difficult to type on. The iPad Pro optimized keyboard only displays when the app uses a launch image storyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new single view iPad only app in Xcode\r\n2. Drag a text field into the view controller storyboard\r\n3. Run the app in iPad Pro sim and give the text field focus. Since a launch storyboard is the default in the app template, you will see the iPad Pro optimized keyboard\r\n4. Create a new launch image set in the Assets.xcassets bundle and add the four iPad images--one for each orientation\r\n5. In the General tab for the app target, switch to use asset catalog for the launch image\r\n6. Choose the launch image set you created \r\n7. Clean the project and run in the iPad Pro simulator again. You will observe the traditional/non-Pro-optimized iPad keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard should render the same on iPad Pro regardless of the type of launch image used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe non-optimized keyboard displays when using a launch image from the asset catalog\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro, iPad Pro simulator"
