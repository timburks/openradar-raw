    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen code coverage is enabled in Xcode 7, Xcode outputs all build artifacts to the \"CodeCoverage\" folder instead of their usual location.  This change doesn't seem handled by all components in the build chainâ€”specifically the indexer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clean project & delete derived data folder\r\n2. Enable \"Gather coverage data\" in scheme's testing settings\r\n3. Build project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOutput is in the expected folder (as determined by Xcode & build settings), and both syntax highlighting and autocomplete functionality are preserved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild outputs go into \"CodeCoverage\" folder, breaking syntax highlighting and autocomplete are broken due to \"module not found errors.\" The clang indexer is unable to find modules which have been output to the \"CodeCoverage\" folder instead of the built products directory when included with @import.  #import <> still works.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 7.1.1 (7B1005)\r\nOSX: 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nGather coverage enabled, module included with @import: autocomplete & syntax highlighting are broken, build products output to \"CodeCoverage\"\r\n\r\nGather coverage disabled or module included with #import <>: everything works normally"
