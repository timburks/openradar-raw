    description: "Summary:\r\nSome iPad Pro reviewers have noted that Pencil latency depends a lot on which app you are using. Now that stylus is a first-class input device, UIKit should provide a standard way for apps to have a drawing view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like to see a drawing view that I can init or drag into my storyboard. Maybe set the color and thickness of the lines. The user draws stuff into the view with a finger or stylus, and then some easy way to grab the contents as UIImage or a bunch of points.\r\n\r\nSerious drawing apps that need fancy brushes will still handle the gestures with their own code -- however, it should be trivial to have basic drawing in an app that doesn't focus on drawing. \r\n\r\nUse cases I can think of: apps that need to take signatures (point of sale, document/contract readers), note taking apps, CJK custom keyboards\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
