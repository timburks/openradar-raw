        Summary:
        UITableViewController usually takes care of adjusting the contentInset based on the keyboard state, but it fails to do so if you present/push it while the keyboard is already visible and active in another app in iOS 9 split screen mode.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. start 2 apps in iOS 9 split screen mode
        2. activate the keyboard (docked) in one of the apps
        3. present a UITableViewController in the second app
        4. The contentInset of the tableView isnâ€™t correctly adjusted

        Expected Results:
        The contentInset is adjusted and takes the visible keyboard into account.

        Actual Results:
        UITableViewController fails to realize that the keyboard is already visible when presented.

        Regression:
        Obviously only occurs in iOS 9 split screen mode.
