    description: "Summary:\r\nFor store items that haven't had enough reviews to be aggregated, iTunes provides a rating of \"0\" in the page metadata (specifically, <span style='display: none;' itemprop='ratingValue'> 0 </span>), even if they have existing ratings across all versions (see screenshots). This results in services using iTunes metadata for display (for example, Google) to display a rating of 0/1 stars, despite there not being any ratings or the ratings across all versions being higher than that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Go to (for example) https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=zest+coffee+app, note the rating of 1 star\r\n2) Go to https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zest-order-food-drinks-on/id1040001619?mt=8 - no aggregated rating yet, but an all versions rating of 4.5 stars\r\n3) View the source of the page and Cmd+F for \"ratingValue\" (at time of report on that page, line 389), note that the value provided is 0. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect ether no result to be provided in the metadata, or the aggregate score across all versions to provided\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value provided in the metadata is \"0\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-11-23 at 13.58.23.png', 'Screen Shot 2015-11-23 at 13.58.30.png' and 'Screen Shot 2015-11-23 at 13.59.10.png' were successfully uploaded."
