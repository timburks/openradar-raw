    description: "URGENT and TIME-SENSITIVE\r\n\r\nThe developer use serial numbers for Mac OS X Server 10.6 on connect.apple.com are about to expire.\r\n\r\nThe serial numbers have a listed expiration date of 06-30-2010. The most recent serial number was posted on 06-15-2010 alongside Server 10.6.4 Build 10F569, but it was the same serial number that’s been posted since 10-05-2009.\r\n\r\nThe previous serial number expired on 12-31-2009, so there was plenty of time to update serial numbers after the new one was released on 10-05-2009.\r\n\r\nIt’s now 06-25-2010, and the serial number expires in 4 days. You guys are cutting it kind of close."
