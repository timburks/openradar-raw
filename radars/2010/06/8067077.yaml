    description: "07-Jun-2010 09:19 AM Ryan Coleman:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUsers/Groups added to the 'Only these network users' option in the Preference Pane 'Accounts->Login Options->\"Allow network users to log in at login window\"'are not respected at loginwindow. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConfigure your client to use a third-party Kerberos realm by altering /etc/authorization to replace <string>builtin:authenticate,privileged</string> with <string>builtin:krb5authnoverify,privileged</string> in the system.login.console section of the file. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expected the krb5 plug-in to respect the restrictions placed in the Preference Pane and only allow log-in to the specified network users. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe restrictions are ignored and any network user is allowed login rights. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nRevert /etc/authorization to remove the krb5 plug-in and bind to a stand-alone AD, where the restrictions are respected. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis test was against an AD realm where a third-party Kerberos realm is used, as well as configuring the client for straight LDAP and Kerberos via third-parties."
