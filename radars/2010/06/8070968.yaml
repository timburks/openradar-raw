    description: "Summary:\r\nI have extended the Clang AnalysisConsumer to provide additional rules, to test for things I commonly forget or conformance to house style. It would be good to be able to add these rules to the Build & Analyze step use by Xcode, rather than running scan-build externally with a custom clang binary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. extend the capabilities of the clang analyzer by writing additional Action...() functions for the AnalysisConsumer object.\r\n2. in Xcode, choose \"Build & Analyze\" from the Build menu.\r\n3. look at the build results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmy custom rules can be added to Xcode so I can see the output as analysis issues in the build results window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnothing interesting happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nthis has never worked.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nthe analysis architecture doesn't make this easy. You'd need to provide a mechanism for the AnalysisConsumer to load extra analysis functions from dylibs, which would need to inform the analyser what declaration kind they should be run against."
