    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nThe C++ compiler will compile classes containing methods that differ in return type only but the linker will complain of duplicate symbols.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Create a C++ class with two or methods that differ in return type only (in this case, each accepts an unsigned int and returns a pointer to an instance of a different class (each class is inherited from a common base class).\r\n2. Compile the file\r\n3. Link the project (standard tool, in this example).\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nProject Builder shows no errors or warnings for the source file but the build fails.  Examination of the build log reveals duplicate symbols for the methods in question."
