    description: "Summary: At WWDC, there's always the problem of making sure your badge faces the right way if you want people to see your name. At SXSW, they had the same information printed on both sides of the badge. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Randomly flip the badge. 50% of the time it will show the front with your name and company, and 50% of the time it'll show the back side, which just has a bar code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Whichever side of the badge is visible, I expect to see useful information.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Half the time, the badge shows a barcode instead of name and company.\r\n\r\nRegression: All previous WWDCs have had the same problem.\r\n\r\nNotes: Maybe you don't want people to read your name off your badge. You could always put your badge in a shirt pocket. Or use a fictitious name. Or your Twitter screen name."
