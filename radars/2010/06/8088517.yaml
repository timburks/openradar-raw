    description: "On a WiFi-only iPad, iPad is not able to access Wifi networks that use a fencing page. I witnessed this on two independent hotel networks.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is like this:\r\nWhen choosing the network in WiFi settings, the fencing page appears (correctly).\r\nI type in the credentials and submit the page.\r\nNothing happens. The fencing page stays open and can only be closed manually. The Wifi access doesn't work.\r\n\r\nOn the same networks it was possible to log in with a 10.6.3 Mac, a 3.1.3 iPhone 3G, a 4.0 GM iPhone 3GS and a 3.2 iPad with 3G+WiFi.\r\n\r\nIn one of those hotel networks I was able to click on a link \"Get Limited Free Access\" on the fencing page that didn't require posting any credentials. This link worked and I got (throttled) access. In the next step, by manually opening the login screen of the router in Safari I was able to log in and gain unlimited access."
