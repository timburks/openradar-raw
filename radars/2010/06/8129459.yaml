    description: "Summary: When updating a contact's details, previous details are displayed in the search results field in the SMS app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open a contact with a mobile number or email address. Change a detail (eg. the mobile number). Open the SMS app. Create a new SMS. Type the name of the contact until it appears in the search results list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The new info is displayed (eg. the new mobile number).\r\n\r\nActual Results: The old info is displayed (eg. the previous mobile number). This would obviously cause an SMS/MMS to not deliver correctly if the previous details don't exist.\r\n\r\nRegression: Tested on a 3GS running 4.0 (8A923). Only way to stop this is to \"force quit\" the app by quitting it in the fast app switcher.\r\n\r\nNotes: -"
