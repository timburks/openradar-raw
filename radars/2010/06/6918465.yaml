    description: "Summary: \r\nAttempting to open the documentation window in xcode crashes xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run XCode\r\n2. Click on the \"Help\" menu\r\n3. Start typing in the spotlight search field in the pop-down menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the search to be performed, documentation window to open, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs you type searches start to happen, but within about the time it takes to type 5-9 characters the menu goes away because the application \"helpdatad\" has unexpectedly quit.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n100% producible, and has been since at least 3.1 (and I think earlier, but not sure of version #s). \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is 100% reproducible on my Mac Pro and iMac as well as other developers systems I have used and has been around for a long time. I have sent in numerous crash reports, but as far as I can recall (and find) this is my first bugreporter issue on it.\r\n\r\n2nd part of this bug is fairly critical: once this occurs, you have to quit XCode if you ever want to use any item in the help menu, because after the first crash any time you open the help menu, all you get is the spotlight entry field and a \"Searching\" item. You get long enough to see that those are the only items going to be displayed before helpdatad unexpectedly quits.\r\n\r\nQuitting and re-launching XCode re-enables the menu.\r\n\r\nBasically, the spotlight field has never worked since it was introduced (at least not for me or any of my team members).\r\n\r\nI have attached a crashlog from such an occurrence."
