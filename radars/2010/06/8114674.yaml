    description: "Summary: \r\nKerberos TGTs are automatically destroyed when a network share, which had previously been mounted using the Kerberos TGT, is unmounted in the Finder if ticket was originally generated using Ticket Viewer.app. If ticket was originally generated using the command line, then behavior is absent.\r\n\r\nTo duplicate:\r\n1. Use Ticket Viewer.app to authenticate against a realm and get a TGT.\r\n2. In the Finder, user Connect to Server to mount a share that requires Kerberos authentication. Use the share normally.\r\n3. In the Finder, disconnect from the server. If the behavior is present, if you return to Ticket Viewer, the TGT will be gone.\r\n\r\nIf you use kinit from the command line to authenticate and get a TGT, the ticket remains even after the share has been unmounted.\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nCorrected in 10.7. Fix will _not_ be backported to 10.6"
