    description: Unable to perform dns lookups and connect to these hosts that have a .local tld. My microsoft AD infrastructure is xxx.local. connecting to the cisco asa does not allow me to lookup any host with a .local tld. connecting by ip is fine and connecting to other hosts by name in the network that do not end in .local is fine as well.
