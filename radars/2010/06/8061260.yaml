    description: "Summary:\r\nMy iPhone app (via my Ruby On Rails App with Prawn) sends an email with an attached PDF. This PDF is displayed inline by Mail os Mac OS X with a white background and the same email doesn't have a background for the page. See screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSend an email with an attached PDF generated by Prawn.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe same rendering on both the Mac and the iPad. If it's a bug in Prawn (anticipating) why would it work on the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe PDF doesn't have a background on the iPad, making it unreadable because of the background of the mail itself.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nConsideing it works on the iPhone, GMail, and the Mac, yeah, this is a regression :-)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the meantime, as a work around, I \"painted\" the background of my PDF in white, but it clearly is a creepy workaround."
