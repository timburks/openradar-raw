    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAperture 3.0.3 does not fully remove location metadata from images when the \"Metadata > Remove Locations\" is utilised.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Import a photograph with embedded location metadata to Aperture\r\n2. Choose \"Metadata > Remove Locations\" from the menus and observe that the Metadata panel now displays no location.\r\n3. Export the image as either a master or a version.\r\n4. Inspect the image with a metadata utility or upload it to a web service that checks for EXIF metadata.\r\n5. Observe the metadata still retains location information.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nImages should not contain location information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nImages retain the location they were taken, potentially compromising user privacy. When photo EXIF is examined, location has been scrubbed from the \"Other Properties\" EXIF field, but not the \"Image-Specific Properties\" fields. Web services recognise this location data and publish it accordingly.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis issue was first noticed and reproduced on an iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.0 GM build on a machine running build 10D573 of Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3. I was unable to test this on any other images that receive location metadata through other means.\r\n\r\nThe exported images retain the location metadata regardless of whether masters or versions are exported.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've been able to observe this metadata through EXIF Viewer (Version 2.7.1) on both masters and versions.\r\n\r\nFour photos that were uploaded with stripped metadata still containing locations are viewable at a public forum: **REDACTED** These were made by me and published in the belief that my home address wouldn't be retrievable.\r\n\r\nA web based EXIF reader that can successfully map these photos to their taken location, after Aperture location removal, is available at http://regex.info/exif.cgi\r\n\r\nI've attached an original affected shot, and subsequent exports of a master and a version that you may use to reproduce the issue. Also included is a screenshot of an EXIF reader displaying data that should have been scrubbed in the version.\r\n\r\nExtract of \"Image-Specific Properties\" EXIF Data (from version)\r\n\tLatitude:\tS 37째 xx.02' (Redacted location in openradar report)\r\n\tLongitude:\tE 1xx째 2.99' (Redacted location in openradar report)\r\n\r\nExtract of \"Other Properties\" EXIF Data (from version)\r\n\tSubject Area:\t8XX, 7XX, 3XX, 3XX (Redacted location in openradar report)\r\n\tLatitude Reference:\tS\r\n\tLongitude Reference:\tE\r\n\tGPS Image Direction Ref:\tTrue North\r\n\r\nExtract of \"Image-Specific Properties\" EXIF Data (from version)\r\n\tLatitude:\tS 37째 xx.02' (Redacted location in openradar report)\r\n\tLongitude:\tE 1xx째 2.99' (Redacted location in openradar report)\r\n\r\nExtract of \"Other Properties\" EXIF Data (from version)\r\n\tSubject Area:\t0\r\n\tLatitude Reference:\tS\r\n\tLongitude Reference:\tE\r\n\tGPS Image Direction Ref:\tTrue North"
