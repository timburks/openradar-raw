    description: "Summary: When an iPhone 3GS is attached to an Alpine iDA-X100 (not an iPhone-approved device) OR an Alpine iDA-X305S (an iPhone-approved device), scrolling through the accessory's artist view is unusable. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Connect iPhone 3GS to Alpine In-Car receiver. Click the middle wheel to activate the iPod interface. Select \"Artist\" to have a list of musical artists on the device appear. Attempt to scroll through the list on the head-unit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Each wheel-click advances the list to the next artist. Each wheel click with the wheel pushed down towards the radio scrolls down 10% of the total music collection on the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results: About four or five wheel-clicks advances the list to the next artist. Each wheel click with the wheel pushed down scrolls down an arbitrary amount (generally one screenful + a few entries).\r\n\r\nRegression: This behavior did not occur with iOS 3.*.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI had originally blamed this behavior on my original head unit (the Alpine iDA-X100) being a \"Made for iPod\" but not \"made for iPhone\" device. To that end, I purchased a new head unit. However scrolling through artist or album view was the same speed. This problem does not occur in playlist view, perhaps because i have less playlists and songs on said playlists.\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2470321 has some people complaining of scrolling issues, mostly with Alpine head units however http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=11729013#11729013 mentions the same issue with his stock Jeep interface; bottom of page 4 mentions something about the stock Honda Fit interface."
