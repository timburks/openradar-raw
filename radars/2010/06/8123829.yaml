    description: "One task that is not currently possible using iPhoto with Applescript is to open a photo for editing in an external editor the same way the user can using the \"Edit in External Editor\" command from the UI. \r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to retrieve the path for a photo and open that directly in an editor program, there is one crucial distinction between that and editing through the UI. If the photo in question has not ever been edited previously, then iPhoto will not have already created a copy of the photo in its Modified folder within the iPhoto library, so it will only be possible to directly edit the original copy of the photo. This is in contrast to the UI command, which will automatically make a copy of the photo in the Modified folder, and then send that copy to the external editor rather than directly editing the original copy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there isn't currently any way to determine what program the user has selected as their external editor in iPhoto, so providing a script command would automatically send the photo to the user's preferred editor, rather than the script using some default or having to ask the user to identify an editor separately.\r\n\r\nOne other benefit provide would be that, currently, if you edit a photo from iPhoto's library, it doesn't know to look and update its thumbnail preview of the photo to reflect the changes made to the photo. Using an iPhoto script command, however, would allow iPhoto to mark that photo as being one it needs to watch for changes, just like when the user selects \"Edit in External Editor\" manually."
