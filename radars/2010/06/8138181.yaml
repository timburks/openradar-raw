    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading to Mac OS 10.6.4, we are no longer able to preform ASR restores from http sources from Disk Utility or the asr command in terminal. In both cases an error of \"Restore Failure: Could not find any scan information. The source image needs to be imagescanned before it can be restored.\" is produced, even though the image has been imagescanned and deploys correctly from Mac's running Mac OS 10.6.3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Disk Utility set source to an http hosted imagescanned disk Image and attempt to restore it to a local drive. It will produce an almost immediate error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisk should image from http source.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error of \"Restore Failure: Could not find any scan information. The source image needs to be imagescanned before it can be restored.\" is generated.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue does not occur under previous builds of Mac OS 10.6. The failure only occurs under 10.6.4, and is reproducible on multiple times and will reproduce consistently."
