    description: "When retrieving the list of photos in an album from iPhoto via Applescript, the photo objects are returned in whatever sort order happens to be selected from the View menu in iPhoto (e.g. by date, rating, name, etc.). An example script would look something like:\r\n\r\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\r\n    repeat with aPhoto in photos of album \"foo\"\r\n        -- do something with photo\r\n    end repeat\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nThis means that if a scripter wishes to know what manual ordering the user has arranged the photos in for that album, this can only be accomplished by the user manually selecting the album in iPhoto and changing the sort order from the View menu. I would like for there to be a way to get this ordering using only Applescript.\r\n\r\nA couple possible suggestions on how to implement this:\r\n1. Simply return the photos in the manual sort order, ignoring the setting from the View menu in iPhoto. If the scripter wishes to sort the photos by some other property, they can do so themselves.\r\n2. Add a global flag similar to the \"fixed indexing\" flag available in iTunes. When the flag is off, things would act the same as they do now, but setting the flag to \"true\" would cause iPhoto to return photos in the manual sort order rather than the order selected in the View menu.\r\n3. Add an accessor to the album object to allow the scripter to change the sort order of the album. This would let the scripter perform the equivalent of selecting a new sort order from the View menu, and retrieve the photos in whichever sort order they want."
