    description: "Ducking music is shot when ringer is silent.\r\n\r\nSummary: When the ringer switch is set to silent, the AVAudioSession inconsistently handles ducking, but when the ringer is set to normal, it works correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Play music in iPod app.\r\n2. Set ringer switch to silent.\r\n3. Launch Couch to 5k.\r\n4. First audio cue, \"warmup,\" does not simultaneously use vibration, and does not duck music when it should.\r\n4. Next audio cue, \"run now,\" does use vibration, and it causes the music to duck.\r\n5. After the cue is finished playing, the music level is not restored to original level,\r\n\r\nExpected results: Music should duck when audio cues are played regardless of whether the ringer switch is set to silent or not, and whether the vibrate \"sound\" is played. Also, the music level should be restored after ducking is done.\r\n\r\nActual results: When ringer switch is set to silent, ducking is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nRepeating the above steps with the ringer switch set to normal, the music is ducked and restored normally as expected.\r\n\r\nIn the Music tab of Couch to 5k, pause and restart the music. This causes the music to be played at the full volume. However, voice cues no longer duck the music.\r\n\r\nWhen the music is stuck at the lower, ducked level, turning the ringer switch to normal, and then allowing a voice cue to play restores the music level to normal.\r\n\r\nSystem: \r\niPhone OS 4 GM candidate from WWDC. \r\nCouch to 5k version 1.2.\r\n\r\nNotes: AVAudioSession category is set to AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback. kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryMixWithOthers is set to true. kAudioSessionProperty_OtherMixableAudioShouldDuck is set to 1.\r\n\r\nShared AVAudioSession is set to active before each voice cue, and then set to inactive after each cue is finished playing."
