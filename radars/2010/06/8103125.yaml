    description: "Summary:\r\nMail 4.3 included in the 10.6.4 update either changed or broke something in its applescript support.  When attempting to create a new message and attaching a file via applescript, the act of attaching the file causes the background color of the message to turn black making it unreadable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an applescript script that creates a message and attaches a file, example script attached.\r\n2. Run script\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew email with default formatting and specified text, subject, and file attached.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmail with text & file attached but unreadable due to black background.  File attachment appears to be in a special HTML element that has a close box.  Dragging a file to an email doesn't seem to yield that closable box nor the black background.\r\n\r\nRelated bug: rdar://8086612"
