    description: "Summary:\r\nAn HTML5 local SQL database cannot be created from an extension's global page; attempting to do so causes a \"DOM Exception 18\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Extension Builder and create a new extension.\r\n2) Set Access Level = All.\r\n3) Create global.html with the following content:\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  var db = openDatabase(\"MyLocalDb\", \"1.0\", \"My Local Database\", 65536);\r\n</script>\r\n</head>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n4) Set Global Page File = global.html.\r\n5) Install the extension.\r\n6) Click on \"Inspect Global Page\".  The following error will be listed for global.html:\r\n\r\nSECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA local SQL database should be created, called \"MyLocalDb\".\r\nThis should be visible in the Web Inspector, under Storage, and in Preferences -> Security -> Show Databases.\r\n\r\nNote that the above two UIs assume that a local SQL database is associated with the domain of a web site; if this issue were to be fixed, then the UI might need to show that the local SQL database is tied to an extension, not a site.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo database is created.\r\nThe error message \"SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent\" occurs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem does not occur if the local SQL database is created from an extension's injected script.\r\nThis problem does not occur outside the context of an extension.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2457408"
