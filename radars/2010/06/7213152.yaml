    description: "Summary: Crash reports do not contain the version info from the app (ie, info.plist)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: look at a crash report from an iPhone app\r\n\r\nExpected Results: version # would be included\r\n\r\nActual Results: no version information is included\r\n\r\nRegression:n/a\r\n\r\nNotes: While the UUID can be used to track this information down via the use of several terminal command line tools, it is very slow, difficult to remember, and very error prone.\r\n\r\nHaving the version info from the app plist would be very helpful in diagnosing issues from crash longs."
