    description: "Summary: I use Mercurial/Hg because I prefer the way it works.  It would be nice if XCode could support repositories in that format as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch XCode 4.\r\nAttempt to connect to Mercurial repo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuccess!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFailure.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNope.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSupporting Mercurial would allow me to access repositories on code.google.com as well as BitBucket.  (http://code.google.com/p/touchcode/source/checkout being one of the main ones.)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBlake."
