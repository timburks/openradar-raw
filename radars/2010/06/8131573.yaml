    description: "Summary: Upon losing cellular reception must reboot to get any reception back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Take phone to location where cellular reception is lost, then return to area with strong signal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Signal to return\r\n\r\nActual Results: Signal does not return\r\n\r\nRegression: Killing phone app and restarting does not help, returning to no signal area then back several times does not alleviate the issue, only fixed upon turning off phone and restarting.\r\n\r\nNotes: Has happened 2 times, but difficult to reproduce, very sporadic."
