    description: "Summary:\r\nPackageMaker, when invoked from the command-line or from a shell script, ignores the user/group settings in the pmdoc's contents.xml files, and uses the user/group owners of the files in the source file-system instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new pmdoc document.\r\n2. Add files to the pmdoc.\r\n3. Set the user and group owners of the files in PackageMaker's Contents tab. Example values: root/admin.\r\n4. Use PackageMaker from the command-line to build the package. Example command line: /Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker.app/Contents/MacOS/PackageMaker --no-relocate --doc growlnotify/growlnotify.pmdoc --out 'build/growlnotify'/growlnotify.pkg --version  --id info.growl.growlnotify.pkg -v        \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe built package uses the user and group owners specified in the pmdoc. In the example, the built package's contents are owned by user root, group admin.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe built package uses the user and group owners of the files from the source file system. For example, if user 501, being a regular (non-admin) user, builds the package, the built package's contents will be owned by user 501, group staff.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nBuild the package from the GUI. PackageMaker uses the user/group settings in the pmdoc's contents.xml files when the programmer builds from the GUI; it only ignores them when building from the CLI.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRevision a1371672ef63 of the Growl sources (http://growl.info/hg/growl) exhibits this problem. Build growlnotify from its Xcode project, then cd into the Release subdirectory of the source checkout and run the command line shown above.\r\n\r\n08-Jun-2010 10:48 PM Peter Hosey:\r\nApparently, this does not happen when the group in the pmdoc is wheel instead of admin. A much better workaround, but this is still confusing and inconsistent behavior at the very least."
