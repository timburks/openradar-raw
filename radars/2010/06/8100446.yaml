    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have git set up to invoke 'xed --create --wait --launch' when it needs an editor.\r\n\r\nThis generally works well, but occasionally xed seems to get confused about which text file it is waiting for. I often have other unrelated files open, and sometimes it seems that I have to close some or all of them before xed returns. \r\n\r\nI haven't noticed a particular pattern for when it does/doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
