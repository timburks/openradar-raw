    description: "28-Jun-2010 10:12 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen there are any code or comment sections present, when one tries to set a breakpoint, the editor randomly scrolls to a point in the code. This random scrolling only happens when there is one folded code or comment section *above* where the breakpoint is being set. When there are folded segments below the breakpoint candidate line, the random scrolling does not happen. Also, the folded code or comment segments need to be at least 100 lines or more, for this bug to be reproducible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a rather large code file, at least 200 lines of code.\r\n2. Fold a comment/code section that is at least 100 lines and is near the top of the file.\r\n3. Now try and set a breakpoint in a function near the bottom of the file.\r\n4. Upon setting a breakpoint, the editor jumps, usually up, to a random location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo jumping should happen. The editor's current line should be line that the breakpoint was set upon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe code editor jumps to a random location, usually up, in the file.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is also reproducible in Xcode v3.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
