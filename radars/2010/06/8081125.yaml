    description: "Summary:\r\nThe performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: method is extremely useful but it only supports actions to be taken in the future, not in the past. This arbitrary limitation should be removed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: with a negative delay.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selector should be performed in the past.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is actually performed at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNegative delays have never been supported by this API.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDue to compatibility concerns with existing code that depends on the current behavior of negative delays happening in the future, it may be desirable to add a new method with support for negative delay performs rather than altering the semantics of the existing one."
