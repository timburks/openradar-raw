    description: "Xcode 3.2.1 still does not properly search the keychain search path when checking dependencies to see if the specified identity is valid.  It also does not list any certificates outside of the login.keychain.  This is contrary to documentation and to the codesign utility itself which both mention they will search the keychain search path to find the identity unless a keychain is specified.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for Code Signing Identity in Xcode build settings:\r\n\r\nThe name (“common name”) of a valid code-signing certificate in a keychain within your keychain path.   A missing or invalid certificate will cause a build error.  [CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY]\r\n\r\nA possible nice feature to have to help this problem is the ability to choose a keychain to explicitly use for signing.  You can manually specify one with Other Code Signing Flags but this doesn't help get past the Xcode dep check, but would help with similar named certs across multiple keychains."
