    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to 10.6.4, a very unhelpful message came up from IncompatibleAppDisplay.app (in the private SystemMigration.framework) that was next to useless.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. From a pre-10.6.4 system, Have something installed on your system that will trigger the IncompatibleAppDisplay.app\r\n2. Upgrade to 10.6.4\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf there is something known to be incompatible, please identify *what* the thing is, and also, what exactly happened to the binary -- it should not be deleted!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA strange window opened up (see attached screenshot) with a link to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3258 ... First of all, the dialog was extremely non-standard UI, with selectable text that made it hard to click on the hyperlink.\r\n\r\nBut even worse, I couldn't identify *any* item on the list on this web page that I had installed on my system, so there was no clue as to what software was found to be incompatible.\r\n\r\nI classified this bug as \"Data Loss\" because I don't want items being removed by Mac OS X without my consent.  \r\n\r\nReally, this compatibility check should *list* exactly what was incompatible, and show me!  Don't make me guess and hunt around.  And if something is disabled, how about moving it to a separate folder that makes it very clear that they were moved aside and why.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nATTACHMENT:  SEE http://twitpic.com/1xft7p"
