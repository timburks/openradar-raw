    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSome pages don't display the vertical scrollbar, even when directed or required by page content.  Closing and reopening Safari fixes this, but is not a desirable solution.  Another workaround is to set Preferences > General > New Tabs open with > Same Page.  This is not entirely obvious, and is a kludge.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Find a page that should display a vertical scroll bar and go there. \r\n2. Notice the lack of a vertical scroll bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected a vertical scroll bar as dictated by the content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe page did not display a vertical scroll bar.  One cannot scroll the page using arrow keys, page up/down, mouse wheel, or trackpad scrolling, either; selecting the page content and moving the mouse below the content and above the content will scroll the page.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI have no further data, but looking around the web suggests that this issue has also occurred in older versions of Safari.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is always reproducible when it happens on a given page, but finding WHAT causes it to happen seems tricky.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to this latest support discussion: http://discussions.info.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11646502\r\n\r\nThey discuss the two workarounds I listed in the summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nupdated 20100627:\r\nAlso, this seems to happen in things that use Safari (WebKit) for web views, like the Dictionary.app.  I also have issues with Dictionary not correctly displaying the vertical scrollbar after updating Safari.\r\n\r\nexample: (note that resizing the window DOES sometimes display a scrollbar, but not allowing full scrolling of the view)\r\nhttp://www.hostanypic.com/out.php/i11361_screen-shot-2010-06-27-at-12.06.36.png\r\nhttp://www.hostanypic.com/out.php/i11362_screen-shot-2010-06-27-at-12.06.46.png\r\nhttp://www.hostanypic.com/out.php/i11363_screen-shot-2010-06-27-at-12.06.50.png\r\nhttp://www.hostanypic.com/out.php/i11365_screen-shot-2010-06-27-at-12.06.56.png"
