    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Mac OS X 10.6.3 source release at http://opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-1063/ includes the dyld project at version 132.13, but it cannot be built due to a missing dependency on libunwind, the sources for which do not appear to be available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fetch http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/dyld/dyld-132.13.tar.gz.\r\n2. Try to build it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to build dyld as distributed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDue to missing headers from libunwind, dyld cannot be built as is.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\ndyld as of 10.5.8[1] did not require libunwind and hence built as expected. This is no longer the behaviour as of 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n[1]: http://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-97.1/"
