    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen PEAP-MS-CHAP v2 is in use in an organisation to authenticate wired or wireless users via 802.1X, a user will often get their first attempt at supplying their username and password wrong. They are not reprompted to try again when this happens.\r\n\r\nDebugging shows that the ID of the MS-CHAP v2 response is not incremented for the retry which causes it to fail. This behaviour is in violation of the RFC. When Microsoft's NPS is used as the backing RADIUS service, an internal error is logged on the server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to authenticate against an authenticator (switch or WAP) which is backed by Microsoft's NPS RADIUS server via PEAP-MS-CHAPv2. Get the initial username and password combination wrong, the user will be notified that 802.1X authentication has failed and will not be reprompted to try again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should be prompted to re-enter their username and password after a bad combination has been supplied, up to the limit configured on the RADIUS server.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a bad username and password combination has been provided, Mac OS X prompts that 802.1X authentication has failed.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's NPS Server logs than an internal error has occurred. When RAS tracing is enabled, the following is logged:\r\n\r\n\"[2440] 06-18 10:20:01:968: Got ID 10 when expecting 11\r\n[2440] 06-18 10:20:01:968: Received packet is invalid. So silently discarding it\"\r\n\r\nThis shows that the ID in the inner MS-CHAP v2 EAP method has not been incremented.\r\n\r\nRegression: I do not know if this has ever worked. It does not in the latest releases of 10.5 and 10.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis also affects iOS devices, such as the iPhone and iPad."
