    description: "When dealing with creating custom views there is a constant frustration that gets me. Quite often I don't need to load anything from an archive when the view loads. As such my initWithFrame: and initWithCoder: methods are nearly identical. I often abstract these out into a separate method that is then called from the two initialisers.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I'm having to declare both of these initialisers just to get them to call the same code. What would be better is if there was a default -(void)setup method, which would be called in the default implementations of initWithFrame: and initWithCoder:. I could then override this method in my subclass and all would be fine. And if I did need to deal with archives I can just implement initWithCoder: and not initWithFrame:\r\n\r\nObviously this isn't the only place in Cocoa that may have this problem but it is where the problem rears its head the most often"
