    description: "Summary: \r\nWord jump and selection with regards to filenames and keypaths don't behave like they used to.  You used to be able to select just the filename and not the extension and also select a single key in a keypath.  You no longer can in most parts of the UI in both Xcode and Interface Builder\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Rename a file in Xcode, \r\n2. double-click name or option-arrow left & right\r\n\r\nor \r\n1. Create a new file in a project\r\n2. Try option-arrowing or double-clicking the file name field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect these situations to consider the period to be a word stop, preventing selection of the full filename or full keypath.  Or in option-arrow case, preventing cursor from jumping the complete string instead of just the word.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead double-clicking and option-arrow movement jump past periods in these situations unlike their old behavior in 3.1.x developer tools.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is inconsistent with other areas of the OS like finder which deals with filenames and properly jumps & selects around periods in extensions.  I believe system wide it used to consider periods to not be part of a word regardless of what application & context.  This is wrong though at least in the developer tools context since the period is often used to separate words like in keypaths."
