    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen switching the iPad's Mail.app view from Trash to Inbox in portrait the view behind doesn't change and still says \"Trash\" on the top left popover. Deleting all of the mail in the Trash and switching to Inbox still shows the last message viewed even if it is deleted.\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an Inbox with Mail in it. Make sure that you are in portrait mode.\r\n2. Delete all of the messages in the Inbox at one time.\r\n3. Go to Trash while still in portrait mode.\r\n4. Delete all of the messages while in portrait mode.\r\n5. Go to Inbox while in portrait mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIPopover button should say Inbox. There should be no email message loaded in the portrait view.\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIPopover button says Trash and shows the last viewed message even if it has been deleted.\r\nRegression:\r\nIt does not occur if the view is switched between landscape and portrait and you go from Trash to Inbox.\r\nNotes:\r\nPretty much the bug occurs when using only portrait mode for managing your email.\r\n\r\n27-Jun-2010 12:17 AM Anthony Glyadchenko:\r\nIn the first step, make sure that you have viewed the contents of at least one email before going to step 2.\r\n\r\n28-Jun-2010 06:26 PM Anthony Glyadchenko:\r\n'IMG_0018.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n28-Jun-2010 06:27 PM Anthony Glyadchenko:\r\n'IMG_0016-1.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n28-Jun-2010 06:28 PM Anthony Glyadchenko:\r\n'IMG_0017-1.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n28-Jun-2010 06:32 PM Anthony Glyadchenko:\r\n'Device Log.txt' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n28-Jun-2010 10:35 AM Patrick Collins :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nCould you please take a screenshot of this issue and attach it to this report.\r\n\r\nAlso, could you please attach your device log to the bug report. Device logs can be retrieved via the Organizer in Xcode. Or, from the iPhone Configuration Utility:\r\n\r\n1. Download and install iPCU from http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/\r\n2. Launch iPCU, then connect device with USB cable\r\n3. Click the Console tab in iPCU\r\n4. Reproduce the problem\r\n5. Click the “Save as” button to save the log to a text file.\r\n6. Attach the text file to the bug report"
