    description: "Related to OpenRadar rdar://7045231\r\n\r\nSummary: XCode always uses the \"default keychain\" when performing or validating code signing. This is a major issue that thousands of developers have posted inquiries and work arounds for. Even if you have a single developer account, it is extremely helpful to keep your code signing certs in a separate keychain, as this makes it much easier to move to a new machine, update to a new version of OS X (which is a good time to do a clean install and not migrate so that any bad prefs, etc. are not carried over).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Setup signing of an iOS (or Mac OS X) application\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Should be able to use any keychain available, just like all other OS X programs do\r\n\r\nActual Results: Can only use \"default\" keychain. Currently one must run the keychain utility app, manually make the correct keychain the default, do your building/testing/etc and remember to go back to the keychain app and manually set the default back to login (or whatever your default happens to be).\r\n\r\nA large issue with this setup is that some programs, such as iChat, will automatically create new entries in your \"default\" keychain if an existing one is not found. As such, the developer always needs to manually scan their code signing keychains to make see if any extra entries were added, and if so manually remove them (or move them to the appropriate keychain, depends on what they are ... yet another item that requires unnecessary thought/time).\r\n\r\nRegression: This occurs in XCode 3.1 - 3.2 and happens for any project which uses the keychain.\r\n\r\nNotes: The current behavior is actually a slight improvement on the original behavior of searching all keychains, because XCode was not able to correctly identify the keychain to use in that case. I think that even if XCode could be made to detect the correct keychain to use in most cases, it would still be needed to allow setting of a specific keychain in project settings. I might have, for instance, several signing certificates that start from the same private key but are somehow setup uniquely (ie, to allow push notifications, etc) in different keychains."
