    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you connect to a wireless network with a Client ID configured for this network, it doesn't honor this setting while requesting an IP address.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure a DHCP server to reserve an IP address for a Client ID, configure the iOS device and connect to the wireless network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iOS device gets the reserved IP address assigned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iOS device gets a normal DHCP leased IP address assigned.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm using an AirPort Extreme (Simultaneous Dual-Band) with firmnware version 7.4.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen you reserve an IP address based on the MAC address of the iOS device, it works fine."
