    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA call to - [UIScrollView setContentOffset:] ends up at the wrong offset if called while the receiver is performing an animated scroll from a previous call to - [UIScrollView setContentOffset:animated:].  This bug may also affect other forms of setting the content offset as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In a scrollable UIScrollView, call [scrollView setContentOffset:offset1 animated:Yes];\r\n2. Before that animation is done, call scrollView.contentOffset = offset2; where offset1 is different from offset2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the scroll view would end up with content offset exactly at offset2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe content offset actually ends up at offset1.  If step 2 (setting the content offset without animation) is done after a brief time delay, the actual content offset can be neither offset1 nor offset2.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this consistently in iPhone OS 3.2 (final), xcode 3.2.2, using OS X 10.6.3.  I usually run this in the iPhone Simulator, although I believe the same behavior is present on the iPad device as well - 3G, 16G hardware.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nMy notes on it are also available here:\r\nhttp://bynomial.com/blog/?p=69"
