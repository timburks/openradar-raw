    description: "25-May-2010 04:59 PM Steve Weller:\r\nSummary:\r\nA superclass's ivar becomes inaccessible if a property is declared in a subclass that references an ivar that does not exist. The result is an extraneous Variable Not Found. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Fix build options so that there is Codesign error\r\n1. Compile enclosed simple project. \"delegate\" is not found when referenced in ClassC, when it obviously exists in ClassA, its super super class.\r\n2. Comment out the two references to \"interloper\" in ClassC.m on lines 12 and 17\r\n3. Compile again and there is no error\r\n4. Switch between compilation for device and simulator to see difference in warnings\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompiler always warns if property references an non-existent ivar\r\nCompiler does not give extraneous errors because it has forgotten an ivar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompiler behavior is different between device and simulator\r\nSimulator behavior is confusing because the cause of the bug has no relation to the symptom\r\nCompiler incorrectly fails to compile the code\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe behavior is different if compiling for the simulator in that the simulator warns about the property with a missing ivar, whereas compiling for the device, there is no warning.\r\n\r\n64-bit\r\nComponent versions\r\nXcode IDE: 1650.0\r\nXcode Core: 1648.0\r\nToolSupport: 1631.0"
