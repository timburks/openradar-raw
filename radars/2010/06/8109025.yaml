    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPlease added support for LLVM to iOS, to support dynamic code generation of performance critical routines.\r\n\r\nAn example would be a sound effects processor or synthesizer builder, where individual sound modules / components could be arbitrarily connected.  By supporting LLVM, we could dynamically generate the synthesizer, which would run extremely efficiently."
