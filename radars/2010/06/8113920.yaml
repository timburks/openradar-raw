    description: "Summary:\r\nCompared with iPhone OS 3.1.3 on my iPhone 3G, the iOS 4.0 GM seed software feels slow/sluggish.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall 4.0 GM seed on an iPhone 3G.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLittle bit slower/sluggish performance on the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMuch slower/sluggish performance on the device.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems that there is little free RAM. Directly after start-up there is about 2-7MB free (wired=25MB, active=28MB, inactive=16MB, free=7MB. After about 5 minutes there is about 3-4MB free (wired=24MB, active=28MB, inactive=16MB, free=3MB).\r\n\r\nTo measure the RAM usage I'm using the iStat app, to launch the app I've used a Spotlight search. In this progress I've unlocked the SIM and connected to my wireless network before starting the iStat app."
