    description: "Duplicate of radr://7895926\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nXCode hangs when rebuilding a project after cleaning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen project which has sub-projects (ie, a project to build an included framework or library). Build project. Once build completes, do a clean all on project, then delete the build folder and finally attempt to build the project again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXCode should build the project\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXCode locks up (no disk access, cpu usage, etc). Must force quit.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIs 100% reproducible for me for any project with sub-projects. If I skip the 'delete build folder' step it's about 90% reproducible. Projects without sub-projects are about 20% more likely to build (wild estimate).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHave sent several crash logs on the issue, one attached."
