    description: "30-Jun-2010 12:56 PM Jesse Pearson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to utilise navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() or watchPosition(), the error callback (if one is present) is always executed with a PositionError code 1 with a message of \"User denied Geolocation\"\r\n\r\nThis could be handy for a number of extensions, though I can't envision what the UI regarding geolocation permission might look like. Perhaps something akin to iOS 4's? I, for one, was going to use it to allow a user to specify position tracking such that whenever their zip code changes, they receive relevant weather items for their current zip.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn some injected script, or in global HTML:\r\n\r\nnavigator.geolocation.watchPosition(function(p) {\r\n   console.log(\"Latitude: \" + p.coords.latitude;\r\n   console.log(\"Longitude: \" + p.coords.longitude;\r\n}, function(e) {\r\n   console.log(\"An error occurred tracking/getting position.\");\r\n   console.log(e);\r\n});\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA confirmation dialog, such as is the presented case with external website access to navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition(); and the success callback to be called. And some settings UI to manage extension & website access to geolocation information akin to iOS 4's.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nError callback always called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
