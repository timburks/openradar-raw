    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen zoomed in with Screen Zoom on a multiple-display setup, panning doesn't operate correctly. Instead of panning when the pointer reaches the edge of any screen, it pans when the pointer reaches the edge of the imaginary rectangle that circumscribes ALL screens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect  a secondary display. In Display preferences, arrange the displays so that the secondary is to one side of the primary and a different height, with the tops aligned. (In my case, the secondary display is taller; see enclosed screenshot.)\r\n2. Open Mouse preferences and turn on Screen Zoom.\r\n3. Click Options and select \"Only when the pointer reaches an edge.\"\r\n4. Zoom the screen so that there is room to pan down on the shorter of the two displays.\r\n5. Move the mouse to the bottom edge of the shorter display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe displays pan down to follow the pointer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. The offscreen region is inaccessible while the pointer is on the shorter display; to pan down, one must first move the pointer to the taller display.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think this was working properly in 10.6.3, and the bug first appeared in 10.6.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy hardware is an i7 iMac with a Samsung 204B display attached via a DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter. A screenshot of the Arrangement tab from my Display preference pane is attached."
