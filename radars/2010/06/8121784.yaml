    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ability to set artwork and song information for the lock screen for background audio class applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch an app such as Pandora and start listening to some music. Put the app in the background, and then lock your device. Double tap the home button to bring up the lock screen controls.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'm expecting to see the normal play, next track, and previous track controls, but also song information (including title, artist, and album), as well as full cover art, if available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see the normal audio controls, but that's it. If I want to go see more information about the song, I need to unlock my device and launch Pandora again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone, enhancement request."
