    description: "08-Jun-2010 09:00 PM Randall Luecke:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is no API to access the camera roll from within the browser. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo be able to select photos/videos from the camera roll, or be able to take a picture directly from a browser application\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't. :(\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nNo\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSomething a little more powerful than just a file upload button would be nice. It would pretty easy to add a form with an invisible input element that had the file attribute. I'd really like to be able to bring up the picker on demand though through a basic API."
