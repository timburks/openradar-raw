    description: "Summary:\r\nWith 10.6 removing the old CMPlugin APIs, there's now only Services to general menu options when right-clicking.  The downside is services requires hard-coded available services in Info.plist.  With CMPlugins you had the ability to adjust the menu based on outside sources like User's preferences in your application.  This would be beneficial for certain useful contextual menu using products."
