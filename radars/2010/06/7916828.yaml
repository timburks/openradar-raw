    description: "28-Apr-2010 06:48 AM Lane Roathe:\r\nStarting with XCode 3.2.2 (and also happening with the beta of 3.2.3) I get messages stating \"Re-enabling shared library breakpoint #\" flooding the GDB console whenever I debug an application which includes frameworks that I also build.\r\n\r\nThe actual issue is that the debugger never breaks at any of the breakpoints listed in any of my frameworks. The only work around I have found that works is to start debugging the app, then switch back to XCode, navigate to the source file which has the breakpoint I want to work, remove the break point and then re-add it. This must be done every single time the framework is rebuilt (which is almost always, since that's why we want the breakpoint)."
