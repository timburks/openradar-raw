    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes user-editable episode number metadata for TV series not respected by iPad for sorting purposes\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have video files that I have told iTunes are TV series, with season and episodes numbers and titles all added via iTunes' Get Info window. On the Options tab, Media Kind: TV Show is selected, and on the Video tab, appropriate information is entered for Show, Season Number, Episode ID and Episode Number.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat iTunes, AppleTV and iPad will respect this user-entered metadata and sort episodes by Show, then Season Number, then Episode Number.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes and AppleTV respect this order. iPad, however, respects it only to Season, and then sorts the episodes alphabetically by title, leading to a rather suboptimal viewing experience when watching series with continuous storylines.\r\n\r\niPad *does* respect episode order when viewing TV series purchased from the iTunes Store. I would expect it to honor user-modified metadata as well, but it does not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nLaunch firmware for iPad, no regression possible.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only way to get around this seems to be to use a third-party metadata editor such as MetaX to edit hidden metadata which is not user-editable in iTunes (which also seems to duplicate metadata which *is* user-editable in iTunes, and is really confusing when they're not the same)."
