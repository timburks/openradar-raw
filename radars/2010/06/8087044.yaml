    description: "lease allow us to use MPMediaPlayer itunes library access inside the simulator\r\n\r\nsimilar to rdar://7862936\r\n\r\nI'm starting on an exercise app that builds workouts from the playlists and library in the user's ipod library.  It would certainly help my learning and development to not have to always round-trip to the device to explore and test stuff.\r\n\r\nWhat Would Make Me Happiest is to have the simulator's \"music / ipod\"  world mirror what is on the itunes of the current user.  That way I can make playlists in itunes, run my app in the simulator, and see those new playlists."
