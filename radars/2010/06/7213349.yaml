    description: "Duplicate of radr://7214781\r\n\r\nSummary: 10.6 no longer obey's creator codes and thus it is no longer possible to attach a document to specific applications from code!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: create a document in hexedit, bbedit, etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: the document would belong to the creating program\r\n\r\nActual Results: document belongs to some 'default' program (textedit in bbedit's case)\r\n\r\nRegression: tested with various non-Apple products, always has the same issue. The default apps are Apple's, so using Apple's apps seems to attach documents correctly, when in fact it is not.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nCreator codes are _extremely_ valuable in Mac OS X and are one of the really great ways in which Mac OS X sets itself apart from Windows, linux, unix, etc.\r\n\r\nThe inability of programs to create documents that can be re-opened in the creating program by double-clicking on the document icons is a _serious_ problem for both end users and developers. I've tried explaining this to various HexEdit users, but they only understand that it no longer works.\r\n\r\nBeyond the document creation issue, the loss of this functionality removes a very valuable component from the Mac OS X filesystem.\r\n\r\nPlease, let us know what we can do to get Apple management to see the consequences of this decision so that they can restore a very marketable and valuable feature to Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNOTE: without this ability, I am finding that I _HATE_ using the Mac OS X finder, as _nothing_ works the way it used to. How irritating would Apple's management find it if they had to go through three steps to open every document they worked on instead of simply being able to double click on them?\r\n\r\nSeriously, this is incredibly broken!"
