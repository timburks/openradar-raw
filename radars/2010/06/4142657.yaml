    description: "Duplicate of radr://4141674\r\n\r\n08-Jun-2005 04:31 PM Lane Roathe:\r\nWhen updating an existing target for future systems by enabling PPC and Intel builds for combination into a universal binary, you can only target 10.3.9 or later systems.\r\n\r\nFor libraries, and applications with an existing install base, there is a need to target 10.2.8 (and even 10.1.5 on occasion). This seems easily solvable by adding a build target SDK in XCode, so that you have one target for PPC and one target for Intel.\r\n\r\nAlso, there needs to be a separate \"Which version of GCC\" to use option, as if you target 10.2.8 you have to use GCC 3.3 and not 4.0\r\n\r\nAnd, apparently you can edit the xcode file to set which SDK to use, but this should really be changeable via the UI.\r\n\r\n14-Jun-2005 05:29 PM Stoney Gamble:\r\nHi Lane, this is a known issue and is being tracked in our system under bug#4141674. Once this is addressed, I'll notify you of the resolution."
