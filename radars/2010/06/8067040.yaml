    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe iPad Maps application draws the directions line in blue, which is hard to distinguish from motorways on UK maps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Maps.app on iPad\r\n2. Search for directions from, for example, London to Birmingham.\r\n3. Zoom out to see the entire route in the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThat the directions route would be clearly visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBecause motorways are rendered in blue on UK maps, the route is barely distinguishable from other motorways. The only difference is a slight bevelled gloss on the route line.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe problem does not occur in countries where the map does not use blue for the roads.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the only countries in Google's map tiles that use blue for roads are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAttached are two screenshots of California and London illustrating the problem for the UK and the non-problem for other countries."
