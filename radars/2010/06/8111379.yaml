    description: "20-Jun-2010 02:47 AM Jesse Pearson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAs I don't believe this is even possible in any way by the API, it would be kind of nice to allow a toolbar button to present a form of iPad-style popover on the UI. It'd be nice to be able to leverage the content of the global HTML file and alter in a command callback.\r\n\r\nMy use case is a weather toolbar button. I use the badge property to present the current temperature, but I'd like to provide more quick-look information (without opening a new tab or window) when the button is clicked. I'd like to embed the radar image and/or a brief summary of weather alerts in a popover attached to the button so that it can be dismissed easily.\r\n\r\nI can envision many more use cases for this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSome method to leverage global HTML or a new resource type for a popover menu presentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo such access is present in the current API."
