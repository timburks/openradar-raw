    description: "At WWDC 2010 Xcode 4.0 was demonstrated with what appears to be fantastic support for managing source code repositories with git.\r\n\r\nThe git support is positively drool-worthy except for the fact that I use Mercurial, another distributed version control system. Although I don't have numbers, Mercurial is very widely used.\r\n\r\nI'm filing this to request, plead, beg, offer animal sacrifices if necessary, that Mercurial support be added in Xcode 4, matching as closely as possible the git support."
