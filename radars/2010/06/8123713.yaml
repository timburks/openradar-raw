    description: "The current implementation of the \"assign keyword\" command in iPhoto's Applescript dictionary can only be used to assign keywords to whichever photos are currently selected in iPhoto. This requires modifying the selection in iPhoto before each keyword assignment, and possible modifying which album is selected in iPhoto, if the scripter wants to guarantee that the photos they want to assign to are actually selectable (i.e. if an album happens to be selected that does not contain the desired photo(s)). This makes scripting this kind of thing both a hassle, and quite a bit slower because of the additional overhead of iPhoto having to modify the selection, redraw its window, etc.\r\n\r\nI would like to see a new, optional argument added to the \"assign keyword\" command that takes a list of photos to which you want to assign the keyword. When this argument is provided by the scripter, the keyword would be assigned directly to every photo in the list provided, rather than applying it to the current selection. This would make a much more elegant solution to the task of assigning a keyword to multiple photos at once."
