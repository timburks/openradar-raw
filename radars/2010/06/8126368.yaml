    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using apps that make heavy use of the network such as Pandora, the network connection will switch from Wi-Fi to cellular data without any notice to the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect to a Wi-Fi network.\r\nStart an application such as Pandora that makes heavy use of the network connection.\r\nSleep the device.\r\nAfter a period of time, unlock the device. (The actual delay seems to be indeterminate.) With Pandora, waiting for the track to change seems to be one trigger.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDevice is still using the Wi-Fi connection.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice is using cellular radio.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI realize that switching away from Wi-Fi can help with battery life, but given AT&T's recent change to no longer offer unlimited data plans, these kinds of silent switches between Wi-Fi and cellular network, especially when the user has not changed location and reasonably expects to still be using the same connection they began with, could result in surprising overages for unsuspecting users.\r\n\r\nEngineering asked me for device logs, so if you dupe this, you should also include logs:\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nCould you please attach your device log to the bug report. Device logs can be retrieved via the Organizer in Xcode. Or, from the iPhone Configuration Utility:\r\n\r\n1. Download and install iPCU from http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/\r\n2. Launch iPCU, then connect device with USB cable\r\n3. Click the Console tab in iPCU\r\n4. Reproduce the problem\r\n5. Click the “Save as” button to save the log to a text file.\r\n6. Attach the text file to the bug report"
