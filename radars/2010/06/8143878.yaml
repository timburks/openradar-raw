    description: "*** Summary:\r\n\r\nCannot drag contacts from Address Book into editable iCal calendar to create event with attendee.\r\n\r\n*** Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open iCal and select an editable calendar.\r\n2. Open Address Book.\r\n3. Click the card icon next to a contact's name in Address Book  and drag it into the iCal calendar.\r\n\r\n*** Expected Results:\r\n\r\nA new event in iCal with the person on the card as attendee as documented in the Address Book help files. See:\r\nfile:///Applications/Address%20Book.app/Contents/Resources/AddressBook.help/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/pgs/29160.html\r\n\r\n*** Actual Results:\r\n\r\nNo event created in iCal and an iCal notification stating: \r\n\r\n\"You can’t change events or to do items in the \"Home\" calendar.\r\nOnly the calendar administrator and any delegates with permission can make changes to read-only calendars. To make changes to the calendar, contact the calendar administrator.\"\r\n\r\n*** Regression:\r\n\r\nThis has become apparent since the 10.6.4 update.\r\n\r\n*** Notes:\r\n\r\nSee: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2465245\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no Console message when this happens.  \r\n\r\nI created a new local calendar in iCal called \"TEST 2\" to check this on. \r\n\r\nI have now also noticed the message is different in Week and Day view form the Month view.\r\n\r\nIn Month view we get an iCal notification stating: \r\n\r\n  \"You can’t change events or to do items in the \"TEST 2\" calendar.\r\nOnly the calendar administrator and any delegates with permission can make changes to read-only calendars. To make changes to the calendar, contact the calendar administrator.\"\r\n\r\nIn Week and Day view the notification says:\r\n\r\n  \"There was an error with the invitation.\r\nOnly the organizer can change this event. Contact the organizer to make changes.\"\r\n\r\nThe iCal calendar tested is a local calendar. Events can be written to the calendar using the iCal GUI.\r\n\r\nI'm running Mac OS X 10.6.4 (10F569), iCal Version 4.0.3 (1388) and Address Book Version 5.0.2 (870)\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2010 09:28 PM John Maisey:\r\nAlso see:\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2476078"
