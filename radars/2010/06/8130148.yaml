    description: "25-Jun-2010 10:10 AM Lukas Zeller:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nwhen using CFStream with a https URL, the kCFStreamSSLLevel (SSL security level) property which is supposed to have a default value of kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNegotiatedSSL according to docs, no longer does have this default value (it did in iPhoneOS 3.x). This breaks SSL connectivity with some servers (not all), which return a \"SSL illegal parameter\" alert.\r\n\r\nI consider this small bug as serious because it breaks connectivity with some perfectly valid SSL servers in a most obscure and hard to debug way.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a CFStream accessing a https URL, without setting any special kCFStreamPropertySSLSettings.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould work with all servers having valid certificates.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWorks as expected in iPhoneOS 3.x\r\n\r\nIn iOS 4.0, some servers return \"SSL illegal parameter\" alert (errSSLIllegalParam, -9830), despite perfectly valid certificates.\r\n\r\nSetting the kCFStreamSSLLevel in kCFStreamPropertySSLSettings to kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNegotiatedSSL explicitly (although according to docs and iPhoneOS 3.x reality this is the default value) makes the connection work as it did in iPhoneOS 3.x\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nCFStream based https connections used perfectly according to docs, which ran fine in iPhoneOS 3.x suddenly don't work with some servers in iOS 4. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA affected server is  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Although this is in the open internet, it is a private groupware server of a customer of ours that should not receive unusual exposure. So while it is ok to take a sample to verify the problem, please don't publish or otherwise highlight that URL.\r\n\r\n\r\n30-Jun-2010 20:27 CEST, Lukas Zeller:\r\nI have created a sample app which nicely demonstrates the issue, and that is is a regression. The sample runs fine on iPhoneOS 3.x (simulator and device) and fails when using defaults on iOS 4."
