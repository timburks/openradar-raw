    description: "Summary: After having installed iOS4 my iPod Touch 2G now drains it's battery overnight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Charge until full battery. Use lightly then close running app and lock screen. Return 8 hours later.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Battery level should not have changed significantly.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Battery is less than 20%.\r\n\r\nRegression: Battery used to keep overnight.\r\n\r\nNotes: This occurred the evening after I upgraded to iOS4 and has happened the two nights since as well. I have rebooted the iPod Touch today so will see if this makes any difference."
