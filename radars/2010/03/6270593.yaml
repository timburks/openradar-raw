    description: From what I can tell, Spotlight has special-cased com.apple.safari.history and com.apple.safari.bookmark to form a "Bookmarks" group. There should be a general UTI for bookmarks if it's going to be a prominent categorization, so that other browser vendors and anyone else making local bookmark files can have a reasonable type hierarchy and get the same UI treatment in Spotlight that Safari's files get.
