    description: "I not infrequently field help requests from users who report that one of their toolbar buttons has mysteriously vanished, and they don't know how to get it back. In each case, what has happen is that the user accidently made a very small command-drag and thus removed the item (without having any idea that they did so). Lots of users don't know how to customize the toolbar, so when this happens to them it's a serious, and from their perspective unfixable, loss of functionality.\r\n\r\nThe ability to rearrange one's toolbar while not in toolbar editing mode is of very marginal utility, and it comes at the cost of making it relatively easy to accidently carry out a destructive action with no apparent way of undoing it. Having it be easier to accomplish a destructive action than it is to find the means of reversing it is bad UI, and the toolbar would be more usable if the special meaning of command-drag were simply removed."
