    description: "The gcc generates incorrect stack sizes in the encodings, for which method_getSizeOfArguments() attempts to compensate by adding a \"fudge factor\".\r\nThis fudge factor is only added when the bug manifests and when a struct is returned by the method.\r\nThis fudge factor should also be added when the bug manifests and a union is returned by the method, but it is not."
