    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen saving .png files, Preview 4.0(467) generates incorrect values for the file's DPI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open some other format picture (tested with .icns).\r\n- Open the info panel - it will say \"72 dpi\".\r\n- Save as .png.\r\n- The info panel now will say \"72.01 dpi\".\r\n- Opening the .png file in (say) Photoshop confirms it's set to 72.009 dpi.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Should save as 72 dpi.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Saves as 72.009 dpi, which causes problems when processing the file later for some purposes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.1/PNG-Chunks.html#C.pHYs\r\nThe 'pHYs' chunk can specify either \"unknown unit\" (which makes the file default to 72 dpi when opened) or \"meter\". Preview now seems to generate the latter specification. As 72 dpi don't fit exactly into metric units, the measurement is rounded up, producing the 72.009 value.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nWhen saving 72 dpi pictures, specify \"unknown unit\" in the 'pHYs' chunk.\r\n\r\nNew information: Preview 5.0.1 (on Mac OS X 10.6.2) now rounds down the resolution incorrectly, showing 72 instead of 72.01. It still generates 72.009, however."
