When run, it will quickly crash a system.\r\n\r\n02-Feb-2010 03:46 PM Jean-Paul Calderone:\r\nIt occurs to me that a crash report from /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ going along with this crash might be helpful.  Perhaps someone else can reproduce this and get a crash report themselves that way, but it doesn't seem like it can hurt for me to attach one as well.\r\n\r\n(Note I can't see any comments aside from my own on this ticket.)\r\n\r\n02-Mar-2010 02:26 PM YVONNE  VILLA  :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
