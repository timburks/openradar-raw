    description: "There is a problem with the current downloading system of documentation in Xcode. \r\n\r\nBefore Xcode 3.2.x, there's an option to manually download or stop the specific documentation item. Now, there's only one option: Check for and install updates automatically.\r\n\r\nBy default this will hog the bandwidth of internet connection, in the case of when we only want to download one item. We also sometimes need to pause the download process and resume later. This is not possible, when the download stops, it just stops, and it could not be resumed."
