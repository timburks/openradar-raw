    description: "Summary: The UIDatePicker, when configured with a current date, and a minimum time 1 hour after, will display the hours column as disabled for all values, even when there are valid values, and it will allow selection. Just draw them disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a XIB with a UIDatePicker and set its current date, its Interval to 30, and its minimum date to 1 hour after the start date.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Date picker will allow selection and draw picker with proper drawing on all dates after the start date\r\n\r\nActual Results: Date Picker draws incorrectly\r\n\r\nRegression: Not sure if this ever worked correctly in the past\r\n\r\nNotes:"
