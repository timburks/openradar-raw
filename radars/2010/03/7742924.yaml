    description: "Safari 4 supports the iLO 2 (Integrated Lights-Out management) on HP's DL380 G5 models, but does *not* support the current version v1.81 (or v1.80) on the current G6 models.\r\n\r\nI see the Java background and large spinner, then they go away and I get a blank white box on grey background. I will send working (G5) and non-working (G6) screenshots of the applet."
