    description: "Summary:\r\nQuartz Display Services and/or AppKit should offer a way to capture the cursor currently being displayed on the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Call a Quartz function that returns a CGImage object containing a capture of the current cursor, or an AppKit method that returns an NSCursor object that is a capture of the current cursor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou receive such an object.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such function or method exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApps that could use this feature include applications that can take screenshots and applications that can record the screen.\r\n\r\nThe ideal interface for this would provide all frames of the cursor; the existing NSCursor class is designed for a single-frame (single-image) cursor. Expanding NSCursor to support animated cursors would be a nice related improvement.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to capture the current global cursor is through IOFramebuffer, which is poorly-documented and may be buggy; see x-radar://problem/7751503 and x-radar://problem/7751530 for two problems it has that I'm aware of."
