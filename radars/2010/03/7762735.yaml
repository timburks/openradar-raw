    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Provisioning Portal in the iPhone Developer Program, only the Team Agent is able to see items associated with distribution profiles. Due to legal implications, obviously only the Team Agent should be able to manage distribution certificates and provisioning profiles. But if the Team Agent is not technically skilled enough to handle the management of certificates and provisioning profiles, some other team member would need to assist in creating and maintaining certificates and profiles. If team members are in different physical locations, it is very hard for the non-agent to explain to the team agent what to do, since he/she can neither see the user interface used by the agent, neither monitor the process.\r\n\r\nIt would have been useful to let some team members other than the Team Agent to be able to see the user interface and a list of the items with non-sensitive information about them (i.e. create date, expiration date).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Let a person with the appropriate legal authority sign up for the iPhone Developer Program.\r\n2. Let him add the developers to the team, so that they can start developing.\r\n3. After a while, ask the team agent to create ad hoc and/or distribution profiles.\r\n4. Confused team agent screws up and asks developers for help.\r\n5. Off-site team member tries hard to blindly figure out what team agent should do, have done, what's been screwed up, and what needs to be done.\r\n6. After everything has been done right, explain to team agent that developers can't download distribution certificates and profiles from portal and that the team agent has to download and send over the files.\r\n7. Successfully build ad hoc- and distribution versions of the application.\r\n8. When distribution certificates and profiles eventually expires, ask team agent renew them.\r\n9. Back to step 4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTeam member with appropriate certificate and Xcode skills can easily prepare certificate signing requests, upload it to the provisioning portal, request a distribution provisioning profile with all the correct attributes for the project, and ask the team agent to login and approve the creation of items.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLots of confusion and remote hand-holding because team agent with inappropriate skills have to do advanced certificate and provisioning profile management.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe iPhone Developer Program requires that the Team Agent is legally authorized to bind the organization to the terms and conditions for the iPhone Developer Program, which in many cases is a person that is neither a developer nor a technically skilled person that can handle the challenges caused by managing X509 certificates and the Xcode provisioning profiles. In the cases when the Team Agent has the proper skills or can be assisted on site by skilled people, the above does not apply.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is somewhat related to: http://openradar.appspot.com/7729702"
