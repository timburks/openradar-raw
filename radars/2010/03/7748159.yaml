    description: "Summary: \r\nThere is a recurring problem with bad text rendering in Mac OS X when sub-pixel anti-aliasing is enabled. Screenshots of two examples are provided, from Calculator and Safari. They are not the only cases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure “Use LCD font smoothing when available” is not checked in the Appearance system prefs panel, and that you are in fact using an LCD screen at native resolution.\r\n2. Open Calculator and type some digits.\r\n3. Note that the text in the calculator display looks like text elsewhere in the system.\r\n4. Quit calculator.\r\n5. Enable “Use LCD font smoothing when available”.\r\n6. Repeat step 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSomewhat sharper text through the use of sub-pixel anti-aliasing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHorrible text with knobs on.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem is known to occur in Mac OS X 10.5 and Mac OS X 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe text looks as though a sharpen filter has been applied to it, but a more likely explanation is that SPAA text has been converted to greyscale (badly) and used as a mask.\r\n\r\nThe Safari example comes from http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ibooks.html . The page uses Webkit CSS extensions that are likely implemented using texture-based rendering; the absence of three-channel blending modes would explain the need to revert to greyscale text, but not the awful quality of the generated outlines.\r\n\r\nThere is an apparently unrelated example of bad text rendering in Calculator, namely the √ button in Scientific mode. This appears to be merely a badly rendered icon."
