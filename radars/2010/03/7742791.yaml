    description: "Please bring back the ability for the Finder to respect an document's creator code in some fashion (even if it's an xattr that references the bundle ID of the creating application).  I depend on this functionality when editing graphic files created in different programs (even though many are the same type).\r\n\r\nI've been using Mac OS longer than you've been working on it.  Please don't make arbitrary decisions that break my workflow!"
