    description: "There is currently no way to test proper network reachability handling in iPhone OS applications using the tools provided in the iPhone SDK. Accordingly, Instruments needs a new tool that would enable developers to selectively enable and disable the various network interfaces (cellular radio, EDGE or 3G separately if possible, and wifi) of their devices while they are connected.\r\n\r\nThis would enable developers to test how their applications handle changes in the network state (say, if the phone drops from a wifi network) while the application is running, which is not something we can directly test in a reliable and consistent manner, especially when considering changes in the cellular radio status."
