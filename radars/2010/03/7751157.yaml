    description: "Certain Apple-provided types appear to get special treatment when they are displayed in the Finder or the Spotlight search results, showing their kMDItemDisplayName instead of the file name. I can't find any way to get my own types to get the same behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Declare a custom type\r\n2) Write an importer for it that populates kMDItemDisplayName\r\n3) Import some files\r\n4) Search for them\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nkMDItemDisplayName should be shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe raw file name is shown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe reason I expect this to work is that the .webbookmark type used by Safari's bookmarks behaves this way. They are flat files, not document bundles, and their names are just UUIDs. When searched for, however, they show the kMDItemDisplayName.\r\n\r\nI'm making a new type and importer for Camino bookmarks, and if I name them by UUID that's all that shows up, even though I have compared the output of mdimport -d2 between the two types of files and see no relevant differences.\r\n\r\nIf there is a way to get this working for third-party importers I would very much like to know the work-around."
