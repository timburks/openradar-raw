    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSliders in Mac OS X do not offer the iPhone OS's variable speed scrubbing feature, causing precise scrubbing to be impossible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Click and hold on a slider.\r\n2) While holding down the mouse button, move the mouse cursor up.\r\n3) Move the mouse cursor left or right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe scrubbing speed of the slider will change depending on how far away the mouse cursor is from the slider, like the Music app from the iPhone OS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe scrubbing speed does not change.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhile this is not a critical feature, adding it would certainly improve the user experience for Mac OS X.  Sliders, particularly for media control, are rather imprecise.  For instance, while watching a feature length movie, even with precise mouse movements, scrubbing tends to skip in 30 or so second chunks.  The iPhone's sliders make it possible to scroll in single second chunks, enabling users to pick a precise point, not just some point in the media close to what they were looking for."
