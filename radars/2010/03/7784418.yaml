    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an application links to the MediaPlayer framework, images from the application bundle get in conflict with images from the framework.\r\n\r\nIf an image from the application bundle has the same name as an image from the MediaPlayer framework, the UIImage imageNamed: method might return the image from the framework or return the image from the application bundle.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample project that links to the MediaPlayer framework. The application bundle contains an image named \"pause.png\". The MediaPlayer framework also contains an image named \"pause.png\".\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The problem occurs both on the device and the simulator.\r\n- One workaround is to load images using the imageWithContentsOfFile: method instead."
