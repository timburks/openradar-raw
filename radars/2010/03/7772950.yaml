    description: "19-Mar-2010 05:08 PM TIG CSAIL:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAttempts to drag a file or folder into a folder stored in AFS with \"list\" and \"insert\" permissions, fail with a \"prohibited\" mouse pointer.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install OpenAFS 1.4.12 from http://dl.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.4.12/\r\n2. Create file \"foo\" (eg 'date > foo')\r\n3. In Finder, attempt to drag \"foo\" into /afs/csail.mit.edu/u/a/arthurp/public/incoming\r\n(Note: no authentication to OpenAFS is necessary; that directory has \"system:anyuser li\" permissions.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNormal mouse pointer that would allow me to release the mouse button and copy the item\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Prohibited\" mouse pointer; releasing the mouse button has no effect\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWith OpenAFS 1.4.12 under Mac OS 10.5.8, symptoms are identical.\r\n\r\nWith OpenAFS 1.4.11 under Mac OS 10.5.8, Finder gives a \"prohibited\" mouse pointer but when the mouse button is released, the file is actually copied.\r\n\r\nUsing \"cp\" from the command line completes without incident in all cases.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a duplicate (worked example) of rdar://7754301"
