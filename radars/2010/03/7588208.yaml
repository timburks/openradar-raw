    description: "Summary: A draft email message, when interrupted, will re-appear in Messages even after sending it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a text message with an email address (e.g. content of message is \"Here is Joe's email address joe@me.com\")\r\n2. Tap on email address to start creating new mail message\r\n3. Start writing a message, but do not send yet\r\n4. Tap HOME button\r\n5. Go to another application (e.g. Safari)\r\n6. Tap HOME button\r\n7. Go to Messages\r\n8. The draft email will re-appear\r\n9. Tap Send, wait for mail message to go away\r\n10. Tap HOME button\r\n11. Go to Messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe draft mail message should not appear when you load the Messages app, as it has been sent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe draft mail message appears every time that Messages is launched. The only way to get rid of it is to press \"Cancel\" and select either \"Don't save\" or \"Save\".\r\n\r\nNote that the message *is* sent, even though the draft re-appears.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Engineering believes this issue has been addressed in iPhone OS 4.0 beta seed 2.
