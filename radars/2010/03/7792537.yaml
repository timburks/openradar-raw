    description: "SUMMARY:\r\nRemoving a Genius recommendation while loading more recommendations on iPhone will cause App Store.app to crash consistently.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Open App Store.app on iPhone.\r\n2. Select Featured tab, and then Genius filter.\r\n3. Scroll to bottom of the table view so that \"More Recommendations...\" is visible.\r\n4. Tap \"More Recommendations...\" and while iPhone is loading the new results, swipe a recommended app's table cell, and tap the \"Remove\" button.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nApp Store.app removes the recommendation from the Genius list and continues to load more recommendations.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nApp Store.app crashes, returning the user to the springboard.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n1. The crash is reproducible on demand.\r\n2. It may be easier to reproduce this crash on 3G or EDGE, as results will take slightly longer to load than on WiFi, giving the tester time to swipe and remove a recommendation."
