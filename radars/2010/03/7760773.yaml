    description: "If you launch your application in landscape in the Simulator, you'll get a properly positioned status bar, but the launchOptions parameter of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: is nil, and the current interfaceOrientation of the UIApplication is still set to UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait. An initial UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification is never sent. The Default-Landscape.png is displayed properly, however.\r\n\r\nif I manually set the UIApplication's interfaceOrientation, everything works fine, but, of course, I have no way of knowing what to set it to. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I'm currently opening with the sim in landscape, the status bar in the correct position, but the application content in portrait mode."
