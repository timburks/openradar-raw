    description: "Summary:\r\nThe cursor structure returned to applications by the IOFramebuffer API does not indicate what format the cursor pixels are in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Call CGDisplayIOServicePort to get a service port for a display.\r\n2. Call IOFramebufferOpen to get a connection port to its framebuffer.\r\n3. Call IOConnectMapMemory with the kIOFBCursorMemory mapping type to map the cursor structure into application memory.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe structure includes a description of the format that the cursor's pixels are in, including bytes per pixel, presence or absence of alpha, bit layout (e.g., RGBA vs. ARGB or 5-5-5 vs. 5-6-5), and whether the color components are premultiplied by the alpha component.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe structure does not include any information about pixel formats.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI believe I would have to go all the way back to Classic Mac OS for that.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCurrently, my code assumes 32-bit ARGB in native byte order. This is currently right most of the time, but not all of the time, and I would prefer to not have to assume."
