    description: "Summary: \r\n__FILE__ always returns a full path.  There are times I'd like it to just show the path relative to the root of the project, or even just the file name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nI'd like there to be the option for Xcode to be aware of the current directory when issuing GCC so that the __FILE__ operative returns the desired path (http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2002-01/msg00253.html).  This would be a build style setting, ideally, consisting of \"Full path\", \"From project root\", and \"Filename only\"."
