    description: "With the rapid growth if the iPhone, many workplaces now support iTunes in their desktop environment.  This is find and good, except that it remains extremely difficult to manage patching of Apple software (QuickTime, iTunes, Bonjour, MobileMe) in a coordinated manner.  Patch management systems (LANDesk, Altiris, Lumension/Patchlink, etc) all attempt to aid in patching of Apple software on Windows, but it's problematic in all cases.\r\n\r\nThis situation would be greatly improved if Apple Software Update had a commandline equivalent, similar to softwareupdate on OS X.  Whether a Windows implementation might be a standard .exe binary, or special hooks available in the PowerShell environment is less of a consideration.\r\n\r\nPlease add commandline support to Apple Software Update on Windows.\r\n\r\nAddendum: It would also be just dandy if the various packages were available as discrete MSI packages for Windows Installer."
