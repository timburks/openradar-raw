    description: "30-Mar-2010 10:59 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCFString.h defines CF_FORMAT_FUNCTION() and CF_FORMAT_ARGUMENT() when __GNUC__*10+__GNUC_MINOR__ >= 42 is true, but doesn't check that this is Apple GCC as opposed to mainline GCC. This makes gcc 4.2+ fail to compile it, since they don't support the __attribute__s used.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice for this to be fixed as the availability of newer gccs is useful, and probably always will be, when porting programs from other systems that were developed with them.\r\n\r\nIt can be fixed by checking defined(__APPLE_CC__) until some other compiler supports them (which is unlikely as CFString is pretty system-specific).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n> cat cf-compile-failure.c \r\n#include <CoreFoundation/CoreFoundation.h>\r\n> /usr/local/gcc45/bin/gcc -v\r\nUsing built-in specs.\r\nCOLLECT_GCC=/usr/local/gcc45/bin/gcc\r\nCOLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/local/gcc45/libexec/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin10.2.0/4.5.0/lto-wrapper\r\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin10.2.0\r\nConfigured with: ../gcc/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc45 --with-arch=native --with-tune=native --disable-nls --disable-bootstrap --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,obj-c++ LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include\r\nThread model: posix\r\ngcc version 4.5.0 20100325 (experimental) (GCC) \r\n> /usr/local/gcc45/bin/gcc -c cf-compile-failure.c \r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nCompiling.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nIn file included from /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Headers/CoreFoundation.h:43:0,\r\n                 from cf-compile-failure.c:1:\r\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Headers/CFBundle.h:147:1: error: format string argument not a string type"
