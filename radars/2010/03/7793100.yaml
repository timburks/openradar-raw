    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter starting to edit an existing event (must include invitees) in iCal that is on an Exchange calendar there is no way to exit the dialog without an update being sent to the invitees.  This is problematic when you accidentally enter the editing dialog, make a minor change, and have no way to exit.  Restarting iCal does not even allow the user to exit the dialog.  It will reappear when iCal is next launched.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create event in iCal within an Exchange calendar with at least one invitee, click done.\r\n2) Re-open the event that was just created.\r\n3) Change the title of the event to something different than what is was before\r\n4) Revert the title back the title to what it was before\r\n5) Attempt to exit the edit dialog without sending an update to the invitee(s)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can not exit the edit dialog without sending an update to the invitee(s)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHave a way to exit the edit dialog without sending an update to the invitee(s)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis might be accomplished with an cancel button in the event dialog and or in the 'You’re about to send changes for “<TITLE>”.' message window.  Attached are screenshots showing the windows referenced in this bug."
