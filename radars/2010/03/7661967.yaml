    description: "18-Feb-2010 02:25 AM Lowell:\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen dropping an alias onto the Finder's sidebar, it takes the name of the target, not the alias. This is an issue because, in order to organize the sidebar, a user may want to have an alias have a different name than the target.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select item in Finder.\r\n2. Hit command-L.\r\n3. Rename alias to anything other than target.\r\n4. Drag and drop onto sidebar.\r\n5. The sidebar displays the target, not the alias.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe sidebar would ideally display the alias.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sidebar displays the target, not the alias.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nApplies to both aliases and symlinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23-Feb-2010 01:06 PM YVONNE  :\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended."
