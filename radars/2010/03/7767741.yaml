    description: "There is no way nowadays to either \"pause\" the current Animation at the frame/image where it's at when we would like to \"pause\" it or even to know which image is displayed at a given time.\r\n\r\nTo understand what I do just have a look at http://sevensnap.com - The \"cards\" (price & time) are done with a set of UIImageView being one anothers' delegate.\r\n\r\nRight now when somebody buys a Product I have to set the price to xxxx.x0 because I have no way to know the Y in xxxx.xY\r\n\r\nI can provide a very basic sample code if necessary."
