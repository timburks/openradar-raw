    description: "Summary:\r\nProviding support for an insert-only (no delete) dropbox in a VFS-providing kext appears to require lying to finder about offering delete permissions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a directory in a filesystem which will respond affirmative for KAUTH_VNODE_ADD_FILE and KAUTH_VNODE_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY but not for  KAUTH_VNODE_DELETE_CHILD.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo be allowed to drag files/directories into the directory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGot the \"do not enter\" sign.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have only tried this on versions of 10.6. It fails consistently. mv or cp from the command line work fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHooking our access vnop I see that KAUTH_VNODE_ADD_FILE, KAUTH_VNODE_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY, KAUTH_VNODE_DELETE_CHILD are only checked for all together; If I lie and don't say KAUTH_VNODE_DELETE_CHILD isn't supported, but instead only return errors when an unlink is attempted, I can then insert files into the dropbox."
