    description: "10-Mar-2010 01:38 PM William McGrath:\r\nSummary: \r\nActive Directory users that use Podcast Capture to upload a podcast to their own blogs fail to post their podcast.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a workflow in Podcast Composer that publishes podcasts to an Apple Wiki Server to the 'submitted user's blog'.\r\n2. Log into My Site as an Active Directory user and create a blog for them.\r\n3. Log into Podcast Capture as an Active Directory user and submit a podcast to the workflow you created in step 1.\r\n4. Check the Xgrid logs on the Xgrid controller. After about 5-10 minutes, the initial steps of the workflow (transcoding, etc) would have been completed. When it attempts to publish to wikiserver, the task fails.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe podcast should publish to the blog of the Active Directory user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWithin the system logging, you can find a failure message such as this:\r\n\r\nMar 10 12:50:55 xserve pcastaction[39526]: PodcastProducer::Actions::WikiServer: XML-RPC returned error: Unauthorized session_id ED3837B0-2340-4988-BECA-0063F69DAB0F\r\nMar 10 12:50:55 xserve xgridagentd[36674]: Notice: agent task \"39526\" failed for user \"administrator\" executable \"/usr/bin/pcastaction\" arguments (\\n    wikiserver,\\n    \"--prb=/Volumes/Storage/Collaboration/Podcast/UUIDs/4052F240-F6AE-4D32-901B-CF7FC0BB0DDC.prb\",\\n    \"--input=export-plugin-quicktime-E43D860D-31BB-454F-83AD-B2ECFFED9E92.m4v\",\\n    \"--docroot=/Volumes/Storage/Collaboration/Podcast/Podcasts\",\\n    \"--url=http://xserve:8171\",\\n    \"--posting_url=http://xserve/users/william/blog\",\\n    \"--username=pcastadmin\",\\n    \"--otp=SGfaAzhYXc6VisoIfKqdJA==\",\\n    \"--pcast_server=https://xserve:8170/podcastproducer\",\\n    \"--outfile=publish-plugin-wikiserver-50b87bf6b6cd659fdcc14f50d79bafcf.yaml\",\\n    \"--mimetype=video/x-m4v\"\\n)\r\nMar 10 12:50:55 xserve xgridcontrollerd[36668]: Notice: controller job \"29\" state changed to \"Failed\"\r\nMar 10 12:50:59 xserve pcastserverd[36815]: Xgrid Job: 29 is Failed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem has been ongoing since 10.6's release.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA number of other users are experiencing this issue, according to mailing lists.\r\nhttp://osdir.com/ml/podcast-producer/2010-01/msg00029.html"
