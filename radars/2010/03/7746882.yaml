    description: "Summary: \r\nIn Safari, when more than one tab is open in the key window, Command-W is the keyboard shortcut for Close Tab, and Command-Shift-W for Close Window. When only one tab is open in the key window, Command-W is the shortcut for Close Window and the Close Tab command is disabled. However, whenever the Help menu is opened, the shortcuts revert to the single-tab configuration (regardless of the state of the key window) and stay that way until the next time a window with multiple tabs is made key.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In any Safari window, create two or more tabs.\r\n2. Open the File menu and observe that Close Tab is enabled and has shortcut Command-W, and Close Window has shortcut Command-Shift-W.\r\n3. Open the Help menu (it is not necessary to select anything).\r\n4. Open the File menu again and look at the Close Window and Close Tab items.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe shortcuts and enabled/disabled status of those two items should be unchanged from Step 2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClose Window is now Command-W, and Close Tab (while still enabled) has no shortcut.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nObserved in Safari 4.0.4 and 4.0.5 on Mac OS 10.6.2. Not tested in any prior OS or application versions."
