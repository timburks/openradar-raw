    description: "XMPP is a widely used protocol for IM and it will also be used for voice.\r\n\r\niPhone Developers had noticed that there is a private XMPP framework in the iPhone SDK. It would be beneficial for our software development effort if this XMPP framework is made public.\r\n\r\nCurrent open source implementation of XMPP framework using Cocoa is not as good enough as iChat on the Mac for example.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if either Apple support the progress of open source Cocoa framework, or provide this as one of the framework in the Mac OS X and iPhone OS SDK."
