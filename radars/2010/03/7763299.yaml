    description: "17-Mar-2010 12:46 PM John Engelhart:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Strings/Articles/FormatStrings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000943-SW2\r\n\r\nWhen this bug report was filed, the last entry in the \"revision\" section was \"2009-10-15 - Added links to Cocoa Core Competencies.\"\r\n\r\nFrom \"Formatting String Objects\"- (begin quote)\r\n\r\nStrings and Non-ASCII Characters\r\n\r\nYou can include non-ASCII characters (including Unicode) in strings using methods such as stringWithFormat: and stringWithUTF8String:.\r\n\r\nNSString *s = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"Long %C dash\", 0x2014];\r\n\r\nSince \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is the 3-byte UTF-8 string for 0x2014, you could also write:\r\n\r\nNSString *s = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:\"Long \\xe2\\x80\\x94\tdash\"];\r\n\r\nIt is not safe is to include high-bit characters in your source code:\r\n\r\nNSString *s = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:\"Long — dash\"];\r\nNSString *s = @\"Long — dash\";\t// Not allowed\r\n\r\n(end quote)\r\n\r\nThe last part, the part about \"It is not safe is to include high-bit characters in your source code:\", is no longer true as of Mac OS X 10.5.  `gcc` was modified so that @\"\" string constants could contain \"high-bit\" characters (actually, Unicode).\r\n\r\nFor reference, from the \"Objective-C Programming Language\", Appendix A, Compiler Directives ( http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocLanguageSummary.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH3-TPXREF104 )\r\n\r\n@\"string\" - Defines a constant NSString object in the current module and initializes the object with the specified string.\r\nOn Mac OS X v10.4 and earlier, the string must be 7-bit ASCII-encoded. On Mac OS X v10.5 and later (with Xcode 3.0 and later), you can also use UTF-16 encoded strings. (The runtime from Mac OS X v10.2 and later supports UTF-16 encoded strings, so if you use Mac OS X v10.5 to compile an application for Mac OS X v10.2 and later, you can use UTF-16 encoded strings.)"
