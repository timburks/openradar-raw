    description: "Summary:\r\nBroken aliases to image files can crash the Desktop PreferencePane if you try to browse the directory containing the alias.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Make a broken alias to a jpg[0] file in ~/Pictures.\r\n2. Open System Preferences.\r\n3. Open Desktop/Screen Saver\r\n4. Attempt to pick the Pictures folder from the folders list on the left side of the Desktop tab.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nI can pick a spiffy new desktop background.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nBeachball followed by crash with a fun traceback.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown. Was hard enough to run into this as it is.\r\n\r\n[0] I didn't test other formats, but presumably _any_ format supported for a desktop background would work. Broken aliases are hard enough to make intentionally I didn't bother testing beyond the handful of jpeg aliases I had discovered."
