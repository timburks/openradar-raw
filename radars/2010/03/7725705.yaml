    description: "Currently, output from OCUnit test methods written via NSLog/printf/etc. appear at the bottom of the build log when a unit test target is built. (If it is run for multiple architectures and/or under both GC and RR modes, the output appears after each run of the test bundle.) It would make debugging significantly easier if the output appeared between the \"started\" and \"passed\"/\"failed\" output, just as test failures do.\r\n\r\nOne possibility for doing this would be to create a STLog() macro (analogous to NSLog, but which could capture __FILE__, __LINE__, and/or __func__) which accepts variadic arguments and passes the resulting string in the same way test failures are recorded. This would allow log statements to be interwoven with assertion failures so context is easier to discover. This can be useful whether the test passed or failed, and would be especially valuable for preventing output from multiple tests from getting lumped together.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement is similar to the request to add a STWarn() macro that issues a warning rather than failure. <rdar://problem/5576279>"
