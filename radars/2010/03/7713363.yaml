    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using System Image Utility 10.6.2 and attempting to create a NetRestore image the iTunes 9.0.4 installer launches iTunesHelper as a postinstall action which doesn't allow hdiutil to unmount the temporary sparse image. \r\n\r\nI wrote a bash script that just watched for the iTunesHelper process and killed it once it showed up.  This allows System Image Utility to finish successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse System Image Utility with the follow 3 workflows:\r\n1) Define Image Source (use standard Mac OS X Install DVD)\r\n2) Add Packages and Post-Install Scripts (add the iTunes 9.0.4 installer downloaded from Apple)\r\n3) Create Image (create a NetRestore image)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn ASR Image with 10.6 and the current version of iTunes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWatch System Image Utilities log ~/Library/Logs/System Image Utility.  Notice once the installers are done hdiutil tries to unmount the temporary sparse image and cannot.  Tries for several minutes and then gives up.  System Image Utility reports image creation failed.\r\n\r\nIf you kill the iTunesHelper process as soon as it shows up, hdiutil unmounts the sparse image with no problem and the ASR image creation finishes as it should."
