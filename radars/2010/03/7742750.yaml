    description: "Developers need a way to transfer iPhone app ownership.\r\n\r\nAs App Store matures, it becomes more common for the intellectual property of an app to become a marketable item -- a sort of 21st century version of \"...and then get bought by Microsoft\", as business plans go.\r\n\r\nThere is currently not a smooth way to transfer an app, once it is tied to a developer's account.  To move the app, one has to hand over the developer account which, in addition to having all of the developer's history and data, may also have other apps associated with it.\r\n\r\nApple discourages us from creating several accounts for the same developer, hence blocking the only current viable workaround: create a separate account to hold each app.\r\n\r\nThe iTunesConnect Manage Apps page needs a way to say \"transfer ownership of this app to this other ITC account.\"\r\n\r\nFeature suggestions: there should probably be some sort of confirmation and timeout.  So the process might go:\r\n\r\n* Me: Transfer app-Foo to Johnny Appleseed.\r\n* JA: gets email \"Ted is transferring app-Foo, click this link within 24 hrs.\"\r\n  (If he doesn't transfer request is cancelled.)\r\n* JA: Clicks link.\r\n* App transfers.\r\n* Both JA and I get email \"App-Foo has been moved from Ted's account to JA's\"\r\n\r\n\"...or something like that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
