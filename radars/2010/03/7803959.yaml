    description: "Summary: While a text message is being sent, the text will not copy to the clipboard even though the visual queues make it seem like the text is copied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Copy some text into the clipboard (from any app).\r\n2. Write a new text message.\r\n3. (This step is sometimes difficult if the message is sent fast.) Press Send and while it is sending, tap and hold on the outgoing message.\r\n4. Tap Copy.\r\n5. In the text writing area, tap to bring up the Paste menu.\r\n6. Tap Paste.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text that is copied in step 3 should be pasted. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text that is copied in step 1 is pasted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI came across the bug while a text message was taking a very long time to send. I wanted to copy it for later since the message didn't seem to be going through."
