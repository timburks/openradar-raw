They do the same as some letters;\r\nup -> A\r\ndown -> B\r\nright -> C\r\nleft -> D\r\nAll capital.\r\nThis effects every ncurses based program...\r\n\r\nSeems to be the same issue under the regular (desktop) version of Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n05-Apr-2010 03:50 PM Olav Immanuel Børjesson:\r\nThis is critical for some of the functionality of my server. Please release a fix asap. Ive tried building it myself, but cant get the linking right when recompiling the programs dependent on ncurses..."
