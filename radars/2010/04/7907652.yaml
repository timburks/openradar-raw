    description: "It would be great if there was a way to turn the iPad into a standalone touch-screen 'kiosk.' In this mode all physical buttons would be ignored and a single app would run continuously. Kiosk mode should also work whether the physical buttons are exposed or not. In other words, it shouldn't rely on a separate physical enclosure to protect the device from tampering.\r\n\r\nThe device could then be mounted so the public could use an app to obtain information, fill in forms, or to try out an app without having to worry about someone stopping the app or messing with the underlying system.\r\n\r\nThere would have to be a way (perhaps a custom touch pattern) to bring the app out of kiosk mode and back to normal mode. Such a scheme should be app-selectable so knowledgeable end-users wouldn't be able to walk up and take the device back to Springboard.\r\n\r\nKiosk mode should also outlast a power-cycle, so if a device is left unattended and the power goes out or an end-user finds access to the screen-lock/home buttons, they wouldn't be able to break out of it by simply rebooting the device. If the developer forgets how to unlock the device or there is a malfunction, the only way out would be via syncing with iTunes.\r\n\r\nThere are a wide range of applications, from public areas (museums, movie theaters, trade shows, etc.) to private gatherings (PTA meetings, group sign-up forms) to individual (training or tutoring, photo slideshow, demoware) where a secure, single-app kiosk-mode would come handy."
