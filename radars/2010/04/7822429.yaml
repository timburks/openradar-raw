    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen calling setCurrentTime on a AVAudioPlayer object, which is currently playing a file, it jumps to the correct position, but querying currentTime after that returns wrong values.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have attached a sample project. The application plays an audio file and skips to entered position. The values of currentTime are retrieved every second using a timer and are output to the console.\r\nLet the sound play for a few seconds and then tap the seek button, it seeks to the start (if the value in the text field isn't changed). The console output then shows negative values for currentTime.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncurrentTime shouldn't have negative values, but instead return the actual time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncurrentTime is negative or hangs behind the actual current time of the playing file.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on iPhone 3GS with 3.1.2 and Simulator with 3.1.3 and 3.2 using GM iPhone SDK 3.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project is attached.\r\nYou may download the sample project here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/80399/AudioTest.zip"
