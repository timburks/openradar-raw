    description: "Summary:\r\nThe most obvious sign of this problem is that a computer will be visible in a Finder window's sidebar, but will be unable to connect. Pinging the computer's IP (e.g., 192.168.1.253) or .local hostname (e.g., iMac.local) will not work (100% packet loss). If I physically go to the computer, it will have Internet access and can see/ping the Time Capsule router, but will also be unable to connect to my computer in the Finder or via pings. I've also experienced similar problems connecting to a printer on the AirPort network. In the case of the printer, I can see the printer's web interface advertised via the Bonjour bookmarks in Safari, but will be unable to connect to that webpage or successfully print.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHere is the configuration that I'm using in which the problem appears. It may also appear in other configurations\r\n\r\nTime Capsule (Simultaneous Dual-Band):\r\n\tWireless Mode: Create a wireless network\r\n\tRadio Mode & Channel Selection: Automatic\r\n\tWireless Security: WPA2 Personal\r\n\tConnect Using: Ethernet\r\n\tEthernet WAN Port: Automatic\r\n\tConnection Sharing: Share a public IP address\r\n\tConfigure IPv4: Using DHCP\r\n\tDHCP Beginning Address: 192.168.1.2\r\n\tDHCP Lease: 1 days\r\n\tEnabled default host at: 192.168.1.253\r\n\tEnabled NAT Port Mapping Protocol\r\n\tIPv6 Mode: Link-local only\r\n\t\r\niMac (AirPort):\r\n\tConfigure IPv4: Using DHCP with manual address\r\n\tIP Address: 192.168.1.253\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro (AirPort):\r\n\tConfigure IPv4: Using DHCP\r\n\r\n1. Enable screen and file sharing on the iMac and the MacBook Pro.\r\n2. Attempt to connect to the iMac from the MacBook Pro via a Finder window sidebar.\r\n3. If connection is successful, disconnect and close the Finder window, wait an arbitrary amount of time and try connecting again until it fails.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll computers and devices on the local AirPort network should be reachable and no connection failures should occur.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nComputers and other devices (printers) will be intermittently unreachable although they are not asleep and can ping the router.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAt work, if I inactivated all services except AirPort, I couldn't connect to the Mac mini on my desk or print to the office printer. Activating the Ethernet service allowed connections to other Macs and printers as expected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2406418\r\n\r\nI've tried turning IPv6 off, inactivating all interfaces except AirPort on all computers, and reseting the Time Capsule. traceroute doesn't help. It seems this is a very deep problem related to AirPort networking in Mac OS X. I don't believe this is a signal strength issue since I encounter this problem with computers in the same room.\r\n\r\n22-Apr-2010 01:41 AM:\r\nWhen I am able to connect, I see these entries in netstat -ral:\r\n\r\nInternet:\r\nDestination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use    Mtu   Netif Expire\r\n192.168.1.253      0:24:36:b5:7c:55   UHLWI           4      180   1500     en1   1186\r\n\r\nInternet6:\r\nDestination                             Gateway                         Flags        Refs      Use    Mtu    Netif Expire\r\ntotoro.local                            0:24:36:b5:7c:55                UHLW            0        3   1500      en1\r\n\r\nWhen the connection fails, I see this:\r\n\r\nInternet:\r\nDestination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use    Mtu   Netif Expire\r\n192.168.1.253      link#5             UHRLWI          1        8   1500     en1      9\r\n\r\nInternet6:\r\nDestination                             Gateway                         Flags        Refs      Use    Mtu    Netif Expire\r\n(the totoro.local entry that used to be here is missing)\r\n\r\nFWIW, I've had luck in getting this to fail by putting my computer to sleep, waiting a few minutes, waking it up, and then attempting the connection again.\r\n\r\nAlso, running \"dns-sd  -B _afpovertcp._tcp.\" still shows this computer:\r\n\r\nBrowsing for _afpovertcp._tcp.\r\nTimestamp     A/R Flags if Domain                    Service Type              Instance Name\r\n 1:36:57.205  Add     3  0 username.members.mac.com.  _afpovertcp._tcp.         Totoro\r\n 1:36:57.205  Add     2  5 local.                    _afpovertcp._tcp.         Totoro\r\n\r\nThis is probably why it still appears in the Finder sidebar.\r\n\r\n02-May-2010 11:51 PM:\r\nI've also found that turning off AirPort and turning it back on will often fix the problem for a while, but it will eventually return.\r\n\r\n20-Dec-2010 01:13 AM John Grigutis:\r\nSince installing the 7.5.2 (75200.14) firmware on my Time Capsule, I haven't experienced this problem. So this issue might have been caused by a bug the the previous 7.4.2 Time Capsule firmware."
