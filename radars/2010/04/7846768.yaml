    description: "Summary:\r\niPhone forgets that it has already shown notices for past events, and will pop them up again.  Repeatedly.  At inopportune times.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm not certain of all of the situations that trigger this, but my guess is that it's any time the iPhone resyncs with the calendar.  Synching the device in iTunes seems to trigger this, too.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhone syncs, life goes on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhone happily dumps notices for every single event on your calendar for the past three months on you, in one giant lump.  Complete with notification noises.\r\n\r\nThis is /extremely/ annoying, especially as they'll come in several 'bursts' where you get nearly all of them, and then 10-15 seconds later, a few more. I recognize this is a beta build, of course, but this actually impacts the ability to test items built for 4.0 on the device.  You'll be in the middle of running a debugger session, and suddenly approximately 4 billion calendar notices pop up. \r\n \r\n(\"Beedoo... beedoo... beedoobeedoobeedoo... beedoo... beedoo.\"  \"Hrgh.  At least that's over.  Now I can dismiss them and...\"  \"Beedoo!  Beedoo...beedoo beedoo beedoobeedoobeedoo.\"  \"Oh, good grief!  Are you done yet?  Can I finish my debugging?\"  \"...\"  \"Right, then. Now, we'll go back and...\"  \"Beedoo!\"  \"AAAAAAAUGH!\")\r\n\r\nRegression/Notes:\r\nI'm synching calendars with my MobileMe account, pulling my Google Calendar in through MobileMe.  I'm not certain if that would have any specific effect on things.  (Heck, I'm synching through an old .Mac account, because I refuse to switch from @mac.com to @me.com, so maybe /that's/ one of the causes.)  \r\n\r\nI'm going to experiment with synching directly to my Google Calendar instead and see if the problem still occurs, and can update this ticket if so."
