    description: "The API for controlling the device's hardware display brightness, as used in the iBooks app, should be made public to benefit other applications.\r\n\r\nApplications such as Kindle and Instapaper Pro (mine) simulate brightness controls with translucent dimming overlay views, but the results are far inferior to a true brightness control for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The brightness range we can achieve by this method is much smaller than the range achieved by a hardware API.\r\n2. This method does not reduce power consumption.\r\n3. This method cannot achieve deep black levels due to the way LCDs work.\r\n4. This method cannot \"dim\" popovers, alert views, or system overlays such as the mail composer.\r\n5. This method requires far more work for developers, as the \"dimming\" overlay views must be added separately to every view controller.\r\n6. This method negatively impacts performance by requiring a full-screen alpha blend whenever dimming is active."
