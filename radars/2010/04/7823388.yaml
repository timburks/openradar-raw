    description: "I have a 16 month old child. I like to let him play with my iPhone and intend to let him play with my iPad soon after it arrives tomorrow. He already understands that his touches affect the screen and enjoys seeing it change in response. It's good fun and he learns a lot of important fundamentals.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that he constantly taps on anything and everything - including Mail, Settings, etc. The parental controls allow me to easily turn off most apps, but not everything. It also leaves settings for 3rd party apps available in the Settings app even if 3rd party apps are disabled.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is an edge case, but before letting him play with it, I'd really like to be able to disable everything that can destroy data or cause anything to be sent (like an SMS or an accidental 911 dialing or sending an email). As it is now, there's probably a minimum effective age of around 1.75 years for an iPhone OS device because I can't disable all potentially destructive things so they can explore and learn safely on their own. Prior to being old enough to understand what they are doing, I can't explain to them what is going wrong and what they need to avoid doing in order to use the device properly because they don't understand yet.\r\n\r\nAt his present age, I can just turn on the passcode lock and prevent him from doing anything at all, because he doesn't really understand that stuff yet anyway. But in a couple of months, I'd like to be able to let him have the power of opening a simple drawing app with a touch and painting a picture. Unfortunately, I can't lock it down enough to let him learn this process safely on his own terms. The curve from no access to full access is pretty smooth except at the very start, where there's a large vertical jump just after \"no access\".\r\n\r\nThe amazing thing about iPhoneOS is that it's visceral. Even toddlers understand it and get it. It's very remarkable. I'm just disappointed that I can't let him play with one without fretting over him the whole time lest he accidentally send gibberish to my boss."
