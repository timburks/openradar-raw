    description: "16-Apr-2010 10:04 AM Jens Baumeister:\r\nSummary:\r\nSetting an event location can lead to a photo being listed under two different places at once in the places list. If the event location was set by accident, most users will try to correct the issue by editing the photos' locations, unaware that they should edit the event's location to rectify the error. There should be an indicator in the location dialogue for the photo to let users now that a location has already been set via the event.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Get info on an iPhoto event and set a location, e.g. Istanbul\r\n2. Open the event\r\n3. Get info on a photo within the event, and set its location to a different place, e.g. Cupertino\r\n4. Go to Places\r\n5. Switch to browser view if necessary\r\n6. You can find the photo listed under both Istanbul and Cupertino\r\n7. Get info on the photo again and delete the Cupertino location info\r\n8. Now the photo is only listed under Istanbul\r\n9. Get info on the photo and try deleting the Istanbul info.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThere should be an error message or indicator telling you the info is only editable via the event location.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe dialogue behaves like you can delete the info, however it simply reverts back to the event location after pressing OK without telling the user why it's doing so or where the location comes from. For users who are unaware that the event location has been set, it looks like there is an a wrong location in the photo info that cannot be deleted. Nothing points them towards the event location as a solution.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue has been cropping up on the support forums several times, and even many power users couldn't figure it out at first."
