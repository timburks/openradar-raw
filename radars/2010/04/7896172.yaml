    description: "22-Apr-2010 10:50 PM Hamish Allan:\r\n-[UIAlertView addTextFieldWithValue:label:] should be public API.\r\n\r\nBecause Apple use alert views as text field dialogs (e.g. for iTunes or WiFi network password entry), others such as myself are also using them this way. Apparently this is VERY VERY BAD:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/Xcode-users/2010/Apr/msg00314.html\r\n\r\n(so passioned was Luke's response so that I almost classified this enhancement request as a \"serious bug\"!)\r\n\r\nDo you really want everyone to re-implement their own version of alert views? It's either that or we add subviews and risk the breakage Luke describes... unless you expose the API. Please, do the right thing!"
