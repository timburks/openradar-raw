    description: "Regarding https://devforums.apple.com/message/2802 and http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-sms-uri\r\n\r\nMy current application would like to inform a friend of the user about something (a picture) he just discovered in the app. For that, we \"prepare\" and E-mail by launching the Mail App and we'd like to do the same with the SMS App.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I don't even need to put the recipients, as the user will do so itself. I prepare the \"body\" (and for the email, the subject).\r\n\r\nProblem: The \"sms:+1234\" schema only works with a recipient. If I do \"sms:+1234?body=my-text\" It will launch the SMS App but would not start composing a new message.\r\n\r\nFurther more, the \"+\" is required, which does not make sense. I should be able to do \"sms:1234\" as pretty much nobody will enter the international code. In my case, once again, since I don't use the recipient, it's not a big deal."
