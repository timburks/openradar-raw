    description: "I have installed the 4.0 Beta on my 2nd Gen. iPod touch.\r\nI did a little bit of reorganisation with Apps/Icons: \r\n\r\n- Deleted some apps & Moved Icons (Nothing new in 4.0)\r\n- Made some folders, some also in the dock.\r\n\r\nThen I went to the App Store App (on the phone) and did \"Update all\" - entered my iTunes password, told me an app (which one? no idea...) is only for 17, blah blah, ... \r\n\r\nI then let it install/download, and started an App (WhereTo), which I know is crashing in 4.0 right now (the dev. told me - but many apps crash in 4.0 right now so it's nothing rare) but I'm pretty sure it's unrelated to the bug.\r\n\r\nWhen the app crashed, the screen stayed black. The Status Bar on top with the time was there, but no icons, no Dock. I then plugged the iPod on it's Dock to charge and went to bed.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up this morning, the iPod asked me my iTunes password (although it was still black - no icons) and kept on doing so, so I couldn't do anything... Trying to restart it the \"nice\" way wouldn't work, since the UIAlert asking for my password wouldn't let me slide the \"Slide to restart\"...\r\n\r\nSo I rebooted the \"hard way\" (pressing longer), the Apple logo came, it took forever to start (which probably mean it did a bunch of cleanup tasks) and when the Icons arrived, all was reset!!! I mean, apps I deleted where back, all my Folders wheren't there anymore, and so on...\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how I can help you guys reproduce this, but I'm hoping my bug is a duplicate (or some others will be a duplicate of mine) so we can track it down.\r\n\r\nBTW let me me congratulate you guys for 4.0 - this is pretty cool stuff, for both users but especially for us developers! I'm busy with a radio app (so multi task #1 is great!) and another app which will use local notifications!"
