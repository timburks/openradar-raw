    description: "Summary: \r\nThe \"Network Lost\" alert is really annoying.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Live in a small country which has a lot of near neighbors, for example, Switzerland\r\n2. Be a customer of a carrier with poor cellular network coverage, for example, Orange\r\n3. Do *not* choose automatic carrier, because you do not want your iPhone to automatically switch to a foreign network without notice\r\n4. Move from your bedroom to your living room\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe network is lost during the move from your bedroom to your living room (because your carrier coverage sucks). iPhone OS notices that the network is lost and automatically tries to reconnect to the network, *without bothering me*.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe network is lost during the move from your bedroom to your living room (because your carrier coverage sucks). iPhone OS notices that the network is lost and automatically tries to reconnect to the network, also displaying a modal alert: \"Network Lost\" 'Your selected cellular network is no longer available. You can choose a different network in Settings.' (Dismiss) (Settings).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis annoying behavior has been observed from iPhone OS 2.0 to 3.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEvery time I get this alert (from five to twenty times a day), I tap on the 'Dismiss' button. The only time I tapped on the 'Settings' button was because I tapped the wrong button, what I meant was DISMISS! Given that my iPhone is about one and a half year old, it means I have tapped the 'Dismiss' button more than 5000 times, I think this deserves a UISwitch somewhere in the preferences to turn this alert off."
