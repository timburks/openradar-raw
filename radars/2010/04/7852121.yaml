    description: "12-Apr-2010 09:04 AM:\r\nSummary:\r\nAn extra category for multitasking is needed to create multitasking IM-style-apps.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAfter reading the multitasking reference, I came away with the impression that only apps that fall under the category of audio streaming, location or VoIP are actually allowed to *run* in the background. Anything else just gets suspended.   Where does that leave instant messenger style apps that don't have access to a backend server to facilitate push notifications?\r\n \r\nMy app's networking code is based around a REST API that needs a heartbeat request every few minutes to display the user is still \"online\". What I'd need is a VoIP-Style wakeup for the app every few minutes, make a small http request and sleep again. (With a wakeup when the request returns).\r\n\r\nI know this will drain battery, so a usage pattern like \"keep me 15 minutes logged in after leaving the app\" would be useful. But it's the same problem that Skype will have, so THAT shoudn't be an issue.\r\n\r\nI think there are many applications, like mine, that require a persistent connection to a server to provide chat service. For many of these apps, mine included, it is not feasible to create a solution based on push notifications (else I would have done so) because the server providing the IM service is not under the app creator's control. In order to support a push notification solution, I would have to write, host and maintain a server infrastructure to communicate with the IM service - that would need to support up to tens of thousands of users - and then rewrite my entire app to communicate with said infrastructure using web services. This costs time, money and effort, and in some cases, mine specifically, is prohibited by the terms of use enforced by the service provider.   All of this could be negated by adding a single extra multitasking type that covers instant messenger applications."
