    description: "10-Apr-2010 02:43 PM Thomas Worrall:\r\nAs well as the seven types of multitasking introduced in the iPhone OS 4.0 beta, I would like to request one more: \"Background Network Service\".\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, this enables an application to be backgrounded while still maintaining an open network connection, such as an SSH client or an IRC client.\r\n\r\nThe new mode should also allow three options:\r\n\r\n1. Get woken (briefly) for any data received on the network connection. In the case of the IRC client, the app developer would enable this option, and when any text was sent would cache it for future display. He could also scan the incoming text for keywords and present a notification if the user's name was present, for example.\r\n\r\n2. Get woken (briefly) periodically to perform a keepalive type function.\r\n\r\n3. Get woken on incoming connection request (such as via bonjour). This would facilitate apps that had device-to-device synchronisation, for example, without both users having to have the app in the foreground."
