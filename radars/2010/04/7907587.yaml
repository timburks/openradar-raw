    description: "The iPhone is a single-person device. An iPad, however, is likely to be a shared family device. It sits on the coffee table. The kids want to use it to look something up, or play a game, or check email.\r\n\r\nGiven these different usage models, it would be great if the iPad supported multiple user profiles, each with their own settings, apps, screen layouts, and tied into their own iTunes accounts. This way, I can hand off my iPad to my son without worrying that he's going to rearrange my icons or get into my email.\r\n\r\nA simple login screen with a human-friendly password mechanism that is operable by small kids (my 4-y.o. is an active user of paint programs and cameras on my iPhone) and does not rely on knowledge of the alphabet or keyboarding would be ideal.\r\n\r\nA \"master\"  account would also be be needed to allow for password resets and setting of parental controls, but much of this could be done via iTunes."
