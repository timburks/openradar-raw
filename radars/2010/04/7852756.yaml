    description: "There are many apps which must refresh data before being useful. This means routine usage for \"checking in\" can be to:\r\n1. Launch an app.\r\n2. Wait while it fetches any new data.\r\n3. Read the updates (if any).\r\n4. Launch another app.\r\n5. Wait more.\r\n6. Read.\r\nLather, rinse, repeat.\r\n\r\nOften such apps don't support push notifications are would not be appropriate to use for push (Twitter, RSS, weather, newspaper apps, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe iPhone/iPad should have a way to trigger background updates, perhaps configured through the Clock app and a special alarm type, for one or more apps.\r\n\r\nI might set it to fetch everything at 7am and 5:15pm, so it would have the latest when I wake up and before I leave for home..."
