    description: "To see photos by the 'Faces' tab I currently need to sync _all_ photos of the people I wish to appear in Faces. This is a broken concept since my iPhoto library contains many thousand photos and my iPad is not intended for that same volume.\r\nCurrently I would have to add all family members under 'Faces' when sync'ing in order to be able to see them in the 'Faces' tab of the Photo app. In my case this adds many thousands of images - plus it gives me sporadic images from events/places that I did not intend to add, but were added as a consequence of adding the many thousand face images.\r\n\r\nIn comparison the 'Places' tab works different - and works perfect: any photo with location info is viewable on the map at that location.\r\nThe same should definitely be true for 'Faces'. Any photo on the iPad containing Alice should be categorized under Alice in the 'Faces' tab.\r\n\r\nIf the current 'faces' paradigm was applied to 'places' it would mean that I would have to add all images from New York in order to view any images from New York on the map. Just doesn't make sense."
