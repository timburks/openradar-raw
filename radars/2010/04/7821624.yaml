    description: "02-Apr-2010 09:02 AM Daniel Dickison:\r\n'Screenshots.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n02-Apr-2010 09:02 AM Daniel Dickison:\r\nSummary:\r\nI have 2 Weather widgets open in Dashboard, positioned vertically.  Sometimes when I open Dashboard, one or more of the widgets will have moved vertically so that they are overlapping on top of each other.\r\n\r\nI'm using a 13\" MacBook Pro, with an external 24\" monitor arranged vertically.  The external monitor is configured as the main screen (with menu bar).  The widgets are positioned on the external monitor when it is connected. (See screenshots.)\r\n\r\nI'm frequently connecting and disconnecting the external display.  It's possible that the widget dance only happens after I connect or disconnect the display, perhaps also with a sleep/wake cycle in between.  However, I'm not able to reliably reproduce the behavior (even doing a `killall Dock' in between), but it seems to happen once every couple of days.  I use the computer every day.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an external display, make it the main display and arrange it vertically (see attachment).\r\n2. Open Dashboard and arrange two weather widgets vertically on the external display.\r\n3. Go about your business for a day or two, connecting and disconnecting the display.\r\n4. Open Dashboard.\r\n\r\nExpected: The Weather widgets are arranged vertically (see attachment).\r\nActual: Sometimes the widgets are overlapping (see attachment)."
