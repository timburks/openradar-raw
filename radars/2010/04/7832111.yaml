    description: "Summary: When creating a tab bar controller (either through IB or from code) and setting a UITabBarItem to be disabled. The item is not drawn as disabled until its enabled state is flipped back and forth. The item still works as expected though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a new Tab Bar project.\r\n- Choose the second TabBarItem and set its state to disabled\r\n- Run the project and note the tab bar item is drawn as enabled, but is not clickable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTab bar item would draw as disabled based on the initial state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTab bar item is drawn incorrectly\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
