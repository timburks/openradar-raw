    description: "09-Apr-2010 10:20 AM Emanuele Vulcano:\r\nOn April 9th, 2010, section 3.3.1 of the Agreement was changed to forbid use of languages and translation tools other than Apple's. This is unprecedented, overreaching, and actively prevents me from performing the following activities:\r\n\r\n• Porting software originally designed for other platforms, or designed for cross-platform use, to iPhone OS (such as, say, software produced using Unity 3D [1]).\r\n• Using rapid development tools to reduce very large projects to feasibility (eg. not having to code a game engine despite having a good idea for a game, by using a middleware tool such as Unity 3D).\r\n• Porting network software originally designed for iPhone OS to other platforms, thereby increasing its desirability and App Store sales.\r\n\r\nPlease revise that clause ASAP to remove this problem. Thank you."
