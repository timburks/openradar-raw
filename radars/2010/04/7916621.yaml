    description: "Foreword:\r\n\r\nI've selected the product \"iPad\" because this issue happened to me on this platform, but it applies to iPhone as well. While I classified this as a UI/Usability issue, it actually led to data loss in my case. I didn't report it as such because I didn't have a crash log or anything else to attach to this bug report.\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nIn case of low memory, Mobile Safari purges unused tabs from memory. This may lead to loss of data if data was entered in the purged document or if the document resulted from a HTTP POST request.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.) Open a web page with a form that allows data input in Mobile Safari\r\n2.) Enter data in the form\r\n3.) Open other tabs or perform memory-intensive tasks in other applications\r\n4.) Open the original tab again, which Mobile Safari will reload\r\n5.) Entered content is lost\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMobile Safari should behave more intelligently about the order in which it purges unused tabs. Those with entered data and those which resulted from a POST request should take precedence over tabs which resulted from a simple GET request and not had any data entered.\r\n\r\nIdeally, Safari would even cache tabs which are in danger of data loss persistently so as to avoid this frustrating behaviour completely.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe contents I entered in the form were lost completely, eliminating about half an hour of my work. Using the iPad as a desktop replacement for non-development tasks, I didn't even think about the possibility of this issue and less tech-savvy users might be even more surprised about this behaviour.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nShould occur on every possible combination of iPhone-OS-capable hardware and every version of iPhone OS, but I've only witnessed it on an iPad 16GB WiFi running iPhone OS 3.2"
