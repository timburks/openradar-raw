    description: "23-Apr-2010 03:22 PM Arash Payan:\r\n*Summary*\r\nAs noted on the Apple support site (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3647), the iPad does not support the Bluetooth Hands Free Profile. Many of our app users (Line2, www.line2.com) have requested the ability to use a bluetooth headset with their iPad while making calls, and HFP is necessary to make this happen.\r\n\r\n*Steps to Reproduce*\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n*Expected Results*\r\nTo be able to use a bluetooth headset for VoIP calls on the iPad\r\n\r\n*Actual Results*\r\nYou are not able to use a bluetooth headset, you have to use the Apple supplied earbuds\r\n\r\n*Regression*\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n*Notes*\r\nIt would be good if this enabled on the iPod touch line as well."
