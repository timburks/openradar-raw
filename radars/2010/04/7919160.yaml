    description: "Using the Apple keyboard dock, some unix-style control key commands do work, namely:\r\n\r\nControl-A: move cursor to beginning of line (same as control-left arrow)\r\nControl-E: move cursor to end of line (same as control-right arrow)\r\nControl-F: move cursor forward (same as right arrow)\r\nControl-F: move cursor backward (same as left arrow)\r\nControl-K: kill line\r\nControl-H: delete backwards (same as delete key)\r\n\r\nYay! Except some equally useful commands don't, viz.:\r\n\r\nControl-N: Move cursor down a line (same as down arrow)\r\nControl-P: Move cursor up a line (same as up arrow)\r\nControl-D: delete forward\r\nControl-Y: Insert previously killed line(s)\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nAt least N and P should work if F and B do. Not having D and Y is irritating, but not the end of the world."
