    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connected to a SMB share hosted by a Linux server using Samba version 3, user can not successfully write files to the share using drag and drop in the Finder. The same user can successfully use Terminal.app to move or copy those same files to the share.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n[Need Linux based server hosting a file share via SMB. Permissions to files and folders are controlled via ACL. User has an account with permissions to read and write files to that share or a specific subdirectory.]\r\n1. Connect to the share, authenticate and mount the share.\r\n2. Open a Finder window with view of share.\r\n3. In the Finder, attempt to copy a file (file type does not matter) via drag and drop method from the Desktop to share.\r\n\r\nThe file, as user has read/write access, should successfully copy to the share, but it does not. The Finder cursor displays a prohibitory sign.\r\n\r\n4. With server connection still active, open Terminal.app\r\n5. In Terminal.app, use the cp command to copy that same file from the Desktop to the share.\r\n > cp /Path/To/File /Path/To/Server/\r\n\r\nThe file should copy successfully.\r\n\r\nAs exhibited by using Terminal.app, the user does have proper access to the share, but the Finder is misinterpreting those permissions and preventing proper use.\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n- Files that already exist on the share can be properly edited in their appropriate applications and all changes are saved.\r\n- If a new directory is created on the share and you attempt to drag and drop copy files from the Finder to the new directory, Finder errors with a -36 error."
