    description: "21-Nov-2009 04:04 PM Alexander Strange:\r\n'asmbook.spx' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n21-Nov-2009 04:04 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOSStatus is typedefed to 'long' on 32-bit and 'int' on 64-bit. This means no one printf format can be used for it, without -Wformat complaining. It is perfectly justified to do this - OSStatus should just be 'int' no matter what.\r\n\r\nIf it's impossible to change this - I assume it must be, or it already would have been changed, so maybe it changes C++ mangling - maybe the compilers could just be made to ignore pointless type changing like this.\r\n\r\nUsing:\r\n#include <Carbon/Carbon.h>\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nvoid print_x(OSStatus err)\r\n{\r\n        printf(\"%x\\n\", err);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid print_lx(OSStatus err)\r\n{\r\n        printf(\"%lx\\n\", err);\r\n}\r\n\r\n> gcc -arch i386 -Wall -S OSStatus.c\r\nOSStatus.c: In function ‘print_x’:\r\nOSStatus.c:6: warning: format ‘%x’ expects type ‘unsigned int’, but argument 2 has type ‘OSStatus’\r\n> gcc -arch x86_64 -Wall -S OSStatus.c\r\nOSStatus.c: In function ‘print_lx’:\r\nOSStatus.c:11: warning: format ‘%lx’ expects type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 2 has type ‘OSStatus’"
