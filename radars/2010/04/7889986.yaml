    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSince installing the Xcode included with the second beta of iPhone OS 4.0, I've been unable to pull device data from any iPhone OS device attached to this computer. It all worked fine before this beta. This includes any of about a half dozen devices (iPhones, iPods touch, and iPads), running 3.0, 3.1.3, 3.2, and 4.0b2. This also affects separate installations of previous SDKs on the same machine.\r\n\r\nHooking the device up to a different machine enables me to extract the data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nConnect an iPhone OS device, open the Organizer, and attempt to copy data from an installed Debug application. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould see a disclosure triangle. Clicking it should reveal \"Application Data\" for copying.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe disclosure triangles are not present, and no \"Application Data\" 'package' is available.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nConnect the same device to a machine running an older version of Xcode, and it behaves as expected."
