    description: "22-Apr-2010 04:05 PM Hamish Allan:\r\n'OTCenteringScrollViewTest.zip' was successfully uploaded [see http://bitbucket.org/hatfinch/otcenteringscrollviewtest]\r\n\r\n22-Apr-2010 04:05 PM Hamish Allan:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe enclosed project is a minimal test case for a class called OTCenteringScrollView, a UIScrollView subclass which is designed to keep its content view centred (like the Photos app does).\r\n\r\nIt works perfectly in the simulator, but when zooming on the device the view skitters all over the shop.\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be that calling -setContentInset: from within -setContentSize: provokes this chaotic behaviour. If you comment out line 69 in OTCenteringScrollView.m (the call to -setContentInset:), the incorrect behaviour ceases (but of course the content insets are wrong). However, it doesn't appear to be setting the content offset directly, as you can observe by uncommenting the NSLog statements at lines 70 and 73.\r\n\r\nI can only conclude that there is a bug in UIScrollView which either exists in differences between the simulator and device code, or only manifests itself as a result of interactions that don't exist in the simulator (such as the centre-point of a pinch changing during the pinch).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the enclosed project on the simulator. Observe expected behaviour.\r\nRun the project on the device. Keep zooming into the centre of the image using inverted pinch gestures until the image jumps around chaotically.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAs per simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nImage jumps around chaotically.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDon't know. I'm only overriding methods that were available since the first public SDK.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease eat your own dogfood and re-implement the Photos app using UIScrollView.\r\n\r\n\r\n22-Apr-2010 04:17 PM Hamish Allan:\r\nTo clarify:\r\n\r\nI said \"I'm only overriding methods that were available since the first public SDK.\"\r\n\r\nI am actually also overriding -zoomToRect:animated: in the code submitted, but this has no bearing on the bug -- please feel free to comment it out. In fact you can comment everything out except the -initWithFrame:, -addSubview: and -setContentSize: overrides and still see the bug manifest itself."
