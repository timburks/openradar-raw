    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an Open Directory Master and add some users and groups to it.\r\n2) In Server Admin, the mail service, go to Settings, and then Mailing Lists.\r\n3) Check the box  for \"Enable server group mailing lists\"\r\n4) Click on Save\r\n5) Wait at least as long as it says in the \"Update recipient list every\" box (or longer)\r\n6) Configure a client system to connect to the mail server as one of the users in step 1\r\n7) Send a message to one of the groups i.e. groupname@server.domain.com\r\n8) The server will respond that it can't send to that address\r\n9) If you configure an address in the Mail service, General, Copy undeliverable mail to: field, the mail sent to the group will be received by the catch all account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEvery member of the OD group that has mail enabled for them should receive the message.  This was the result in 10.5.x servers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe members of the group don't get any mail sent to the group address.  Messages sent to the group address are either forwarded to the undeliverable address or denied.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem has been around since at least the shipping version of 10.6.0 server.  Same problem on 10.6.1 and 10.6.2.  Have tried it on many different installs, on different hardware for server and clients. \r\n\r\nNotes:"
