    description: "06-Apr-2010 09:02 AM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Developer Tools package installs a 1.5GB /Developer/Documentation. Since HTML is highly compressible, it's easy to save 50% of that disk space:\r\n\r\nroot@/Developer> ditto --hfsCompression Documentation Documentation_\r\nroot@/Developer> du -sh Documentation*\r\n1.5G\tDocumentation\r\n787M\tDocumentation_\r\n\r\nBut currently only the base system files are compressed during installation, so this doesn't happen. It would be nice if it did."
