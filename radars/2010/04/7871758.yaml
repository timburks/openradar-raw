    description: "16-Apr-2010 10:31 AM Jens Baumeister:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Pakistan government decided not to oberserve DST in 2010 on March 26th, 2010. Not surprisingly, this change didn't make it into OS X in time. As a result, Pakistan Mac users get a time that's one hour off (GMT+6 instead of the correct GMT+5) when using the Mac's automatc time setting features.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to the Date/Time control panel and set the location to somewhere in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe time zone should be GMT+5\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe time zone is GMT+6\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNews article about time zone change: \r\nhttp://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/pakistan-dst-start-2010.html"
