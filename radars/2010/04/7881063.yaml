    description: "Summary:\r\nMobile Safari's feature to ask if you want to store the login information for a site, does not work with types of browser authentication that present a alert box type of UI asking you to enter your username and password (such as Basic authentication)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit a site that uses this type of login/authentication (or create a test one by securing a web accessible folder using htaccess), enter your information and continue on with the login.\r\nUnlike a standard web-form based login, you will Not be asked if \"you want to save this password\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSites using basic authentication login systems (and other types that produce the alert-type login box) should trigger the same \"save this password\" systems that is called for standard web forms.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are unable to save your login information on sites using this authentication method and therefore must manually type out the username and password each time, as well as confusing the user as to why they were not asked on \"this site\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
