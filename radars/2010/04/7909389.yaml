    description: "on a nightly basis we have our build server run a docset build that generates a rss feed and xar'd docset for updating in the xcode documentation viewer.   I've been unable to get Xcode to accept our self-signed certificate  so that we don't get prompted every time the documentation gets updated (daily).\r\n\r\ni have gotten it to the point where this gets logged to console when i try to update:\r\n4/26/10 5:57:32 PM\tcom.apple.docsetinstalld[7789]\tArchive signature validated, but the certificate is not trusted\r\n\r\nthis says to me that, yes, the signature in the archive is valid based on the code signing identity used as compared to the locally installed key/certificate; but that since i'm not on some list of trusted CSI's that the docset can't be installed.\r\n\r\nis it just self-signed certificates that aren't accepted or is the auto-install/no-prompt install reserved for apple docsets?  I will file subsequent enhancement request if the feature is limited to apple."
