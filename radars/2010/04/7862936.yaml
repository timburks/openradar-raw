    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere is no \"fake\" version of iPod.app in the iPhone Simulator, as there is with Photos.app. The absence of this app makes it impossible to test a number of things within the MediaPlayer framework without actually using a device. It would be terrific if, much like Photos, there could be a fake iPod with a few basic tracks for testing purposes."
