    description: "Summary: \r\nThe date of WWDC 2010 has not been announced to developers or the public.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari on a device with a working Internet connection\r\n2. Check http://developer.apple.com/wwdc\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNow that it is April 20, 2010, I expected news about the 2010 version of WWDC, perhaps venue, hotel rates, sessions, and ancillary events, but most especially the start and end dates. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly information from the preceding version (2009) of WWDC is presented.  \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo previous version of WWDC has been this tardy.  As of April 20, 2010, the Apple Developer site always reports about the 2009 version of WWDC. Attempted on the iPhone 3G 16GB, the iPad 64GB, the MacBook Pro, the Mac Pro, and the Power Mac G5DP2.7. This issue appears to be independent of client hardware, browser, and OS. \r\n\r\nVersions of WWDC prior to 2009 have always been announced at least twelve weeks before the conference, sometimes even longer:\r\n\r\nWWDC 2003 announced Feb 10 to start May 19\r\nWWDC 2004 announced Feb 26 to start June 28\r\nWWDC 2005 announced Feb 15 to start June 6\r\nWWDC 2006 announced March 7 to start Aug 7 \r\nWWDC 2007 announced Feb 6 to start June 11\r\nWWDC 2008 announced March 13 to start June 9 \r\n\r\nOnly version 2009 broke that pattern, announcing March 26, which is still weeks earlier than any announcement about version 2010.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo workaround known, except perhaps for resurrecting the MacHack conference. San Francisco hotel rates go up quite fast with decreasing lead times, so WWDC becomes a very expensive trip if the dates are left undocumented for too long.  If Apple's \"no shows\"-policy does not apply to WWDC, I would suggest adding, at minimum, a feature of version 2007: a \"Save the Date\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated: #7885969\r\n\r\nApril 21: Rejected; Use http://developer.apple.com/contact/ \r\n\r\nResolved on April 28: WWDC starts June 7 in Moscone West. \r\nShortest lead time ever: 6 weeks 5 days"
