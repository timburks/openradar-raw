    description: "Hi! I am a shiny new user of your lovely iPad device. I have been hesitant to get into iDevices until now for reasons mostly to do with my strong dislike of iTunes, but thought I would give the iPad a shot to see if it would be a fine computer replacement for my mother.\r\n\r\nIn my initial use of the device, I notice that it continues to use the \"auto-lock\" functionality, as well as the \"slide to unlock\" functionality. While this was a fine way to demonstrate the technical capabilities of the slide switch back in the day, it is rapidly becoming hugely annoying. As a larger device, the iPad is often left laying on a couch or table. I may use it briefly, go back to what I was doing, then want to use it again. Each time, I am forced to \"slide to unlock\" the device because â€¦ why exactly? It hasn't been in my pocket or a bag, or anywhere else that it could have been \"accidentally\" unlocked. It wouldn't be so bad if display sleep was divorced from the \"auto lock\" functionality, but as far as I can tell, setting \"auto lock\" to never is the equivalent to setting \"eat battery\" to \"faster\". Do you like my use of \"scare quotes\"?\r\n\r\nThere is so much going on it to prevent accidental data input that the whole slide to unlock thing just seems like a monumental waste of time. It seems that even in the case of a device that does end up in a pocket or bag all the time, the chances of said pocket or bag being able to hit the home button, then managing to capacitively touch key areas on the display enough to cause problems seems vanishingly small. If that were the case, then the hypothetical capacitive-touch capable contents of a pocket or bag should certainly also be able to slide to unlock, which means that that feature offers no benefit in any case aside from annoying me enough to cause me to waste my time to file a bug report that is sure to be duped against one I won't be able to see the resolution of anyway. Can you tell that I file too many of these?\r\n\r\nPerhaps if the user force-locked the device with the power key, then it could have an unlock feature. But trying to guess the users intention and getting it wrong the majority of the time in what seems to me to be a fairly common usage mode is annoying at best and insulting at worst. Please help me save my sanity.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering!"
