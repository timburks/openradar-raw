    description: "With JPG data,\r\n\r\nif:\r\n- An incremental CGImageSource is used,\r\n- it is updated with incomplete data\r\n- then updated with complete data from a direct provider (NOT with CFData)\r\n- then is used to create a CGImage\r\nThen:\r\n- That CGImage will fail to draw into a PDF.\r\n\r\nSample code attached [contact me if you want it].\r\n\r\nTo use the sample code, compile it. Run it under 10.5 and see that it creates a PDF file and opens it. There will be an image in the PDF. This is correct behavior. Run the app under 10.6.x. It will generate a PDF and open it. The PDF will appear to be blank. If you inspect the PDF you will see that the image is present but has no data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in  Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview  Build 11A390."
