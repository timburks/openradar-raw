    description: "Summary:\r\nNSArrayController's selection properties (and possibly others, I haven't checked) do not properly issue NSKeyValueObservingOptionPrior KVO notifications. Only the after-the-fact KVO notifications occur.\r\n\r\nBesides being an issue in itself, this further has the result of breaking +keyPathsAffectingValueOf<key>.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Also attached an example project which isn't very interesting, it's just exactly what you'd expect demonstrating the issue.]"
