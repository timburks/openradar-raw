    description: "Unison 2 (http://www.panic.com/unison/) uses CoreAnimation extensively in its UI: the source list and main content view in the window are layer-hosting views, and everything inside is built from CALayers. During development, I found that if a CATransaction is left open (usually due to an uncaught exception thrown inside a transaction) the entire UI freezes up. (See also radar #6848104.)\r\n\r\nSo far we haven't found any instances of our code leaving the UI wedged like this, but it turns out that resizing the window with a Wacom tablet will occasionally leave a transaction open. I don't think it's in our code because it works fine with a mouse or trackpad, and I'm not seeing any exceptions or warnings in the console.\r\n\r\nHere's an ugly fix using the unpublished [CATransaction currentState] method. In my NSWindow subclass:\r\n\r\n- (void)setFrame:(NSRect)frame display:(BOOL)display\r\n{\r\n\t[super setFrame:frame display:display];\r\n\t\r\n\tif ( [CATransaction currentState] == 2 )\r\n\t\t[CATransaction commit];\r\n}"
