    description: "After reading the multitasking reference, I came away with the impression that only apps that fall under the category of audio streaming, location or VoIP are actually allowed to *run* in the background. Anything else just gets suspended.\r\n \r\nWhere does that leave instant messenger style apps that don't have access to a backend server to facilitate push notifications?\r\n \r\nMy app's networking code is based on CFSockets, which I could rewrite to use higher level APIs in order to take advantage of the multitasking API. However, even if I do that my app will not be allowed to run in the background because it doesn't fall under Audio, VoIP or Location based app.\r\n\r\nI think there are many applications, like mine, that require a persistent connection to a server to provide chat service. For many of these apps, mine included, it is not feasible to create a solution based on push notifications (else I would have done so) because the server providing the IM service is not under the app creator's control. In order to support a push notification solution, I would have to write, host and maintain a server infrastructure to communicate with the IM service - that would need to support up to tens of thousands of users - and then rewrite my entire app to communicate with said infrastructure using web services. This costs time, money and effort, and in some cases, mine specifically, is prohibited by the terms of use enforced by the service provider. \r\n\r\nAll of this could be negated by adding a single extra multitasking type that covers instant messenger applications."
