    description: "20-Apr-2010 05:02 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nIt is April 20, 2010, and dates for WWDC 2010 have not been announced.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Visit http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/\r\n2. Observe that the listed dates are for 2009.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWWDC results would have been announced by now.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApple's developer site still lists dates for 2009.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis represents a major regression, as in prior years WWDC dates have always been announced weeks earlier than today's date.  For example:\r\n\r\n2009: March 27\r\n2008: March 14\r\n2007: February 6\r\n2006: March 23\r\n2005: March 30\r\n2004: March 15\r\n2003: February 20, with new WWDC date/location announced March 21.\r\n\r\nNote that in 2006 WWDC was held unusually late in the year, August 7-11, even though WWDC dates are typically in June.  The dates were nevertheless announced before the end of March.  For 2010 it's now nearly a month after the date of the 2006 announcement, but dates have not yet been announced.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nMany Mac and iPhone developers enjoy taking vacations in the northern hemisphere's summer.  WWDC is important enough to many of them that they will schedule these vacations so as not to conflict with WWDC.  The delay in announcing dates is causing a related problem in that it makes it difficult for developers to plan their lives over the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n21-Apr-2010 10:52 AM [name deleted] :\r\nThank you for reporting this issue.
