    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the iPhone's connection fails while it's checking mail, a \"Cannot get mail\" alert appears, for each account that failed. If 5 out of your 6 email accounts fail, you get 5 alerts, in progression. There's no way to skip these. Sometimes, it will display 2 alerts for each account, meaning I'll get 10 or 12 popups in a row. It can take a minute or more to dismiss them all, since they appear in sequence.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should be condensed into one popup, or better yet, some small status bar or other non-modal view in the app somewhere."
