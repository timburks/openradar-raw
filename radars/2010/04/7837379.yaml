    description: "Video embedded in web pages displayed with a UIWebView housed by a modal UIViewController, when made full screen, appears *behind* the modal web view!\r\n\r\nTo replicate this, run the attached project on a device.\r\nTap the button to bring up a modal browser view.\r\nPlay the embedded youtube video and tap the expand button so it would fill the screen.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that the media player's modal view appears to conflict with the modal view that is already present. It ends up being displayed behind it instead of above it. This is most easily visible in landscape since you see the side of the video clipped by the modal view (see included screenshot).\r\n\r\nObviously I would expect the video to fill the screen above everything else - even other modal views."
