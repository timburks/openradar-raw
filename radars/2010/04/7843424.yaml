    description: "See bug 7839823 for further details on the change in behavior (marked \"behaves correctly\") which prompted this request.\r\n\r\nWhen backing up with TimeMachine to a volume which contains other data, it may be desirable to limit the amount of space that is allocated to TimeMachine.  Under OS X versions prior to 10.6.3 this could be accomplished by creating a sparsebundle of a specified size.  Under 10.6.3 TimeMachine checks to see that the sparsebundle is sized equal to the containing volume and resizes it to this size if it is smaller.  This resizing behavior defeats the constraints defined by the set size.  It is understandable that under normal conditions this resizing behavior is beneficial, for example if the sparsebundle is moved to a larger drive.\r\n\r\nAn effective alternative to the sparsebundle workaround would be a sanctioned TimeMachine preference to limit the disk space taken up by backups.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently a \"defaults\" preference ( /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MaxSize ), but this doesn't seem to be functional and likely wouldn't be a reliable option anyway."
