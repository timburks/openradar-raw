    description: "Summary:\r\nHTTPs identity certificates still visible in Safari on iPhone OS after the profile was deleted in Settings\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an identity/client certificate for HTTPs client side authentication in the list of profiles on the iPhone (screenshot, step 1) and use it for authentication in Safari.\r\n2. Delete the certificate, f.e. because it was revoked or expired (screenshot step 2)\r\n3. Go to the authenticated page in Safari again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Profile/certificate gone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Identity is still offered along with an \"iPCUHost-...\" certificate in Safari\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- iPhone OS 3.1.3\r\n- seen on two 3G devices\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The client certificate that cannot be removed now was installed about a year ago.\r\n- Restarting the iPhone doesn't help. Resetting the iPhone from iTunes with applying the backup doesn't help.\r\n- Certificates also don't show up in the iPhone Configuration Utility anymore.\r\n- I removed the certificate because it was expired. I installed a new certificate immediately, Safari offered my three choices then: old identity, new identity, iPCUHost. I deleted all custom profiles then, as mentioned in steps to reproduce, leaving me with two choices in Safari: old identity, iPCUHost. Maybe the installation of another certificate with the same name is somehow relevant.\r\n- Same setup works without a problem in Safari + Keychain on Mac OS X, so the certificates are correct."
