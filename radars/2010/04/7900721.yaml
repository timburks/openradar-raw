    description: "23-Apr-2010 01:19 PM Cody Brimhall:\r\nSummary:\r\niPhone OS needs a feature to allow user-installed keyboard layouts. This is especially true for iPad, where users may want to do serious text editing that requires the use of special character sets, such as the International Phonetic Alphabet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn an iPhone OS device, use the web browser to download a keylayout file (e.g. http://somuchwit.com/wp-content/uploads/misc/iPhone_test.keylayout). Alternatively, receive a keylayout file as an email attachment and attempt to open it with the email app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpon loading the keylayout file in MobileSafari.app or MobileMail.app, the user should be asked if she wants to install the keyboard layout. If she chooses yes, then the keyboard layout file should be installed, and the new layout should be accessible by e.g. activating it in the \"International > Keyboards\" section of the system settings app. The keyboard layout should then be accessible to the user by using e.g. the same button on the system keyboard that is already used to cycle through Apple-supplied keyboards.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen MobileSafari.app is asked to download a keylayout file, it just displays the XML contents of the file. When MobileMail.app is asked to open a keylayout attachment, it throws up an error message saying it can't.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI described in \"Expected Results\" how the feature ought to work. I assume that it would not actually be possible to install keylayout files designed for Mac OS X in any event, but there should be some way for users to craft keylayout files specifically for the iPad/iPhone keyboard, such that the normal QWERTY keyboard values are replaced with user-defined ones. More complex input mechanisms, such as the \"finger painting\" input method for Chinese characters, would of course not be possible using this method. I just want to be able to type in the IPA!"
