    description: "Currently, to test the \"external display\" feature of the iPad, I need to use hardware, but can't attach to the computer for debugging at the same time.\r\n\r\nI would love to be able to somehow have an \"external display\" in the Simulator. Whether it requires an actual external display attached to the computer, or it's just a window, it will be incredibly useful for development, and save me a lot of time. Currently, I have to attach the device to the computer, build and install, detach, plug in the display, run the app with the display connected. Rinse and repeat. The only way to debug is by grabbing crash reports from the Organizer after the fact."
