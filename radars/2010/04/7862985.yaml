    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen populating a UIActionSheet using addButtonWithTitle:, if you add more buttons than the screen height allows, causing the action sheet to switch from buttons to an embedded table view, the action sheet behaves incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new iPhone project in Xcode using the \"View-Based Application\" template. Create a button in Interface Builder and attach it to a method called \"showActionSheet:\" in the pre-generated view controller. \r\n\r\nIn the showActionSheet: method create an NSArray and populate it with at least 7 strings. \r\n\r\nInit a UIActionSheet with the following parameters: initWithTitle:@\"Action Sheet Title\" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@\"Cancel\" destructiveButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:nil. \r\n\r\nPopulate the UIActionSheet by iterating though the array of strings and calling addButtonWithTitle: on the action sheet for each string.\r\n\r\ncall showInView, using the view controller's view property, on the action sheet and release it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn action sheet should slide up from the bottom of the screen, stopping at the status bar; it should have the title of \"Action Sheet title\" at the top followed by an embedded UITableView filled with rows named after the items in the array used to populate it, followed by a UIButton with a title of \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the action sheet slides up, it extends past the top of the screen, obscuring the title; there is an extra row inserted at the top of the UITableView with a title of \"Cancel\", causing the last element of the array to not be displayed and the actual Cancel button is not displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem occurs in iPhone OS 3.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a sample project with examples of the desired behavior and variations of the undesired behavior. \r\n\r\nThe \"Show Good Action Sheet\" button, attached to the showCorrectActionSheet: method, demonstrates the desired results, but populates the UIActionSheet with the otherButtonTitles: parameter in its init method, and does not use addButtonWithTitle:.\r\n\r\nThe \"Show Good Action Sheet 2\" button, attached to the showCorrectActionSheet2: method, demonstrates that the bug only occurs when adding enough buttons to cause the action sheet to switch from buttons to an embedded table view\r\n\r\nThe \"Show Bad Action Sheet\" button, attached to the showIncorrectActionSheet: method, demonstrates the bug as described.\r\n\r\nThe \"Show Bad Action Sheet 2\" button, attached to the showIncorrectActionSheet2: method, shows additional side effects of the bug, when using both the otherButtonTitles: parameter in the init method and the addButtonWithTitle: method. Note that the actual cancel button is now present, but there is still an extra \"Cancel\" row in the table view, beneath the buttons added via the otherButtonTitles: parameter."
