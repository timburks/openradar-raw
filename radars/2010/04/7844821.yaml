    description: "Dear Apple,\r\n\r\nI've been a fairly happy iPhone developer, enjoying the great technology you've built. However, in the years since the app store has been introduced, you've added clauses to the agreement that stifle and limit developers. While I didn't like the clause forbidding interpreters, I was able to at least understand it.\r\n\r\nYesterday, you added a new clause to the agreement that effectively forbids the use of other programming languages besides the C family, and of translator tools. Programming languages are tools. Many domain-specific languages help increase the quality of code, prevent bugs, and even support an iPhone-native look and feel.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was not your intention to cause such a broad ban on programming languages, but as your app store reviewers have been known to take the terms and conditions very literally, I do not feel able to continue working on the software I intended to release. Please, revise clause 3.3.1 or release clarifying statements both to the public and your reviewers.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWas told to contact Apple Legal instead."
