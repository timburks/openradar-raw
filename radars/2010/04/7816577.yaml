    description: "Summary:\r\nWorkgroup Manager 10.6.2 (361.2.1) allows entering illegal characters (such as a period) into a users's short name when creating the user. The user info is saved, but results in abnormal behaviour such as not being able to delete the user or intermittent authentication errors.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nCreate a user named \"Firstname Lastname\"\r\nSet \"firstname.lastname\" as the shortname\r\nSet a password\r\nSave the user record\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nWorkgroup Manager should give an error about the user name having illegal characters and not save the user record\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe user data is saved but cannot be deleted or sometimes even modified.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo delete the user, a workaround is to set their password type to \"Crypt Password\" and then delete the user."
