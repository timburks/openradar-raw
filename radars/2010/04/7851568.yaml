    description: "When using an external keyboard on the iPad, many Emacs-style shortcuts are not supported, even though some are.\r\n\r\nNotable missing shortcuts include:\r\n\r\nCtrl-D (forward delete)\r\nCtrl-Y (yank/uncut text after Ctrl-K)\r\nCtrl-P/Ctrl-N (up, down)\r\nCtrl-O (open new line)\r\nCtrl-T (transpose/drag character right)\r\n\r\nBecause these shortcuts are standard on the Mac and are muscle memory for many users, it would be good if the iPad supported them like it did for Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E."
