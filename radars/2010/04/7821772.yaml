    description: "Summary: \r\nIt appears that no Universal apps are showing up under the new \"Top iPad\" categories on the iTunes AppStore. While it is possible that every native iPad application is outselling all iPhone applications, it seems unlikely as the volume of iPhone to iPad owners is vasty different at this time.   \r\n\r\nNot showing these applications in that category can severely impact those developers who made their applications universal. By not showing them in all possible places, owners of iPads will not see these value added universal products in the Top 10/100 lists. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Goto the iTunes AppStore\r\n2. Open the Top 100 Paid iPhone Apps list\r\n3. Find any high-ranking app that shows the Plus (+) symbol to indicate that the application is universal on both iPhone and iPad. In this case I'm looking at Wolfram Alpha which as of today is the #1 top selling iPhone app at this time, and is also universal for iPhone and iPad.\r\n4. Now open the Top Paid 100 iPad Apps list\r\n5. Look for the application(s) you found in #3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to find the top selling universal iPad/iPhone application somewhere on the iPad Top Selling list. Maybe not #1, but I expect it to be somewhere in the top 100.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI don't find it anywhere in the top 100. Not #1, not #100. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI can reproduce this with any application in a iPhone top sellers list, free or paid. I have yet to see any universal application under any top iPad List.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would expect this could actually be accidental. Again, while it is possible that every native iPad application is outselling all iPhone applications, it seems unlikely as the iPad isn't even out yet. I'm sure all us developers who put in extra time developing universal applications would love to see our apps anywhere they could possibly be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClosed as it behaves as expected:\r\n\"You'll see Universal apps when they get bought on the iPad more often.\""
