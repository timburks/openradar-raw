    description: "Summary: \r\nIt is not possible to use Java applets which use SWT under Mac OS X. In order to perform operations on the screen the SWT toolkit need to have access to the main thread of the application and it's not possible yet. When we try to display a SWT component in an applet the output is garbled and the browser hang. It is described in this issue of SWT: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=303869 . According to Apple engineer it could be possible to implement a method/object which allow to run code on the main thread of the NSApplication, thus allowing us to modify SWT to run the display code on the main thread and to have the SWT components working as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Use a version of SWT patched to not throw an exception if it didn't execute on the main thread. (see issue https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=303869 for the lines to modify)\r\n2 - Launch an applet which display SWT oomponents and patched SWT libs,\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe SWT components (in our case Gantt charts) should be displayed and the applet working.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe browser display nothing and the applet hang.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has never worked as far as i know.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the issue in SWT: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=303869 . I'm not from the SWT team but with this feature implemented i could try to develop what miss/need to be changed on the SWT side and contribute it in an issue.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more materials about this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n28-May-2010 01:28 :\r\nEngineering believes this issue has been addressed in Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 7 or Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 2.\r\n\r\nJava for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 2:\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL972\r\nPosted Date: May 18th, 2010\r\n\r\nJava for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 7:\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL971\r\nPosted Date: May 18th, 2010\r\n\r\nPlease verify the issue after installing the appropriate version of the software listed above based on your current OS version and report back with your results."
