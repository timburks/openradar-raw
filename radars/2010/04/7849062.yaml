    description: "Summary: \r\nMultitasking API should include notifications of songs starting, stopping, and pausing for background apps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI was very excited to hear about the Multitasking in iPhone OS 4.0, believing that it would finally allow the Last.fm developers to develop an app that uploads the list of songs I play to their site. (http://www.last.fm/group/Last.fm+for+iPhone+and+iPod+Touch/forum/103852/_/616412)  Sadly, I was mistaken, as the current set of Multitasking features don't allow this use case.\r\n\r\nIf you search for \"audio scrobbler iphone jailbreak\", you'll see that there are a number of people who jailbreak their iPhones and iPod Touches to enable this functionality.  (I'm not one of them, but I do still want to see the feature.)\r\n\r\nBy providing an API which notifies a background app when a song starts, stops, and pauses, you will remove one of the few remaining reasons to jailbreak an iPhone.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBlake."
