    description: "The CFBundleGetInfoString key is deprecated, but the online docs don't specify when it was deprecated or what the potential implications are, and particularly which OS versions are affected and how they react.\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009249-SW3\r\n\r\nSeveral Radars touch on this issue — here are just a few:\r\nrdar://problems/3460308&4331461&4423258&4696179&4712185&4764027&4876909\r\n\r\nIn particular, 4331461 seems to have handled this fairly cleanly in Snow Leopard, but the docs don't seem to reflect the change in a way that is intelligible to developers.\r\n\r\nFinder's \"Get Info\" panel and standard Cocoa about boxes are the most common places this info is displayed.\r\n\r\nFinder on 10.5 prefers CFBundleGetInfoString if it exists, and CFBundleShortVersionString otherwise. It never displays NSHumanReadableCopyright, so many developers continue to use something like \"v1.2, © 2007–2010 My Company\" for CFBundleGetInfoString.\r\n\r\nFinder on 10.6 prefers CFBundleShortVersionString and NSHumanReadableCopyright if they exist.\r\nIf CFBundleShortVersionString and NSHumanReadableCopyright exist, they are both displayed and CFBundleGetInfoString is ignored if it exists.\r\nIf CFBundleGetInfoString and CFBundleShortVersionString exist, the former is used to show the version.\r\nIf CFBundleGetInfoString and NSHumanReadableCopyright exist, only the copyright information is displayed.\r\n\r\nObviously, we hope that developers would provide all the correct replacement plist keys, but in the case that they don't, I would expect that in the last case above, some sort of version info would be displayed. I don't know if this is related to \"CFBundle, CFPlugin/X\" or \"Finder/X\", but it would be nice to let developers know what behavior they should expect. For apps that are deployed on pre- and post-10.6.0 systems, having both old and new keys is important if the information is to be displayed correctly to users."
