    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, iOS devices can connect to WIFI networks requiring Bluesocket authentication.  However, the workflow is seriously flawed --- it is necessary to open Safari to authenticate **each time** the iOS device wakes up from sleep.  At my university, I end up having to key in my username and password to the same login page dozens of times per day.\r\n\r\nThis issue is compounded by the fact that, for example, MobileMail.app pops up a \"Couldn't Connect To Server\" dialog every time it attempts to check mail and fails (prior to authenticating with Bluesocket), and I have to click through a huge stack of these error messages before being able to access Mail.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Bluesocket authentication protocol is fairly common and standardized --- it would be a huge improvement if iOS could natively support authenticating via Bluesocket, automatically, every time the device wakes from sleep, without manual action by the user."
