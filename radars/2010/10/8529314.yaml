    description: "Inspired by the recent ultimatum from Apple to upload binaries for \"squatted\" app names, I decided to delete one of my app entries from iTunes Connect, since I am not anywhere near ready to submit a binary.\r\n\r\nI noticed in the documentation, and I confirmed through a test, that once a developer deletes an app from the roster, it cannot be added back again in the future. I don't know if another developer can then add it back or not.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense that adding and deleting an app from the store, especially if there has never been an upload for it, should permanently prevent that app name from being used again.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the process of \"liberating\" these squatted names, Apple will find a way to make it so that self-liberated app names such as the name \"Clarion\" which I set free should be reclaimable in the future by the developer who liberated it.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening,\r\nDaniel"
