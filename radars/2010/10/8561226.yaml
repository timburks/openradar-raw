    description: "17-Oct-2010 06:30 PM Joachim De Lombaert:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf an event place has been set manually, any attempt to set the event name to the same string as the event place will fail silently. This only impacts renaming events from the Events view by clicking the event name field below the event thumbnail. This is NOT an issue when renaming the event from the event info sheet that results from clicking the i (info) button.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue since that the behavior differs depending on the field used to rename the event and since the user receives no feedback as to why they are unable to use the given string as the event name. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. In the Events view, take a non-geotagged photo and split it off into its own (untitled) event.\r\n1. Name the event \"London\" by clicking the name field beneath the event thumbnail.\r\n2. Press the i (info) button in the bottom right corner of the event to flip over the info sheet.\r\n3. In the \"event place\" field, enter \"London\" (press return to accept the first suggestion with the same name).\r\n4. Press Done to hide the info sheet.\r\n5. Rename the event to \"Cupertino\".\r\n6. Attempt to rename the event to \"London\"  by changing the name field beneath the event thumbnail. Note that the name reverts to \"Cupertino\".\r\n\r\nFor further proof of this issue, repeat steps 2-6 with slightly different data:\r\n\r\n2b. Press the i (info) button in the bottom right corner of the event to flip over the info sheet.\r\n3b. In the \"event place\" field, enter \"Cupertino\" (press return to accept the first suggestion with the same name).\r\n4b. Press Done to hide the info sheet.\r\n5b. Rename the event to \"London\". (Note this will work as expected, unlike step 6 above.)\r\n6b. Attempt to rename the event to \"Cupertino\"  by changing the name field beneath the event thumbnail. Note that the name reverts to \"London\".\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhoto allows any arbitrary event name, regardless of which text field was used to enter the name.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhoto does not allow names that are equivalent to the event place when using the event name text field below the event thumbnail.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested in iPhoto '09 version 8.1.2 (424).\r\nUnable to test in iPhoto '08 because it does not have the Places feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n27-Oct-2010 01:52 PM Joachim De Lombaert:\r\nI am unable to reproduce the issue in iPhoto '11, v9.0 (449). Thank you!\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
