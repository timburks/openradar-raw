    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS4, developers can schedule a recurring UILocalNotification through its property repeatInterval.\r\n\r\nThere is however no way to schedule a local notification to repeat at intervals such as 10 minutes, or 2 hours.\r\n\r\nThe repeatInterval property currently takes an NSCalendarUnit. This means that the three shortest repeating intervals possible are: 1 second, 1 minute followed by 1 hour.\r\n\r\nRepeating by the second has limited use, while the gap between repeating by the minute and by the hour is too huge.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo provide backwards compatibility while introducing the ability to schedule local notifications to repeat at finer intervals, a new NSUInteger @property repeatMultiplier could be introduced.\r\n\r\nWhen repeatMultiplier is more than 0 and repeatInterval is assigned an NSCalendarUnit, the local notification will repeat at the interval specified in repeatInterval multiplied by repeatMultiplier.\r\n\r\nThus, a notification can be set to recur at 10-minute interval by setting repeatInterval to NSMinuteCalendarUnit and repeatMultiplier to 10.\r\n\r\nA notification can be set to recur every other day using by setting repeatInterval to NSDayCalendarUnit and repeatMultiplier to 2."
