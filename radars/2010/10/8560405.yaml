    description: "16-Oct-2010 04:34 PM Nico Weber:\r\nSummary: Need a way to disable content shadow of a window\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: MacVim ( http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ ) has an option to make the window background partially transparent (`:set transparency=50`). Only the background becomes transparent, the text doesn't â€“ just like transparency works in Terminal.app. When the window is transparent, the text shouldn't produce a shadow, only the window frame should.\r\n\r\nNSWindow has the SPI _setContentHasShadow: which does exactly what we want, but it has two problems:\r\n1.) It's an SPI\r\n2.) It stopped working in 10.5 for some reason (it's what Terminal.app calls, so we're probably just using it wrong, due to it being not documented due to it being an SPI).\r\n\r\nExpected Results: An API to disable the contents shadow exists.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No such API exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: This is also a problem for iTerm and Chromium."
