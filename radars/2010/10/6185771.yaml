    description: "29-Aug-2008 12:19 PM Joachim De Lombaert:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn certain situations, Mac OS Setup Assistant / Mac Buddy enters an extra space character between user's first and last names.  When the user tries to enter her full name into an authentication dialog, she is unable to authenticate since she only enters one space character.  The difference in the expected input is usually too subtle for users to detect, causing frustration when they are unable to authenticate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTo create an affected account (this is the behavior I have watched users perform):\r\n1. Have Mac OS Setup Assistant run at startup (reinstalling Mac OS or removing .AppleSetupDone).\r\n2. At the user information / registration screen, start typing in your full name in the first name field.\r\n3. Realize that you have typed your full name in the first name field.\r\n4. Delete the last name you typed into the first name field.  Note that here users tend to delete only the visible characters, leaving the space at the end of their first name.\r\n5. Enter your last name into the last name field and fill out the rest of the form accordingly.\r\n6. The Mac OS Setup Assistant concatenates the two values with a space between them resulting in an extra space between the names. (i.e. \"First \" + \" \" + \"Last\" => \"First  Last\")\r\n\r\nThis issue is most visible when:\r\n1. The user has set up both an administrator account and a standard account on his machine\r\n2. The administrator account is affected by the extra space issue.\r\nHowever, the same issue can be reproduced directly in the first administrator account by retyping the prefilled full user name.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the authentication issue\r\n1. Log in as the standard account user and attempt an action requiring administrator privileges.\r\n2. Type in the full name of the admininistrator and password at the authentication prompt.\r\n3. Authentication fails unless you add an extra space between the first and last name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTyping in the user's full name and password successfully authenticates the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTyping in the user's full name and password fails to authenticate the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHappens on any version of the Mac OS that displays the Mac OS Setup Assistant at first boot.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnticipated Fix:\r\nTrim whitespace from edges of both first and last name before concatenating them with a space.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI provide Macintosh support to about 150 users and I have seen this at least 10 times among those users.  I have also noticed it at least 10 times elsewhere on computers of friends/family/other acquaintances.\r\n\r\nThis is also an issue with third-party software that automatically fills in the user's full name as given by the system in registration dialogs.  The extra space is hard to notice, so users are frustrated when their serial numbers aren't accepted even though all fields appear to contain the correct data.\r\n\r\nThe extra space also looks strange to perceptive eyes in anything else using the user's full name such as the iChat buddy list window.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue that at first seems cosmetic but in practice does cause unexpected failures, especially in authentication.\r\n\r\nIf users notice the issue, they can change their full name in the Accounts preference pane and remove the extra space from their address book card."
