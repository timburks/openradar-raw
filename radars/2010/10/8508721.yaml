    description: "We're in 2010, this whole \"sample code as a Zip File\" makes no sense :) Please put the code on GitHub or worst case on your own servers but in a git (or worst case SVN) repository.\r\n\r\nThis way (github) we'd be able to fork the sample code and ask pull requests.\r\n\r\nAnything \"near\" what I ask would already be very nice!\r\n\r\nPS: and, yeah, obviously: THANKS for the sample code!"
