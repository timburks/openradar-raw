    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading files to a SharePoint 2010 WebDAV share, the upload fails with a -36 error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. From the Finder, select Go > Connect to Server…\r\n2. Enter a SharePoint 2010 WebDAV share. (for example, https://my.sharepoint.school.edu/personal/username/)\r\n3. Open the Personal Documents folder.\r\n4. Copy a file from your local machine to the Personal Documents folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file should copy successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe copy is aborted with the following error:\r\n'The Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in “Some File.pdf” can’t be read or written.\r\n(Error code -36)'\r\nAdditionally, the file will appear on the share, but will have zero bytes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUpon mounting the WedDAV share, the following message appears in the Console multiple times:\r\n\r\nwebdavfs_agent\t(finish != bytes) failed; going to _CFGregorianDateCreateWithBytes; file: /SourceCache/webdavfs/webdavfs-293.1/mount.tproj/webdav_network.c; line: 121\r\n\r\nOthers have reported this same problem:\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.info.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=12135965\r\n\r\nUpdate 09-Nov-2010 10:42 AM:\r\nUsing cp seems to work.\r\n\r\n$ cp Desktop/TestTextFile.txt /Volumes/grigutis/Personal\\ Documents/\r\ncp: Desktop/TestTextFile.txt: could not copy extended attributes to /Volumes/grigutis/Personal Documents/TestTextFile.txt: Operation not permitted\r\n\r\nIt doesn't handle the extended attributes (com.apple.TextEncoding in this case), but the file does appear on the share with the correct contents (not zero bytes like when copying with the Finder)."
