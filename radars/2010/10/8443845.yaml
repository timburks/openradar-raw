    description: "17-Sep-2010 12:25 PM Goffredo Marocchi:\r\nSummary: I imported this .xls file through dropbox and I also tried to send it by e-mail to myself to open the file through the Mail.app on my iPhone 3GS (iOS 4.1). The file is not rendered correctly as the date on each cell in the top row of the file shows the correct Month and Year, but the incorrect Day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: open the provided .xls file on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Properly rendered .xls file.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Dates are not rendered correctly.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: I have attached a screenshot taken on the iPhone, a screenshot taken on OS X (file opened through OpenOffice 3.2.1 which created it in the first place [file was saved in MS Office 97/XP/2003 .xls mode]), and the .xls file itself.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The problem also arises when I use OS X's built-in preview functionality. I attached a screenshot showing that problem occurring on OS X too."
