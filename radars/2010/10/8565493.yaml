    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe need a way to mirror an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad interface on a Mac screen/Projector when giving demos.\r\n\r\nThis is possible with various Apps for jail-broken devices, such as iDemo, Display Recorder, ScreenSplitr, VNC servers and others. But as a developer I really don’t want to jail-break a device just for this purpose. We need a supported, official way to accurately represent the UI of a device that mirrors the hardware when giving demos, especially of Apps that we don't have control over and can't code this facility for.\r\n\r\nIt's possible, we know that, as we have seen Steve do it many, many times in the keynotes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPlug a video cable into one of the iPhone devices, wired to a projector, just as Steve does on stage, with the expectation that the complete UI would be displayed in all its glory on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe expectation that the complete UI would be output. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t do that; nothing works.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPerhaps a developer-only background App that does this, downloadable as source from the Apple site, that we can self-sign and install, and mirrors the complete UI via the video-out?"
