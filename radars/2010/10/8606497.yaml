    description: "28-Oct-2010 01:24 PM David Wheeler:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen accessing \"Developer on iTunes\" in iTunes U in iTunes on the iPad or iPhone (for example, via the \"Getting Started Videos\" link on https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action), one gets this error message:\r\n\r\n    You do not have access to this page.\r\n\r\nAccording to devprograms@apple.com:\r\n\r\n> Please know that content from WWDC is only available via iTunes U on a Mac Machine, as such you would not be able to access this content via your iOS device. \r\n\r\nRecommendation: Change the error message to something like\r\n\r\n  This section of iTunes U can only be access from a Mac.\r\n\r\nOr something to show that there's another way to get the content.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOn an iOS device, go to https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action. Login if you haven't. Click the \"Getting Started Videos\" link. iOS will switch to iTunes and attempt to load the \"Developer on iTunes\" part of iTunes U.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpect a message telling the user that the content is not available on iOS, and how to get it. Better yet, allow it to be accessed on iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nError message: \"You do not have access to this page.\" An inaccurate and therefore misleading message.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
