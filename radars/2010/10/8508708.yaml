    description: "As I'm guessing many (tons of) people, I'd like to see GC implemented (very) soon on iOS. Obviously for anything being nowadays (OS 4) able to multi task, and even if it's only for iPhone/iPod touch 4 or upwards, that would be fine.\r\n\r\nCheers, and thanks for the (already) awesome work you guys do."
