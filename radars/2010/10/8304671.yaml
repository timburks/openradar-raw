    description: It would really make our app better if we were able to get key events from a hardware keyboard, i.e. shift + tab and arrow key events. As it stands, we can create a class that implements the UITextInput protocol to get changes to text, but this doesn't allow us to know what key modifiers were held down or if arrow keys were pressed.
