    description: "17-Oct-2010 12:55 PM Rodger Combs:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using a 1000mA USB charging adapter, iOS devices (including all generations of the iPhone, the iPod Touch, and the iPad) behave very erratically. Unusual behaviors include incorrect touch locations and duplicate touches being created.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a 1000mA USB charger to a 120 volt wall outlet and to an iOS device using an Apple dock connector <-> USB cable\r\n2. Attempt to use the iPhone as usual (most noticeable when using the onscreen keyboard)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeys and other buttons touched react normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTouching a location on the touchscreen results in a random reaction elsewhere onscreen\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue seems to appear on all generations of all iOS devices (tested on iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, and iPad WiFi+3G). The bug has been observed on iOS 3.1.3, 3.2, 3.2.1, 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.1, and all betas of 4.2 (except beta 3, which I have not yet tested).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone\r\n\r\n17-Oct-2010 01:02 PM Rodger Combs:\r\nNOTE: This seems to happen on some iPhone chargers and not others. Here's a link to one which is know to cause the bug:\r\nhttp://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.25372"
