    description: Many Mac applications store log files under ~/Library/Logs/app-identifier. This is consistent with Apple's applications and supports integration with the Console app. Including these folders in the list of supported write locations would allow apps to maintain this behavior while still supporting easy removal of the data on uninstall.
