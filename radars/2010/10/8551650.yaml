    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niWork for iPad on iOS 4.2 can't insert a Photo the way it works on iOS 3.2.2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn a Pages Document (on iPad) select a photo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe photo should be inserted where the \"cursor\" is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing happens, the image stays selected in the Media Browser\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt works on previous iOS (pre 4.2)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is a dupe and also guessing this will be fixed by a Pages update rather than an iOS update, but better dupe it then forget it! :-)"
