    description: When you develop application that has deployment target iOS 3.0 and base SDK iOS 4.1 it is easy to start using APIs that was introduced in 4.1 but doesn't exist on 3.0. If you will run such an application on old device then you will get crash. I think developer tools should provide automatic checking for such cases and warn developer if they are.
