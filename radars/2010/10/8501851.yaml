    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, the contents of the PRAM (NVRAM) in Mac Computers can become corrupted, for example when the system crashes or is rebooted while data is written to it. It is not even necessary to modify a PRAM setting manually (for example via bless), sometimes a system crash at a bad time can be enough.\r\nSince the PRAM contents are crucial for selecting a boot device and setting up the computer after boot, Mac OS X will run in a very unstable state, requiring a full fsck of the system volume (and thus taking very long to boot) and displaying error messages like \"_CFGetHostUUIDString: unable to determine UUID for host. Error: 35\" in the system log.\r\nIn these circumstances, EFI or Mac OS X should do the smart thing and reset the PRAM automatically or display a message to the user that the PRAM is corrupted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Cause the PRAM to become corrupted, for example by cutting power while writing a setting with nvram or bless.\r\n2. Reboot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. EFI and Mac OS X boot into a stable state\r\n2. EFI or Mac OS X display an error message that the PRAM is corrupted\r\nand/or\r\n2. The PRAM is reset automatically (if possible)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The system takes very long to boot due to a full fsck on the system volume being run\r\n2. The system runs very unstable, displaying lots of \"_CFGetHostUUIDString: unable to determine UUID for host. Error: 35\" messages in the system log and having problems with certain software due to it\r\n3. kernel_task saturates one CPU core with 100% load\r\n4. The bless and nvram tools display error messages (\"nvram is not supported on this system\", \"Can't access \"efi-boot-device\" NVRAM variable\", \"Could not find IODeviceTree:/options\")\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was experienced on a MacBook5,1 running Mac OS X 10.6.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is known that the PRAM can easily be reset with cmd-alt-p-r, but since no useful error message is shown, this problem is very hard to diagnose. After all, it could also be caused by a faulty PRAM or a broken chipset or processor."
