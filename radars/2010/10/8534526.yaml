    description: "11-Oct-2010 11:12 AM Stephen Thorne:\r\nSummary: We installed Mac OS X Server to use for Open Directory. Initial install was on DHCP, and we changed the IP address to be statically allocated on an assigned IP address afterwards. Then the entire server became unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the server using DHCP.\r\n2. Set up Open Directory.\r\n3. Change the IP address to a static IP on a different IP to what DHCP gave.\r\n4. Delete a user account.\r\n5. Close and reopen Workgroup Manager\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user account that was deleted should be gone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user account still exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe 'delete user account' was just one example of many operations that simply don't work. Using either Workgroup manager or commandline tools don't work as expected in this situation."
