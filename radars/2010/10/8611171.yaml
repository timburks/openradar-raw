    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niOS beta releases expire without warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Install iOS beta release\r\n2) Wait\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSome kind of warning, like those displayed for expiring provisioning profiles, should be displayed by the OS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"plug into iTunes\" screen is displayed AFTER expiration. At this point, it's not possible to sync or recover any data off of the device. Oddly, it can still be used to play music using the remote clicker on the standard headphones.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNot known. Apple has never been explicit about how and when it expires iOS beta releases.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\niOS developers are well aware of Apple's advice to not install beta releases on personal devices. The primary reason for this enhancement request is because there is often test data and other information on the device with no means to extract it. In essence, developers are faced with data loss.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways this situation could be avoided:\r\n\r\n1) Apple could explicitly state how long a beta release will be active. Developers can then generate a warning themselves (using iCal or some other alarm.)\r\n\r\n2) Apple could allow syncing on a device that has expired. The fact that the device is able to play music after expiration means that background processes are still running. The process that performs syncing could be one of those processes.\r\n\r\n3) Apple could implement a warning mechanism similar to the one used for device provisioning. This would allow developers to sync and install a new beta before being locked out. This is the preferred solution."
