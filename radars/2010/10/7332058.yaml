    description: "23-Oct-2009 03:13 PM Joachim De Lombaert:\r\nSummary:\r\nFinder window headers move at different speeds than list content when scrolling horizontally, causing a distracting \"jiggly\" visual issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI was able to reproduce this consistently in a single Finder window. The problem went away when I increased the window width such that the horizontal scroll bar disappeared and then decreased it back to approximately the previous size (in 2 steps, that is two click and drags of the resize handle).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHeaders should move directly according to the scroll bar position.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder window headers appear to \"jiggle\" because they are not moving in a way that corresponds with the scroll bar position. They are usually delayed in movement \r\nSee attached screen recording, or the same file at http://external.pcheese.net/bugs/jiggly-headers.mov\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMacBookPro5,1 unibody 2.53Ghz 4GB RAM with the \"higher performance\" 9600M GT currently activated.\r\nCurrent uptime >7 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n'jiggly-headers.mov' was successfully uploaded"
