    description: "Summary:\r\nWe see a long delay between the CNS doing a successful WISPr login, and the device indicating to the user they are connected â€“ see 8bi below. \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFirst time use\r\n1.\tDevice connects to SSID. \r\n2.\tCNS kicks in and pops up the landing page within websheet. \r\n3.\tUser enters valid credential. \r\n4.\tUser is logged in and connected to Internet. \r\n5.\tUser logs out from the network via browser. \r\n6.\tDevice disconnects from SSID. \r\n7.\tDevice reconnects to SSID. \r\n8.\tAfter a few seconds, the web service log shows that device has made a POST request to the WISPr login URL and the response is \"200 (393)\" which indicates that login is successful. The device IP address is also whitelisted in the network. There are two scenarios following this event:\r\n8a. User does not do anything. After a few minutes, user goes to iTunes and the CNS kicks in and connects user to the Internet. This behaviour is fine. \r\n                8b. Immediately after user is successfully authenticated by our network, user opens Safari and tries to browse.  If device is iPhone4, browser shows message \"Not connected to Internet\". After >1 minute, CNS kicks in and user is connected to Internet and can browse on Safari. Why is there a delay?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo long delay\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBrowser shows message \"Not connected to Internet\". After >1 minute, CNS kicks in and user is connected to Internet and can browse on Safari."
