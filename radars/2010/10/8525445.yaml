    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMany of the navigation buttons in iTunes Connect do not display correctly in Safari. This is a serious problem because these missing buttons are often on confirmation dialogs (and you don't know if you're confirming or canceling a change.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Login to iTunes Connect and verify that your browser is using a HTTPS connection.\r\n2) Select \"Manage Your Applications\"\r\n3) Select an Application to go to its information page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"Done\" button image should be displayed in the lower-right corner.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA broken image is displayed (a question mark in a blue box.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt used to work, and since there's no publicly visible version number for the deployment, you're on your own...\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be caused by a reference to an image with an HTTP URL. In the example above, the HTML for the page is:\r\n\r\n<img border=\"0\" class=\"doneActionButton-disabled\" style=\"display:none;\" src=\"http://itunesconnect.apple.com/itc/images/button-done-blue.png\" />\r\n\r\nSafari fails to load the image as it redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. This can be verified with the Web Inspector in Safari."
