    description: "If a developer attempts to add a Mac Bundle ID to the Mac App Store, and that bundle ID has previously been registered as an app bundle ID in the iOS App Store, the bundle ID is rejected:\r\n\r\n\"The bundle identifier you have specified is already in use. Please select another.\"\r\n\r\nThis leads to a quandary for any developer who has a version of an app for the Mac, and a version of that same app for iOS, and chose (perhaps foolishly) to use the same bundle ID for each.\r\n\r\nThe Mac application cannot be submitted using its existing bundle identifier, which may have been in use for years.  Changing the bundle ID on the Mac app would lead to a variety of issues such as change of preferences location, and possibly issues  integrating with 3rd party applications that expect to find an application by its bundle ID.\r\n\r\nChanging the bundle ID of the iPhone application would probably have fewer dire consequences, except Apple doesn't allow the bundle identifier to be changed on an existing app, and if an application is deleted, the bundle identifier is apparently given up forever:\r\n\r\n\"Once the app is deleted, the app name becomes available for use by the developer community and you will not be able to re-use the app name, SKU, or bundle ID.\"\r\n\r\nSoooooooooâ€¦\r\n\r\nIf you made the mistake of creating a bundle identifier in the iOS App Store that happens to be the same as a long-shipping Mac app that you would like to add to the Mac App Store, you're screwed.\r\n\r\nI think Apple can address this in any of numerous ways, including:\r\n\r\n1. Don't share the namespace of bundle app IDs across iOS and Mac App Stores. This seems like the obvious solution, since it will save a lot of grief for everybody in one fell swoop on Apple's part. \r\n\r\n2. Allow for existing bundle identifiers in the iOS App Store to be changed or deleted without sacrificing future use of that bundle ID. (While you're at it, let us re-use our deleted app names! Come on :) ).\r\n\r\nPlease do something to address this before the Mac App Store starts accepting submissions. Developers will have to jump through incredibly bad hoops to get this to work right and upload to the Mac App Store.  It won't be pretty."
