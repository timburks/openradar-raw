    description: "30-Sep-2010 10:04 PM Steve Streza:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI am using the HTML5 offline application cache features of Safari to build an app cached to the device. A few of my testers have reported that the app is taking a long time to load, despite the cache. I sent them a debug page which displays a color based on the state of the application cache, and was able to learn that these users' instances of Safari were showing that the application cache has a status of \"uncached\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch the application from the URL for the first time (so the app will not have cached yet)\r\n2. Wait for the app to finish loading\r\n3. Reload the application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe application will load much faster, as it is loaded from the application cache.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe application will not load from the cache, and will load much more slowly.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown what causes this issue. It is the exact same code being loaded for working and non-working devices. I have had reports of this happening on phones which are both jailbroken and non-jailbroken.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI cannot reproduce this at all, but specific users can. When they can, the feature is consistently broken, despite rebuilding the manifest file. Every user who has reported it has been on iOS 4.1.\r\n\r\nThe application URL is found at: http://swearch.me/app/\r\nThe test URL is found at: http://swearch.me/app/test-cache.html\r\n\r\nThe test page will show a rectangle with the following colors for a given app cache status:\r\n\r\nuncached: red\r\nidle: green\r\nchecking: yellow\r\ndownloading: orange\r\nupdateready: white"
