    description: "07-Oct-2010 03:23 PM David Weiss:\r\nSummary: Unable to access a photo's title with a ALAssetRepresentation\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI'm trying to bulk import a group of images into my iPhone app _with_ their associated title, and I can't seem to get this metadata from the framework. \r\n\r\n1. In iPhoto, have a group with a collection of pictures, where each picture has a title\r\n2. Sync the iPhoto group (Event or Album) with your iOS device.\r\n3. Using the Assets Library Framework to access the photos in this group\r\n4. Try to access the title of each photo in the group\r\n\r\nThe trouble comes when I try to inspect the photo for it's title:\r\n\r\nALAssetRepresentation *assetDefaultRepresentation = [result defaultRepresentation];\r\nNSDictionary *metadata = assetDefaultRepresentation.metadata;\r\nNSLog(@\"%@\", metadata);\r\n\r\nMore directly, I was hoping there would be a value for title that I could request direction of the ALAssetRepresentation. I get that the metadata is for EXIF stuff.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Ability to get a photo's title\r\n\r\nActual Results: Unable to get a photo's title\r\n\r\nRegression: This is 100% reproducible on all iOS 4 capable devices.\r\n\r\nNotes: The app I am working on is called Names. It's an app that helps teacher's learn student names. They often have a collection of pictures (or can export a collection of pictures) where the photo's file name is the student name. A typical teacher may have 200-300 students each semester! Adding each of these names to each photo on the iPhone is tedious at best, especially when they already have the photo and name correlated. Other customers are students using it to memorize rocks, plants and even artwork for different classes, and frequently the file name is already a title for the photo. I'd like to be able to use this information without having to build my own Mac and Windows syncing app. If I could access the title of the photo I'd be all set."
