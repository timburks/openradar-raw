    description: "Summary:\r\nAssetsLibrary.framework [(ALAssetsRepresentation*)object metadata] does not return all standard metadata on iOS.\r\n\r\nI am attempting to read standard metadata (i.e. ExifAux or even some Exif fields) using the \"metadata\" message to an ALAssetsRepresentation object retrieved from the AssetsLibrary framework.  Not all of the embedded metadata is returned.  \r\n  * If I look at the metadata using ImageIO on Mac OS the metadata is present.\r\n  * If I look at the metadata using ImageIO on iOS there is metadata missing.\r\n  * If I use 3rd party code to read the image data directly on iOS the metadata is present.\r\n\r\nThe results are the same if I read a  JPG directly from disk or going through AssetsLibrary. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample projects (one each for iOS and Mac OS using ImageIO, and one that uses AssetsLibrary)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsing the same image file, the metadata dictionary should be the same\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iOS metadata dictionary is significantly reduced (44 keys) compared to the full dictionary provided by Mac OS (59 keys)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown."
