    description: "Most first class Mac apps, including my own shipping Mac app (XXXX), run into issues with the Cocoa API where the only solution is to use private APIs.  These solutions are almost always suggested by AppKit or WWDR engineers as the only solution to customize, workaround or fix pieces of the public API.  Section 2.5 of the Mac App Store guidelines state that because my apps use private APIs, most of which were recommended by Apple engineers, they will be rejected from the app store.\r\n\r\nI suggest that perhaps there needs to be an interim way to handle situations like mine.  I have talked to many other developers and they almost all have the same issue.  I don't want to continue using private APIs, I'd much rather have the few APIs fixed that commonly need to be worked around.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps a roll out strategy would be best.  For instance, the 10.6 version of the app store submission process could just record and report (in detail with a strong warning) Private API usage with the knowledge that non-public APIs would become reject worthy for the Mac App Store with the advent of 10.7 Lion.  This would give Apple time to analyze the most commonly used private APIs and possibly introduce public versions of them or provide public workarounds of some other type. It would also give developers more than 80 days to find an alternative to something that may not have actually have an alternative currently.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThe three parts of Cocoa which require private API usage that come most prevalently to mind are: NSTableView/NSOutlineView, NSTextView and NSTokenField."
