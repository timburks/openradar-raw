    description: "Summary: I think that Multitasking should be made into a first class citizen and the current approach of single tapping the Home button for suspending the app/going into Spotlight search mode and double tapping the Home button to open the Multitasking bar is the least intuitive way.\r\nI would like to invert the previous mentioned functionality, that is making it so that the Home button opens the Multitasking bar when tapped once and suspend the app (exits to Home screen) when tapped twice. If users are going to switch between running apps often, requiring them to double tap the Home button (which might lead to exiting to the Home screen).\r\nIt is true that it would be a change in functionality for users, but it can be applied to all iOS devices and it would work well in all of them as they all face the same issues when dealing with Multitasking the way it is implemented now. [NDA'ed information removed]\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: tap the Home button once.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: the Multitasking bar is opened.\r\n\r\nActual Results: the iOS exits to the Home screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: this also applies to all devices running iOS like iPod Touch, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 4"
