    description: "Summary:I have recently signed up for MobileMe and via web interface I have the options when sending/replying to mail to choose the account that the message is sent from, and given the ability to set a default address to send messages from. Mail.app on the iPhone seems to completely ignore these settings and I am forced to send messages from my @me.com account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Get a MobileMe account. Setup an alias address in the web interface. Set your \"default\" email address to the alias address. Sync iPhone. Send message from iPhone. Message sent with the @me.com address, not the alias one.  Alternatively, receive a message on the alias address. Reply to message. Reply sent with @me.com address\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Emails are sent out with the \"default\" alias address when originated on the phone, and when replying to a message the reply should come from the account the message was originally sent to.\r\n\r\nActual Results: All messages come from the @me.com address.\r\n\r\nRegression: This problem has always existed for me.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
