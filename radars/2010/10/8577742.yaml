    description: "When having a FaceTime call with an iPhone or iPod, the face of the Mac user is rather small on the screen. This is because the normal distance of the Mac user to the camera is greater than on the phone.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if one could change the area of the face that is transmitted in the video call."
