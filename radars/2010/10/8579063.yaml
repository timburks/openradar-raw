    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Aperture, running face detection makes the machine unresponsive and drains the battery very quickly. Detecting about 1500 faces took my battery from 70% down to 18% in about an hour.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: MacBook Pro 2.8 GHz; 4 GB RAM; 500 GB HD with 100 GB free disk space. (spx attached) Applications running were:\r\n- Aperture\r\n- Terminal\r\n- LaunchBar\r\n- Safari \r\n\r\nI was offline (not connected to the Internet).\r\n\r\nDuring this time, I ran top and noticed constant pageins. I observed the Finder and Aperture CPU usage both alternately and concurrently spiking, with the Finder using over 80% and the Aperture usage hitting over 190%.\r\n\r\nAfter Face Detection finished, it took a while for the machine to recover -- as other apps had to be paged back in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 Install Aperture 2\r\n2 Import about 2000 photos (mostly NEF 6 MP RAW)\r\n3 Upgrade to Aperture 3.0, 3.0.x, 3.1\r\n4 Let Aperture detect faces\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFace detection \r\n- can run in the background\r\n- completes quickly\r\n- does not cause the CPU to spike\r\n- does not cause the fans to run at full speed\r\n- does not cause the battery to drain rapidly\r\n- does not pre-empt other tasks\r\n- does not cause the Finder's CPU to spike\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMachine is unusable for other tasks for the duration of Face Detection.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone performed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease don't pretend there's something unique about my library or configuration. Don't ask me to reproduce this; don't ask for a copy of my library; don't ask for samples, stack shots, shark traces, etc."
