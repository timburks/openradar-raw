    description: "For Open Radar users: see the stackoverflow question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3904746/mpmusicplayercontroller-not-posting-notifications\r\n\r\n11-Oct-2010 12:31 PM Benjamin Collins:\r\n'sample_code.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Oct-2010 12:31 PM Benjamin Collins:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the MPMusicPlayerController as described by the iPod Library Programming Guide and the AddMusic sample, the MPMusicPlayerController fails to post notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGet instance of MPMusicPlayerController using applicationPlayer method.  Register for notifications, use the beginGeneratingPlaybackNotifications method to enable notifications, set the playback queue using an MPMediaItemCollection, and then use the play method to start the player.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotifications should fire as a result of calling play/pause, or as a result of the player finishing playback of the playback queue (or switching songs).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notifications are posted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe AddMusic sample works on my device, but my app doesn't.  I can't discern any difference between the two apps with respect to how the MPMusicPlayerController API is used."
