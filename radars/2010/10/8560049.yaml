    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe @2x \"double PNG\" paradigme is a bit of a nonsense. We should be able to use the power of WebKit and \"feed\" a UIImage with a SVG file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn any modern iPhone app you have to export your file in 2 resolutions, which is really not ideal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the ability to use (and see in Interface Builder!) a SVG (or .ai or .pdf) file in a UIImage/UIButton.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is all easily doable with WebKit, as shows \"RafaelJS\" using the \"SVG path\" that you can get from Illustrator."
