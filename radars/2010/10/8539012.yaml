    description: "Summary: The rotation lock switch on the edge of the iPad now mutes the volume in iOS 4.2, affecting usability.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Toggle the rotation lock switch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The screen rotation locks/unlocks.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The volume mutes/unmutes.\r\n\r\nRegression: Earlier versions of iOS on the iPad to not have this issue.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nOn the iPhone, muting is an important feature that needs to be quickly accessible. The phone rings when it is called. Users need to be able to quickly mute their phones when they are in a location where an unexpected ring might disturb others.\r\n\r\nThe iPad, however, does not receive phone calls, and thus (for the most part) it does not ring unexpectedly. Users are also much less likely to take it with them to a location, such as a theater or restaurant, where this mute function would receive a lot of use.\r\n \r\nThe iPad does, though, see heavy use near couches, beds and laps: all places where the device is frequently held at odd angles, and the user themselves may be in an odd orientation as well. In these common situations, controlling the rotation of the device is of much greater importance.\r\n\r\nAn argument could be made (and I suspect, was) that feature parity across iOS devices should include the existence of a dedicated mute switch. However, the iPad is a much different beast than its smaller iPhone and iPod touch brethren. I would argue that a feature used much more often (rotation lock) should have the dedicated switch, and that the previous functionality of holding the volume down toggle to mute was nearly as fast, and certainly fast enough. In contrast, iOS 4.2 has sped up the muting functionality slightly, while making the rotation lock a double-click, swipe and tap affair that takes far longer and annoys at least half a dozen registered developer users that I know, when polled about the issue. (I have encouraged them to file bugs with you as well.)\r\n\r\nHaving a system preference for this setting to switch between the two functions would be acceptable, but removing the original functionality completely is not."
