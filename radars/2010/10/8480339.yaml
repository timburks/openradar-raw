    description: "A user has logged in previously to our WISPr-compliant test network in our UK office and stored credentials in the web sheet. When they come to log in again, they are logged in but then the device sends a logout request shortly afterwards and the user is presented with a websheet with no credentials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. User logs in to The Cloud WISPr-compliant hotspot via websheet (and stores credentials)\r\n1. User goes away for a while. Session ends and user is logged out.\r\n1. User comes back to hotspot and picks up Wi-Fi\r\n1. Device logs in automatically using WISPr and stored credentials\r\n1. Our network confirms that user is logged in via WISPr (device IP is permitted to send traffic through to internet)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWe expect the user to go online\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAfter a few seconds, the websheet pops up and the user is prompted to enter credentials again\r\n\r\nLooking at the device logs (attached), we can see that the device sent a logout request"
