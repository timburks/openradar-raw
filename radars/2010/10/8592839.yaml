    description: "Developers are often told that the best way to get attention for an issue is to get others to file duplicate bug reports. This is inefficient for both developers and Apple:\r\n\r\n * The reporter must write up enough of a bug report for it to be recognized as a duplicate or file a bug stating only \"This is a duplicate of X\".\r\n \r\n * Apple must review the bug, recognize it as a duplicate, find the original, and close the duplicate.\r\n \r\nProposal:\r\n\r\nAdd a simple method in Bug Reporter to indicate support for a known bug number. This could be just an automation of the existing process: When using this method a bug would be created and immediately closed as a duplicate of the original issue. Notifications would still be generated to bring attention to the issue as if the process had been done manually, but much less time would be spent reporting and dealing with known duplicates."
