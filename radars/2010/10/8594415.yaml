    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPlease please please please please please please please please please please please add an API to the iOS developer portal. Keeping an updated list of development devices is an absolute nightmare, even with the ability to provision via Xcode. \r\n\r\nAs an iOS development company we work on multiple developer accounts, for ourselves and clients, and to keep all of the devices updated on all of the accounts really is an incredible cumbersome process. The same goes for provisioning profiles.\r\n\r\nIf I understand the enterprise program correctly, this will also go a long way towards distribution, even enabling a much more streamlined workflow for continuous integration"
