    description: "02-Dec-2010 11:50 AM Branton Homer:\r\nSummary:\r\nUIView's animateWithDuration:animations: is a wonderfully convenient method. However, I often find myself having to use the far more verbose animateWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completion: just to define the UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction option. I believe this should be the default behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse +[UIView animateWithDuration:animations] to define an animation that takes 10 seconds. While the animation is in progress, attempt to interact with the application in some other way, such as tapping a UIButton.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button can be tapped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button cannot be tapped until the animation is complete.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone; the behavior has always been this way since the method was introduced.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe UIKit release notes have suggested that the default behavior of animateWithDuration:animations: might change in the future. This ticket is intended to express support for changing that default to include allowing user interactions."
