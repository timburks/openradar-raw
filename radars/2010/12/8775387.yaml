    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a UIViewController that contains a UITabBar. I am presenting a UIActionSheet which has a few buttons that present a modal view controller. When the modal view controller is presented, the UIActionSheet should dismiss itself and the modal view should be on the top of the stack. The problem is, the UIActionSheet does not dismiss, and the modal view is loaded behind it. This problem did not occur up until iOS 4.2.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a TabBar project, setting your Base SDK to iOS 4.2.1\r\n2. Create a button or trigger to show a UIActionSheet\r\n3. Allow one of the buttons in the UIActionSheet to present a modal view controller using the syntax: [actionSheet showFromTabBar:self.parentViewController.tabBarController.tabBar];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The UIActionSheet should dismiss itself, and the modal view should appear in front\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The UIActionSheet does not get dismissed and the modal view appears behind it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem was not apparent prior to iOS 4.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have tried other ways of displaying the UIActionSheet all of which don't work as intended:\r\n\r\n//[actionSheet showInView:self.parentViewController.tabBarController.tabBar];\r\n//[actionSheet showInView:[self.view window]];\r\n//[actionSheet showInView:self.parentViewController.tabBarController.view];\r\n//[actionSheet showInView:[UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow];"
