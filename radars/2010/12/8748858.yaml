    description: "Summary: \r\nAudio MIDI setup offers the possibility to automatically reconnect statically linked networked midi clients but it fails to do so\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nSetup manually a midi client to the network directory and check the box for 'automatically reconnect to [session name]'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter reboot or closing of all the midi hosts, restart a host application and AMS should reconnect the midi to the networked client. Also the AMS GUI should reflect the connected state by showing the client in participants list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe client is shown on the participants list, but no midi information is transferred. Only by manually disconnecting the client and then manually connecting the client back, enables the transfer of midi info."
