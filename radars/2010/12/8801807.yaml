    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe current development tools available in MobileSafari are anemic compared to the toolset in the desktop release. This make troubleshooting and development of Web-apps targeted to Mobile Safari difficult to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enable the Debug console in Settings -> Safari -> Develop\r\n2. Notice that the console provides only minimal feedback and limited utility.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA robust developer toolset similar to desktop Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA simplistic debug console that doesn't even provide full details of errors that reach the console.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt's been like this forever.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe developer tools provided with MobileSafari are less than stellar. While it's only been in recent years that such tools have been made available in the first place, they have become invaluable to developers working with Web apps. It would be ideal to have the full suite of developer tools available in desktop safari present in the mobile version as well. Barring full implementation of the various inspectors an improved, interactive console would be a major step forward. The ability to inspect the current state of the application and it's objects via an interactive console that returns complete information would be very useful.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please provide a mechanism for reaching the console for without Web.app-hosted applications. Within these apps, even the existing console is unavailable."
