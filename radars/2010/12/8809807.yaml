    description: "Summary:\r\nUninstallation of an app from an iPhone and iPad by default removes all data stored by the app. However, this does not include the removal of any scheduled local notifications.\r\n\r\nIf the app is reinstalled, any previously scheduled local notifications by the app continue to persist. This is OK if the scheduled notification is a one-time notification. But local notifications that are set to repeat every minute/hour will continue to sound.\r\n\r\nSince the app's data have been wiped out by the uninstallation, the app will most probably not reflect the previously scheduled notification and provide no means to remove them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Schedule a UILocalNotification that repeats every minute in 5 minutes time\r\n2) Remove the app from the device\r\n3) Reinstall the app onto device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe previously scheduled UILocalNotification should have been wiped out along with its own data upon uninstallation.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nThe previously scheduled notification will sound every minute when it triggers\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApps will have to check if the app is newly installed, and run their own UIApplication:cancelAllLocalNotifications to make sure that no previously scheduled local notifications remain."
