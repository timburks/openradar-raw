    description: "14-Dec-2010 04:08 PM Claire Connelly:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nKeychain Access provides a menu-bar item that includes a Lock Screen option.  Selecting this option causes the screen to lock such that you need to type a password to unlock the screen and access the computer.\r\n\r\nWith the 27\" Cinema Display, locking the screen via this method fails.  Once selected, the screen goes black as expected, but after about 10-11 seconds, the desktop appears again and the computer is completely accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConnect a MacBookPro6,2 or similar model to a 27\" Apple Cinema Display.  Add the keychain menu item (Keychain Access, Preferences, General tab, \"Show Status in Menu Bar\").  Click the padlock icon and select Lock Screen.  Wait.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nScreen locks.  Computer is secure.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nScreen goes black as expected then unlocks, leaving computer vulnerable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe Lock Screen option works with other monitors, such as my Dell 2005FP connected via DVI.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA workaround is to do Lock Screen, wait, then pop the mouse down to activate the screen saver via a hot corner.  Even if a delay in activation has been set via the Security system-preference pane, the screen-saver will kick in and the screen will be locked.\r\n\r\nThe fail here is that it requires you to wait at least 10 seconds before you can leave your computer."
