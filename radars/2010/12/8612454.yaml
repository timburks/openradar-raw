    description: "Summary: When playing a song with ipod app on Iphone, if you exit then quit the app, then restart the app it resumes the song from the start, not where left off. Doesn't have this problem with podcasts\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Play any song in the ipod app, remembering where left off \r\n2. press home button. \r\n3. double click home button. \r\n4. scroll to the ipod app, press and hold on the icon until it shakes, then press the ipod app icon again (with the minus sign) to close the app. \r\n5. scroll to the left of the multitasking draw and press the ipod control play button \r\n6. song will not resume where left off, it will begin at start of the song. \r\n7. reproduce above steps with a podcast, and this time it will resume where left off.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Songs should resume where last played them, as per podcasts.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Songs do not resume, they start again at the beginning of the song\r\n\r\nRegression: Have tested with iOS3, and the problem did not exist."
