    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm having an issue with resigning the keyboard in a view that is shown using UIModalPresentationFormSheet. It works fine(keyboard hides) when I use UIModalPresentationPageSheet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPresent a modal view controller using UIModalPresentationFormSheet. Implement the textFieldDidReturn callback on a textfield in the view controller that was presented modally, and call resignFirstResponder on that textField.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nKeyboard should hide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nKeyboard does not hide.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
