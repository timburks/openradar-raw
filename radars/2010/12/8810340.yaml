    description: Xcode autocompletes 'UIUpgradeOtherBundleIdentifier' (as 'Upgrade other bundle identifier' in human-description mode) when editing plist files, but no mention of it can be found in documentation or DevForums. An official explanation of what this key is and does would be appreciated.
