    description: "20-Dec-2010 09:00 AM Niklas Brunberg:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn 1992 software was often small in scope and distribution. In 2010 mass distribution to the whole world is available via The Internet, this allows one developer to target customers and users in USA, Japan, Germany and South Africa alike.\r\n\r\nThis has led to a new kind of problem: Localization. Localization is the process in which multiple text strings (and even graphics) can be included in a software package. The operating system (or browser) can then pick the strings and graphics that corresponds to the user's language settings.\r\n\r\nSafari does not provide any tools for developers to localize content in extensions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Safari extension.\r\nTry to localize.\r\nRealize that this is futile.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ability to localize ones extension.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA single-language extension that does not live up to the quality of normal Mac OS X software.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSafari 5.0.1 to 5.0.3 including the latest WebKit nightly build.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
