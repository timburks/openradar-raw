    description: "I'm thinking about the design for a Mac app that could easily have a companion iPad app.  I would love to do MobileMe syncing, but since Sync Services is Mac-only, that would shackle me to the Mac; I would not be able to sync the data from MobileMe to the iPad.\r\n\r\nAdding this feature could be a double win: app syncing would add value to a MobileMe subscription, and iOS apps could support syncing without developers having to build their own infrastructure.  Both of these are good for Apple's platforms!"
