    description: "Summary:\r\nI can't detect if my openIn menu is already open. Calling presentOpenInMenuFromBarButtonItem:animated: while the menu is open causes drawing problems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a UIToolbar with a UIBarButtonItem.\r\n2. Create a UIDocumentInteractionController with a url to a text document.\r\n3. When the button is tapped, called presentOpenInMenuFromBarButtonItem:animated: on UIDocumentInteractionController object.\r\n4. Run the program and tap on the button. Note that the menu is presented (if you're running on a device that has an app which can handle a text document).\r\n5. Tap the button again.\r\n6. Note that the menu redraws with a slight problem (a bar on the bottom disappears).\r\n7. Swap out the call in your button target and replace it with presentOptionsMenuFromBarButtonItem:animated:.\r\n8. Run the program and tap the button a few times. Notice that the menu redraw issues here are even worse.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would love for the menu to disappear when the button is tapped. However, I would be perfectly fine with the menu just staying exactly the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu redraws with funky issues.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas been happening since 3.2, iirc.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf there was some way to detect that the menu was open, I would just close it when the user tapped the button again. To work around this issue, I am just calling dismissMenuAnimated: before presenting the menu. This gives me the desired behavior of just keeping the menu visible without redraw issues.\r\n\r\nIf I am off on this, please let me know."
