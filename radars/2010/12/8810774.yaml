    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a table view on the screen that is taller than the screen, I also have a text field that is currently the first responder (i.e. the keyboard is visible). I touch a table cell that displays a modal subview. If a memory warning occurs while in the subview then when we return to the parent view the table does not scroll all the way to the bottom. FWIW, if the table was scrolled at all, when we return to the initial table view the table has lost it's scroll position. Also this worked prior to 4.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall the attached project and run the app (I use the simulator so I can simulate a memory warning later, this does occur on device but I don't have a predictable way of producing the memory warning there)\r\nTouch the text input at the top of the screen (you may change the text if you wish)\r\nNow touch one of the table cells (a new instance of the same view is displayed modally)\r\nSimulate a memory warning\r\nScroll to the bottom of the modal subview and touch the done button\r\nWhen you return to the top level view you will not be able to scroll to the bottom of the view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to be able to scroll to the bottom of the top level view when I return to it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not possible to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the view top level view when I return to it\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm uncertain what information you require here?\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has been an issue with my app on the app store since I released Fresh Xpense Capture 1.1 (which supports 4.x). In this application I use a table to host some form elements. Some cells have text entry fields imagine one of these is currently the first responder. One cell when touched displays the camera. On older devices this often triggered a memory warning, even on my iPhone 4 when memory is low this triggers a memory warning. When the user returns from the camera UI they are not able to scroll to the bottom of the entry screen. I have a cell at the bottom of the screen that submits the form when touched. Users were not able to touch this cell. The workaround was to touch the cell that displayed the camera a second time once this was dismissed the scrolling was restored in many cases."
