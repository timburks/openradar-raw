    description: "Mac OS X 10.6 comes with wxPerl preinstalled for perl 5.10, but it is completely unusable on Intel architectures (i386 and x86_64).\r\n\r\n64bit Intel is not built at all, because the wxWindows that comes with OS X lacks 64bit support (see rdar://8737378). This is not a big problem, as one could still use perl in 32bit mode for using wxPerl. But this is not possible either: Executing\r\n\r\nVERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT=yes perl -mWx\r\n\r\nfails with the following error:\r\n\r\nCan't find 'boot_Wx' symbol in /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.10.0/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/Wx/Wx.bundle\r\n\r\nIf this cannot be fixed, I suggest not shipping the module with OS X at all, as this might confuse users.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary workaround, wxPerl can be installed manually with the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1. sudo cpan\r\nor\r\n1. sudo -i cpan\r\n(depends on where you have your .cpan)\r\n2. look Wx\r\n3. perl Makefile.PL\r\n4. make\r\n5. VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT=yes make test\r\n(this should not report any errors)\r\n6. make install\r\n\r\nAfter doing this,\r\n\r\nVERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT=yes perl -mWx\r\n\r\nshould work as expected."
