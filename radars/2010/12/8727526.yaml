    description: "Summary:\r\nI cannot paste into a Safari preferences text field, although I was able to do this in the past (perhaps just once).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType into a Safari text field.\r\nPaste over.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPaste should replace.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's a flicker but field is not updated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI sent this to Marc Hoyois about ClickToFlash.safariextz:\r\n\r\n> \tI tried to paste \"support.oracle.com 140.163.76.187 140.163.76.188 140.163.76.189 140.163.76.190\" into the \"Allow Flash on locations matching:\" field, but it didn't work. I'm pretty sure I've pasted into that field before, and I can type into it, but I cannot paste that whole string (or various substrings I tried).\r\n\r\nMarc's response:\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of this problem, but I can confirm it. Pasting only works if the field is blank. That's not something that I can control, however. It's a Safari bug and you should report it here: http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html. It might be a bug introduced in 5.0.3, if you remember it working before."
