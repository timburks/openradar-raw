    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using MKMapView at small frame sizes, the Google logo becomes too large and extends beyond the full size of the view, as well as practically covers up a good chunk of the map.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an MKMapView of a small frame size. In my case, I'm using a width and height of 60 to try to emulate the map icon in the Maps app when viewing a specific location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Google logo dynamically resizes to proportionally fit the size of the view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Google logo maintains the same sizes regardless of whether the MKMapView takes up the full size of the screen or just this small frame.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. It's the same from 4.0 to 4.2, although on 4.0 and 4.1, the the logo is position in toward the center of the MKMapView than in 4.2. Unable to test on any older OS version, as I don't have those installed.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of bug: http://cl.ly/410f173V3o2h3p1I3T27"
