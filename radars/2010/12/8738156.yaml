    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm attempting to create an in-app purchase of a substantial amount.\r\n\r\nI can create an in-app purchase for tier 79 ($449.99 US).\r\nCreating an in-app purchase for anything tier 80 or greater returns the product ID as invalid in the didReceiveResponse delegate method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Create an in-app purchase in iTunes Connect.\r\n2.  Set the price tier to 80.\r\n3.  Attempt to purchase the item in your application.\r\n4.  Note StoreKit's didReceiveResponse returns the product ID as invalid.\r\n5.  In iTunes Connect, change the price tier to 79.\r\n6.  Attempt to purchase the item in your application.\r\n7.  StoreKit returns the proper product data.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll available price tiers should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPrice tiers at or above tier 80 do not work for in-app purchases.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
