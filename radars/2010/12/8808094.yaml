    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the user logs in with an Apple ID prior to making an in-app purchase, the transaction fails with the following message:\r\n\r\nStore Kit Error\r\nPayment requests are restricted to products returned as valid via Store Kit's didReceiveResponse method. [Environment: Sandbox]\r\n\r\nAs noted in Technical Q&A QA1691, all the products returned in didReceiveResponse are valid at the time [SKPayment paymentWithProduct:YOUR_SKPRODUCT_OBJECT] is used to request payment. Subsequent attempts to purchase the product are successful (since the Apple ID is stored after the first failed purchase).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Prior to launching the app, go to Settings > Store > Sign Out\r\n2. Launch the app and press the \"Buy\" button.\r\n3. Tap \"Buy\" to confirm the purchase.\r\n4. Tap \"Use Existing Apple ID\" and login with a test account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter logging in with an Apple ID & password, the transaction is completed successfully and the product is downloaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user is presented with the aforementioned error and the purchase fails despite the fact that the product is a valid object returned by Apple at the time the payment is requested.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nJust to reiterate, the error only occurs when the user must sign-in with an Apple ID prior to making a purchase. All subsequent in-app purchase attempts complete successfully. Other developers are experiencing the same problem as described in this developer forum thread: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/69875?tstart=0"
