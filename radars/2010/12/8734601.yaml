    description: "Summary:\r\nI just did an \"AdViewController\" (inheriting from UIViewController) that has the basic UIViewAnimation things for when the Ad is loaded or an error. It's pretty much boiler plate. I also have a \"contentView\" which is where the \"banner view\" is integrated and I have the AdBanner added which \"NSClassFromString\" with a weak linked framework to be able to have the app run on OS 3 devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust create a \"common\" App with iAd.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a \"AdViewController\" as a building block, with some properties like \"load from bottom or top\" and \"animation duration\", and the typical checks in the delegate methods.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne have to write a bunch of boiler plate \"frame\"/\"animation\"/\"delegate\" code to have it work \"nicely\"."
