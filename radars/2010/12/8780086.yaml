    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCreating a borderless child window and displaying it causes the order for Cycle Windows to break.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly bad for Google Chrome because we often create child windows and the user can get stuck in a situation where Command-` simply toggles between two windows.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've attached a simple application to reproduce this bug. You can reproduce this in any app that opens child windows. For example, in Safari do the following:\r\n1. Open 4 Safari Windows.\r\n2. Use Command-` to cycle between windows and note the order.\r\n3. Mouse over a bookmark in the bookmark bar and wait until a tooltip is shown.\r\n4. Use Command-` to cycle between windows, note that the order is now different than 2.\r\n\r\nIn Google Chrome do the following:\r\n1. Open 4 chrome windows.\r\n2. Mouse over a link.\r\n3. Use Command-` to cycle between windows. Notice that you can get stuck in a situation where you simply cycle between two windows.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOpening a borderless child window shouldn't change the Cycle Window behavior. Specially if the child window has NSWindowCollectionBehaviorIgnoresCycle set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOpening a child window changes the Cycle Window behavior.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDon't know.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a sample app to demonstrate this problem."
