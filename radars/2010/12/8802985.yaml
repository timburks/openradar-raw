Build and run the example project (attached).\r\n2. The device will show a view with title, playback position, and a \"Switch\" button. The first song in the library will automatically start playing.\r\n3. Note the playback position this song starts at (say t1).\r\n4. Let the song play for a little while, say 10 seconds.\r\n5. Tap the \"Switch\" button.\r\n6. The player will switch to the second song in the library. Note the playback position (say t2).\r\n7. Let this song play for a little while too, say 5 seconds.\r\n8. Tap the \"Switch\" button again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPlayback position for the first song should now be t1 + 10. Switching back to the other song should set the playback position to t2 + 5.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPlayback position jumps back to t1 whenever the songs are switched, regardless of how long they're played.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have tested this on an iPhone 3G running iOS 4.2.1 and on an iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.1. Both devices fail the test. However, running this test on an iPod Touch (2nd generation) running iOS 4.0 produces the expected results: playback position is maintained correctly for each song.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is limited to using MPMusicPlayerController, using either the applicationMusicPlayer or the iPodMusicPlayer. When playing songs in the iPod player, playback time is maintained correctly."
