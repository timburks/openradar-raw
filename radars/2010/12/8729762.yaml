    description: "Summary:\r\nChanging the tintColor of the UINavigationBar for the master view of a UISplitViewController gives some unexpected results. The tintColor is applied if the master view is only viewed in landscape. As soon as the popover is opened in portrait, the tintColor is ignored, even in landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with a split view. The default \"Split View-based Application\" template will do.\r\n2. Customize the color of the master view's toolbar, for example: self.navigationController.navigationBar.tintColor = [UIColor redColor];\r\n3. Run the app. (Both the simulator and device have the same issue.)\r\n4. View the app in portrait, without opening the popover. Note that the tintColor is applied.\r\n5. Rotate the device to portrait.\r\n6. Tap the button to display the master view in a popover.\r\n7. Rotate the device to landscape. Note that the tintColor is no longer applied.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tintColor should always be applied in landscape view. (Understandably, it is ignored inside the popover, since the navigation bar blends into the popover itself.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tintColor is only sometimes applied in landscape view. If the app is launched in landscape, or rotated to landscape before opening the popover, then the color is applied. After the popover is opened, it is no longer applied.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue was not present on iOS 3.2. However on 3.2 the navigation bar's tintColor was applied even in the popover, which wasn't ideal either.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can test this bug yourself just by creating a new project with the \"Split View-based Application\" template, then adding \"self.navigationController.navigationBar.tintColor = [UIColor redColor];\" to viewDidLoad in RootViewController.m."
