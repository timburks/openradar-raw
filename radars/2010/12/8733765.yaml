    description: "06-Dec-2010 11:35 AM Steven Fisher:\r\nSummary:\r\nReachability 2.2 does not compile with Xcode 3.2.5 for Mac OS X 10.6 and iOS 4.2 because it is linked directly to the 4.0 SDK. The next release should be modified to use the latest SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Reachability sample.\r\n2. Build with latest Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould build.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan't build, because it uses latest SDK.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm sure you guys are already tracking this and have a fix planned, but I hit this today and thought I'd file this to get an extra vote to ship the new Reachability sooner rather than later. :)"
