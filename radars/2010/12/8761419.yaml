    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a small HTML5 app that uses the <audio> tag to stream radios. It's at http://github.com/stuffmc/rplite (download the HTML on a mac and call it from a device - with Web Sharing).\r\n\r\nIn Safari, I can leave Safari and the audio will continue to play.\r\n\r\nIf I make this a standalone web app (apple-mobile-web-app-capable) it's not anymore audio background capable :(\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload the HTML, access it from a device, add it to the home screen, start a stream (wait for it to work - some are yet not working, work in progress)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio should continue to play in background just like in Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio stops, old school, like with iPhone OS 3.x\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHaving a \"Web capable\" app working not as good as when called in Safari is a huge regression :("
