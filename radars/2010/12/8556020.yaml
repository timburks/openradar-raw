    description: "Summary: \r\nOpenAL alGetSourcei() with AL_SOURCE_STATE returns AL_STOPPED when sound is playing\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Set up OpenAL sound with RAM based buffer\r\n- Play the sound with alSourcePlay()\r\n- Stop the sound *before* it finishes by issuing alSourceStop() As per the OpenAL docs, \"The stopped source will have its state changed to AL_STOPPED\".\r\n- Now start the sound again with alSourcePlay() and immediately check the state, it will be AL_STOPPED where the documentation says: \"The playing source will have its state changed to AL_PLAYING\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe playing source will have its state changed to AL_PLAYING\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe playing source will have its state changed to AL_STOPPED\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis could be related to this issue:\r\n\r\nhttp://old.nabble.com/Mac-alSourceRewind-bug-td28224584.html\r\n\r\nThe second message contains a response from Apple Engineer Bob Aron.\r\n\r\nI see the issue on iPad and MacOS X 10.6.4\r\nI can whip up a sample project if you need this confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n05-Nov-2010 11:26 \r\nUploading an XCode project that clearly exhibits the problems in the bugreport... and more...\r\n\r\n04-Dec-2010 06:20 \r\n'OpenALbugiOS.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n04-Dec-2010 06:20 PM\r\nAlthough it seems an engineer has done some \"work\" on the second issue I mention (sounds never returning to AL_INITIAL), the real problems still exist. Even worse, iOS 4 introduces more OpenAL state bugs. See my new (iOS) demo app for information. Basically: triggering some OpenAL calls in sequence can really get the state off, but can lead to faulty behavior (a sound starts playing which has been paused). This is *REALLY* bad!\r\n\r\nDemo projects:\r\nMac: http://pimz.com/bugs/OpenALbug.zip\r\niOS: http://pimz.com/bugs/OpenALbugiOS.zip"
