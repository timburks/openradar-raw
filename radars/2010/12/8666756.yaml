    description: "Summary:\r\nCTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraints returns a size that does not actually fit the entire input text (despite the constraint size being more than big enough to fit it), and a range that claims it did.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have some text.\r\n2. Have a size you want to fit to the text.\r\n3. Call CTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraints.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou get a size that completely fits the text as tightly as possible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get a size that fits the first two lines of the text.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTest app included. The current output is:\r\n\r\n2010-11-14 11:45:55.675 whatthirdline[2929:903] Input size {291, 1.79769e+308} -> output size {283.037, 37.3359}\r\n2010-11-14 11:45:55.677 whatthirdline[2929:903] Fit: 100; complete length: 100\r\n\r\nBoth outputs are wrong; the height given is too short to fit all 100 characters. Either the height should be taller, or (if the function *insists* on giving me too short of a size) the range should be shorter.\r\n\r\nI'll also include a screenshot, showing the same code's output being used in the real app, with an Xscope measurement rectangle over it. (The rectangle would not go any smaller than 42 points tall; neither the height returned by the function nor this height is big enough to fit the whole text.)\r\n\r\n[I'm not going to include the screenshot in this OpenRadar edition because it is out of context without the test app.]"
