    description: "Summary:\r\nLike (I guess) other developers having an app playing audio (in my case a radio & podcast streaming app) I'm pausing the sound when displaying the ad (when the banner is clicked - bannerViewActionShouldBegin:willLeaveApplication:). When this Ad doesn't have audio, tough, it makes no sense to pause the audio :( I'd like to get a hint that there *is* audio in this Ad, to decide - or better, just pause (and resume) my audio for me :)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave an audio, pause it in bannerViewActionShouldBegin:willLeaveApplication: - if the Ad displayed have no audio, it's a pitty *my* audio was paused.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither give a hint in bannerViewActionShouldBegin:willLeaveApplication: or do the pause & resume job for us :)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI'm pausing and resuming the audio, even if the Ad has no audio :("
