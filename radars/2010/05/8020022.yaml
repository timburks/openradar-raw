    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to exclude the data for the Software Update service located at /private/var/db/swupd from backups using the Time Machine preference pane, the path is changed to /var/db/swupd and the directory is still backed up. A workaround exists by editing the com.apple.TimeMachine.plist configuration file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Exclude /private/var/db/swupd or /var/db/swupd from backups using the Time Machine preference pane.\r\n2. Perform a Time Machine backup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe directory located at /private/var/db/swupd is not backed up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA backup is made of /private/var/db/swupd.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nManually changing the path /var/db/swupd to /private/var/db/swupd in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist fixes the problem."
