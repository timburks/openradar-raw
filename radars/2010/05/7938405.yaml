    description: "Summary:\r\nVideo.app display is inadequate.\r\n\r\nMovies tab should show duration.\r\nSome movies (notably Brick Lane clips, ripped from DVD via Handbrake) lack stills in the listing view -- instead they just show black/grey gradients.\r\n\r\nTV Shows do not show title (either Show or even Album).\r\nTV Shows should also show included Seasons.\r\nTV Shows should show number of episodes in each stack.\r\n\r\nPodcast stacks should show number of episodes.\r\n\r\nAll stacks (Movies, TV Shows, & Podcasts) should show a watch/unwatched/partial indicator as episodes do one level down.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCopy Movies, TV Shows, & Podcasts to an iPod.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould have much more information about content from top levels.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMovies, TV Shows, & Podcasts show inadequate information.\r\nIn particular, my shows (downloaded from TiVo) often only show stills from ads, making them impossible to distinguish from the top level.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBoth iPhone's iPod.app and iTunes show much more information at the top level."
