    description: "I'm using some saved Application Data from an earlier version of my iPhone/iPad application to test the upgrade process. Each time I reinstall, I need to remove the old app, install it via Xcode without running it, drag on my saved Application Data, and then build & debug it, which installs the application a second time.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could select some pre-downloaded Application Data to be installed with the application when I build & run it. This could be selected in a similar manner to specifying arguments and environment variables."
