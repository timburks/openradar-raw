    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode's file browser on the left of the main window can be resized horizontally, but has no scroller in its panes. The contents are simply truncated on the right. Once a project gets above a few dozen files, especially when long filenames are used, the indentation caused by nesting becomes inconvenient. Above 150 files it's very hard to use because the useful information in the file names is often at the right side and truncated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd nested file structure to Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll files are browsable with a horizontal as well as a vertical scroller for each pane.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo horizontal scroller is present.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll versions of Xcode are affected.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
