    description: "28-May-2010 11:26 PM Walter Meyer:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen computer is bound to Active Directory and Open Directory, with the Active Directory plugin set to use UNC path from Active Directory to derive network home location and to create a Mobile Account on login, and portable home directory sync preferences set in Open Directory (MCX set to sync default items and preferences) upon user login an error message appears when an AD user logs in saying: \"Home Directory cannot be synced at this time \"Cancel\" or \"Continue\". If \"Continue\" is pressed user logs in. Even when trying to manually sync the home directory it is unsuccessful. Nothing is synced. The home directory is able to be mounted and written to manually.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBind Mac to Active Directory and Open Directory, with the Active Directory plugin set to use UNC path from Active Directory to derive network home location and to create a Mobile Account on login. Set portable home directory sync preferences in Open Directory. MCX set to sync default items and preferences.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHome Directory should mount and PHD sync settings should be followed and users home directory should be synced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError message appears saying: \"Home Directory cannot be synced at this time \"Cancel\" or \"Continue\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n01-Jun-2010 03:37 PM Walter Meyer:\r\nI have my client bound to OD and AD (Golden Triangle). I have the AD plugin on the client set to 'Use UNC path from AD to derive network home location' and to create a mobile account on login. I have Mobility Home and Preference sync turned on in OD for the client and the defaults set. When I try to login with an AD user the Home Directory sync fails completely with errors in the log.\r\n\r\nMy ~/Library/FileSyncAgent-verbose.log as some errors in it, this error in particular seems to be causing the problem.\r\n\r\n1:: [10/06/01 15:19:45.779] Peer \"network\" is unable to sync. (EnsureSSHKeysConfigured (sshkeygen.m:309): \"'(([fm removeItemOnlyIfItExistsAtPath:remoteHomeFileSyncKeyDir error:&err]))' error Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=512 UserInfo=0x1030a4b60 \"“FileSyncAgent_key_dir” couldn’t be removed.\"\")\r\n\r\nNow if I browse to my Network home directory the /Library/FileSync/FileSyncAgent_key_dir exists but it isn't visible even if I do an 'ls -a' on it in terminal. I know it is there because if I try to manually create a folder called FileSyncAgent_key_dir Finder says it exists. So based on the error I thought perhaps the client can't perform the actions it needs to on that directory (why? permissions are fine I think as I can create files in the directory manually fine), so I copied the FileSyncAgent_key_dir from the home directory on the client and put it on the Network Home. Now when I try to sync the sync works. But when I try to sync a second time it fails again with the same error. So for some reason the permissions are getting set incorrectly on this directory, perhaps by FileSync Agent on the client."
