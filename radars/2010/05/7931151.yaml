    description: "01-May-2010 12:59 PM Chris Donnelly:\r\n'Kernel_2010-04-25-223002_octosaurus.panic' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n01-May-2010 12:59 PM Chris Donnelly:\r\nSummary:\r\nI have frequent kernel panics (sometimes several times a day) that I have narrowed down to pretty much the only consistent factor: the drivers for my Microsoft Natural Keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have not found a 100% surefire sequence to reproduce, but this is pretty much the most consistent pattern:\r\n 1. Open a decent number of programs.  Typically I will have Xcode, Aptana, Firefox, and several other various small programs open.\r\n 2. It always happens while I am typing, particularly if the typing involves a key combination (or my fat-fingering a key, etc.).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKernel panic screen fades in from the top, and I have to reboot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not happen when I used the standard Mac keyboard.\r\nDid not happen on my work Mac when I controlled the machine using Synergy served from my Windows PC, furthering my suspicions that it is the keyboard driver.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am able to reproduce this on two separate Mac Pro workstations with identical hardware configurations late last year:\r\n 1. My work Mac, which I bought at the Apple Store in town for an iPhone project.  Started out with Leopard 10.5 but I used the upgrade disk to upgrade it to Snow Leopard.  12GB of RAM (6x2GB DIMMs).\r\n 2. My home Mac, which I bought so I could work at home on the project.  Due to depleting the local Apple Store of 2GB DIMMs, I ordered it online.  It came with Snow Leopard preinstalled.  Otherwise, the configurations are identical.\r\n\r\nI use Microsoft Natural Keyboards (specifically the 4000) not only on both Macs, but also on my home and work Windows machines, because I develop severe wrist pain within a week of using any other keyboard.  This includes the standard-issue Apple USB keyboards that came with both my Mac Pro workstations, which I attempted to use in good faith for a week or so before the wrist pain began.\r\n\r\nI have reported virtually all of said crashes to Apple, so please do not hesitate to let me know if you need further information (e.g. hardware info to correlate to).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n# Chris\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2010 04:10 PM (name redacted):\r\nEngineering believes this issue has been addressed in Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.4.  \r\n\r\nThis should no longer occur with the latest version of Snow Leopard and the latest drivers from Microsoft.\r\n\r\nPlease verify with this release, and update this report with your results.\r\nMac OS X 10.6.4:\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1048\r\nDate Posted: June 15th, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nI have been able to type on my home Mac for several sessions with 10.6.4 and have not encountered a kernel panic."
