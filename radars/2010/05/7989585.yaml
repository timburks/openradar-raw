    description: "16-May-2010 12:40 AM Rory O’Kane:\r\n'iTunes freeze Activity Monitor samples.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n16-May-2010 12:40 AM Rory O’Kane:\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes, the scrolling artist/album display at the top of the iTunes windows causes iTunes to hang temporarily when it scrolls. It can happen when a command is issued to iTunes at the same time, or on its own.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start playing a song.\r\n2. Wait until the artist/album display at the top of the window starts scrolling to the other value.\r\n3. Press Space.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe song pauses, the animation finishes, and iTunes is responsive for further commands.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe song continues playing. The animation freezes mid-scroll. iTunes does not respond to keyboard or mouse events. The cursor turns into the rainbow wait cursor. Ten seconds later (after the display starts to scroll again), iTunes unfreezes and the song pauses (from the previous Space press).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem has happened ever since I got my MacBook Pro in summer 2009 – it did not happen on my previous iMac. I have not tested this on any other computers.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExecuting these steps above sometimes successfully pauses the song. However, most of the time, pressing space immediately afterwards does not unpause the song, and causes iTunes to freeze.\r\n\r\nThis freeze happens with situations other than pressing Space. Selecting another song with the arrow keys or mouse, switching to a playlist, or executing a script from the script menu, for example, can all cause this freeze. After the freeze ends, the buffered commands execute, even multiple actions.\r\n\r\niTunes does not freeze every time the display scrolls, or every time it scrolls and a button is pressed. From memory, I think iTunes also sometimes freezes for two scrolls in a row. A few times, iTunes froze on launch, so the scrolling display may not be the whole cause of this problem.\r\n\r\nQuitting and relaunching iTunes never had any effect.\r\n\r\nAttached is an Activity Monitor sample of when iTunes is frozen right after executing the Steps to Reproduce. Towards the end of the sample-taking, iTunes unfroze, so some information might be extraneous. I have also collected other samples in the past, and those are attached as well. The folder also contains a description of another time I could reproduce the problem that I sent in the force quit comments box a month ago.\r\n\r\nIn case it's relevant: I have 11559 items in my Music library. I also have about 150 playlists (I have one for each collection of related albums)."
