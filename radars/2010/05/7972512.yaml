    description: "Summary:\r\nI present a modal view in a split view.\r\n\r\nIf I'm in portrait view when I dismiss the modal view, splitViewController:willHideViewController:withBarButtonItem:forPopoverController: will be called. However, If I'm  in landscape view when I dismiss the modal view splitViewController:willShowViewController:invalidatingBarButtonItem: will NOT be called.\r\n\r\nSo, if I call up the modal view in portrait mode, change to landscape mode and dismiss it, the popover button will still be in the toolbar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPresent a modal view in portrait mode from a split view, change to landscape mode and dismiss it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsplitViewController:willShowViewController:invalidatingBarButtonItem is called when dismissing a modal view in landscape mode, just as its counterpart splitViewController:willHideViewController:withBarButtonItem:forPopoverController: is called when dismissing a modal view in portrait mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
