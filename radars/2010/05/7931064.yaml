    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen handling user interface rotations on a view controller for an external screen, the meanings of Portrait and Landscape are flipped (given a screen which has portrait as its normal orientation, which almost all have)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn your iPad sideways into landscape mode\r\n2. Add a UIViewController's view to a window displayed on a secondary screen\r\n2. (Optional) In this view controller, implement shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation like so:\r\n- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation {\r\n\tif(UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(interfaceOrientation))\r\n\t\treturn YES;\r\n\treturn NO;\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The contents of the secondary screen is shown in landscape mode (that is, right-side-up when displayed on a normal 4:3 or 16:9/16:10 display)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. The contents of the secondary screen is shown in portrait mode (that is, on its side)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSomeone has assumed that \"0° rotation\"/\"no rotation\" means \"portrait\" and 90° landscape. While this is correct for the iPad's internal display, it's incorrect for almost all other displays, particularly those connected via VGA:\r\n\r\nWriting the code flipped/incorrectly (using UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait(interfaceOrientation) when you mean landscape) works as a workaround."
