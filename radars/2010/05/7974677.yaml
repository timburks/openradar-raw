    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt is not possible using any current API, as of the shipping version of OpenAL.framework (1.3) in Mac OS X 10.6.3, to progmatically capture audio data rendered by OpenAL. The suggested solution is to implement an Apple OpennAL extension that provides a callback API to applications that wish to capture rendered data, in the spirit of OpenGL's glCopyPixels() API. My understanding of the CoreAudio architecture suggests it would be trivial to implement this by inserting an audio unit at the head of the rendering stream whose render callback was the application-supplied pointer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a lack in OpenAL's API and has existed in all versions of both OpenAL and Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
