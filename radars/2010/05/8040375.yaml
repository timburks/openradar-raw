    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running Snow Leopard 10.6.3 10D578 connected to a satellite-based internet connection, DNS queries sometimes fail, preventing numerous internet-reliant apps, especially Safari 4.0.5 (6531.22.7), from resolving named hosts, causing failed connections.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a Mac running Snow Leopard 10.6.3 10D578 to the Internet via a satellite-based connection, such as Hughesnet.\r\n2. Open Safari 4.0.5 (6531.22.7)\r\n3. Use Safari to open a typical web page, like apple.com\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the page to load and open, as allowed by the connection\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes it fails, reporting that Safari \"could not locate\" apple.com, in particular meaning that it could not translate apple.com into a numerical address.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDoes not occur on any version of Leopard, only Snow Leopard. Tested on a MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Intel Core Duo.  Occurs more often with an intervening Airport connection, but also occurs when directly connecting via Ethernet.  \r\n\r\nRestarting Safari and reloading apple.com usually results in a successful page load.  The problem is sporadic, but can be exacerbated by opening numerous disparate web pages at once.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen running ping to the Hughesnet DNS 66.82.4.8, it reports a ping time roughly 600 to 900 ms.  But about one out of ten ping packets is reported as timed out, but then arrives with a total time of at least 1400 ms.  Much more rarely the packet indeed never comes back.  \r\n\r\nBy adding several valid entries to the DNS list in Network System Preferences, say with Google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 and others, the symptom in Safari happened much less often.  I also added StrictUnicastOrdering true in com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist, but that seemed to have a lesser effect.  \r\n\r\nMy speculation is that use of DNS in Snow Leopard interprets the occasional delay of returned packets as a failed DNS, even though merely waiting longer would in fact obtain the correct answer.  By adding several DNSs, Snow Leopard does not see any one DNS give delayed packets and spreads the load, so it's less likely to give up on any one DNS.  \r\n\r\nI would hope that in testing Snow Leopard, one can try connecting to a network whose typical ping time is at least 800 ms, and randomly add an extra delay.  This satellite-based internet connection is a real-world situation, while it may be possible simulate that with a hacked router."
