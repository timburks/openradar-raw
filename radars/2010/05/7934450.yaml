    description: "03-May-2010 08:19 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nBackup 3.2 creates an event log each time it performs a backup.\r\nFor example, this is an event log for a plan backing up to iDisk:\r\n\r\nConnected to MobileMe\r\nBegin backup at 2010-04-24 21:43:05.081 +0200\r\nScanning files...\r\nAcquired a destination for the backup.\r\nCopied file /Utenti/xfox/Documenti/Test\r\nEnd backup at 2010-04-24 21:43:33.137 +0200\r\n\r\nAs you notice, the log states that the \"/Utenti/xfox/Documenti/Test\" file has been backed up. The problem is that it doesn't report the file extension. In fact, the \"Test\" file is actually \"Test.txt\".\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n 1. Create a simple text file with some garbage text in it and save it to the user's Documents folder.\r\n 2. Make sure that the \"Hide extension\" checkbox is checked in the \"Name and Extension\" section of the Finder's Info window for the file created on step 1.\r\n 3. Open Backup and click the + (plus) button to create a new plan.\r\n 4. Choose \"Custom\" from the list of templates that appears.\r\n 5. Type a name for the plan (for example, \"Test\") and press Return.\r\n 6. Click the + (plus) button in the \"Backup Items\" area and choose to include in the plan the text file you created on step 1.\r\n 7. Click the + (plus) button in the \"Destination and Schedule\" area and choose iDisk as the destination of the backup.\r\n 8. Close the window by clicking the red x circle in the upper left corner of the window.\r\n 9. Click \"Back Up\" in the main Backup window.\r\n10. When the backup has been performed, click Plan --> History in the menu bar to open the plan's events list.\r\n11. Double click on the more recent event in the list to open the corresponding log file.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe log file showed by Console.app should report the extension of the file backed up.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe log file showed by Console.app doesn't report the extension of the file backed up.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBackup reports the file name exactly as it's displayed by Finder.app when the backup is performed. Thus, if the \"Hide extension\" checkbox is not checked in the \"Name and Extension\" section of the Finder's Info window for the file that's being backed up, the log file will report both the name and the extension of the file backed up.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug could be very confusing if many files with same name and different extensions would be stored in the same folder and set to be backed up by the same Backup's plan. In case of an error that prevents some of these files to be successfully backed up, by reading the event log there would be no way to distinguish the files correctly backed up from the other files. Thus, the event log would be useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 04:39 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis is a very old report, and much has changed since it was filed.
