    description: "Summary:\r\nThe OpenAL alc APIs do not return the actual list of available devices on a Mac OS X system, making it impossible for OpenAL applications to offer any control over the routing of their audio output.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nALCchar *devices = alcGetString(NULL, ALC_DEVICE_SPECIFIER);\r\nfor ( ; *devices; devices += strlen(devices) + 1)\r\n printf(\"%s\\n\", devices);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuilt-in Output\r\nSoundflower (2ch)\r\n...other devices here...\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuilt-in Output\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTo my knowledge this problem has existed in all versions of OpenAL implemented in Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is classified as a UI/Usability problem, not an enhancement request, as Apple has violated the OpenAL 1.1 specification, section 6.3.7, which states, quote:\r\n\r\n\"An alcGetString query of ALC_DEVICE_SPECIFIER or ALC_CAPTURE_DEVICE_SPECIFIER with a NULL device passed in will return a list of available devices.  Each device name will be separated by a single NULL character and the list will be terminated with two NULL characters.\"\r\n\r\nAs published at the URL <http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Documentation/OpenAL%201.1%20Specification.htm>. On Mac OS X, OpenAL returns only a single device (\"Built-in Output\") regardless of the availability of devices on the user's computer. Passing a different device name to alcOpenDevice() also has no effect.\r\n\r\nThe CoreAudio API provides a complete list of devices via the kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices property of the audio system object."
