    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen displaying document types (as of Technical Q&A QA1630), there is a problem when loading certain files that don't have an extension. We're downloading files from a API of one of our clients. The files are downloaded through a download script, and the filename is therefore not a part of the URL. This works perfectly for almost all files, including PPT, DOC, DOCX, PDF, and so on. But not for PPTX.\r\n\r\nSample URL to get the idea:\r\nhttp://api.client.com/download?session=1234-1234-1234&file=1234\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWith a UIWebView, open up a PPTX-file with file extension:\r\n[documentView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.appcorn.se/sample.pptx\"]]];\r\n\r\nThen load the same file but without extension:\r\n[documentView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.appcorn.se/sample\"]]];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOn both requests, the file should be displayed the same way, just as it does with for example DOCX or PDF.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe first request succeeds without problems, the second request fails with error:\r\nError Domain=WebKitErrorDomain Code=102 UserInfo=0x4d972b0 \"Frame load interrupted\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe download script mentioned in the summary supplies the web request with the correct filename in the response headers and downloading a file from OSX Safari results in a filename.pptx-file. The behavior of UIWebView when opening files without extension isn't described in the documentation (with exception of the legacy iWork formats, for example .pages.zip).\r\n\r\nI'm simply suggesting that this is a bug, because all other file types works as I expected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'll leave two copies of a the same sample PPTX-file (from http://openxmldeveloper.org/) on my server:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.appcorn.se/sample.pptx\r\nhttp://www.appcorn.se/sample"
