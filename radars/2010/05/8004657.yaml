    description: "19-May-2010 05:24 PM Lucius Kwok:\r\nSummary: Playlists which contain items which are podcasts do not show up when calling MediaPlayer's [[MPMediaQuery podcastsQuery] collections]. The playlist has both a music item and a podcast item. In iTunes, in the device's view, the playlist is checked in both the Music->Playlists section and in the Podcasts->Include Episodes from Playlists section. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. In iTunes, create a playlist \"Podcast\" with one music item and with one podcast episode. \r\n2. Connect iPad or iPhone to your computer and select it in iTunes.\r\n3. In the Music tab of the device, select \"Sync Music\" and \"Selected palyists, artists, and genres\". In the \"Playlists:\" section, put a checkmark next to the \"Podcast\" playlist created above.\r\n4. In the Podcasts tab of the dvice, select \"Sync Podcasts\" and \"Automatically include all unplayed episodes of all podcasts.\" Scroll down to the \"Include Episodes from Playlists:\" section and put a checkmark next to the \"Podcast\" playlist created above.\r\n5. Open the iPod app on the device to verify that the \"Podcast\" playlist exists and contains the two items.\r\n6. In Xcode, build and run the attached TestMPMediaQuery project. \r\n7. Note that the \"Podcast\" playlist is missing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The \"Podcast\" playlist should show up in the list of playlists returned by calling [[MPMediaQuery podcastsQuery] collections];\r\n\r\nActual Results: The \"Podcast\" playlist is missing from the list of playlists. This bug appears on the iPhone 3GS running OS 3.1.3 and iPad WiFi running OS 3.2. \r\n\r\nRegression: None\r\n\r\nNotes: This might be related to another bug where podcasts do not show up at all from MPMediaQuery or the OS-provided media picker. Running the attached project on the iPhone 3GS/3.1.3 results in no items returned for the [[MPMediaQuery podcastsQuery] collections] call. On the iPad/3.2, the podcasts query returns all podcasts."
