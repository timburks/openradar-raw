    description: "10-Dec-2008 02:50 PM Hal Mueller:\r\nPlease provide an API to allow iPhone to connect to Bluetooth serial profile devices.\r\n\r\nMy use case is to connect serial port devices to the iPhone for data logging and processing, using a device like the IOGear GBS301 Serial Adapter. This would make many marine electronics applications possible.\r\n\r\nA similar functionality is available using Wifi/serial adapters, but WiFi requires much more power from the iPhone and makes this approach not as attractive."
