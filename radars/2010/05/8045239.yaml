    description: "31-May-2010 05:48 PM Roman Busyghin:\r\nSummary:\r\nUIScrollView and its subclasses won't bounce if they are nested into custom UIView. Scroll view starts bouncing when it is nested into plain UIView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample code and try to make scroll view bouncing by dragging it to the one of its edges\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIScrollView should bounce normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt won't bounce\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProblem exists in both 3.1.3 and 4.0. To workaround this problem you should put additional UIView between custom UIView and your UIScrollView.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
