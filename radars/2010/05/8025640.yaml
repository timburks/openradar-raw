    description: "Summary:\r\nCannot enable alphanumeric passcodes without requiring passcode. I want to use a stronger-than-4-digit passcode for my iPhone, but sometimes I need to disable it briefly, as when my wife is handling GPS on a trip, when it would be unsafe for me to unlock the phone with a strong password while driving.\r\n\r\nTo use a strong passcode, I must create a mandatory passcode policy in iPCU and apply it to the iPhone, which means I cannot temporarily disable it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch Settings.\r\nLook for passcode strength settings.\r\n\r\nLaunch iPhone Configuration Utility.\r\nCreate a new configuration policy.\r\nOpen passcode policies.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to select alphanumeric passcodes directly on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nIn iPCU, should be able to enable alphanumeric passcodes without requiring them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhone has no passcode strength configuration.\r\n\r\niPCU cannot enable strong passcodes without requiring them."
