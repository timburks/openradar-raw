    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe current value of the TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY build setting is not passed to GCC.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Add the following preprocessor code to some iPhone OS source code:\r\n\r\n#if TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY == 1\r\n\r\n#warning \"iPhone target\"\r\n\r\n#else\r\n\r\n#warning \"iPad target\"\r\n\r\n#endif\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAt compile time, you'd see \"iPhone target\" or \"iPad target\" logged to the build results depending on the setting of the TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\"iPad target\" is logged regardless of the setting.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNot known. Building different targets for different versions of the iPhone OS has only recently become and issue :-)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis workaround for this problem is to create a Preprocessor Macro build setting with:\r\n\r\nTARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=$(TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY)"
