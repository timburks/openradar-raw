    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA 3rd party plugin rendering a consumer patch, using an input image fails to have its image input be set properly within an iterator of more than 1 iteration.\r\nExpected results:\r\nWith any number of iterations, the image updates as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the included XCode project to build and copy, and load the included composition. Set the number of iterations to 1 and change the published index port to select the input image. Note that the image rendered changes.\r\n\r\nNow change the number of iterations to 2, and note that the image does not change; it stays locked on the last working input image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nRegardless of the number of iterations, the image changes to reflect the actual image passed to the iterator to the consumer patch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAny iteration number other than 1 results in the image not being updated.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWorks as expected in 10.5.8, so I think this is a 10.6 iterator issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNote this behavior works regardless of consumer plugin, as long as it is using the 3rd party API. We have been able to reproduce with Apples provided \"GL Heighfield\" plugin, as well as many of our own 3rd party plugins.\r\n\r\nAttached/included in this bug report is a zip file containing an XCode project of a basic consumer renderer with an image input (similar to a simple sprite patch). Also in the zip file is a bug report composition that demonstrates the issue."
