Open the iPod app and select the Podcasts tab to make sure that podcasts are on the iPhone.\r\n3. In Xcode, build and run the attached TestMPMediaQuery project. \r\n4. Note that it shows \"Podcats: (No items)\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results: All podcasts on the device should be returned by the [[MPMediaQuery podcastsQuery] collections]; call.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No podcasts are returned. \r\n\r\nRegression: This bug appears on the iPhone 3GS running OS 3.1.3 but not on iPad WiFi running OS 3.2.
