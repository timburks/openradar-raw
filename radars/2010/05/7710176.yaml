    description: "Summary: \r\nWhenever you begin to send a message in the iPhone OS Messages app and then scroll the content of previous threaded messages the progress bar hangs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Compose a new message, either SMS or MMS in the Messages app.\r\n2.) Tap the Send button.\r\n3.) While the progress bar is updating, scroll the previous message content in the scroll view located above the keyboard. Make sure that you continue to keep you finger on the scroll view. The progress bar doesn't need to be on the main thread where the scroll events are. The scroll view is blocking the updating of the progress bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the progress bar to continue to update even when I scroll\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe progress bar doesn't update. It hangs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways occurs. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone."
