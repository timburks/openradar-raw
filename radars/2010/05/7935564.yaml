    description: "03-May-2010 08:31 PM Toby Harris:\r\nHaving macros available across the system is nice and all, but beyond having a number splitter preset to 0-1 and a few other things, everything I use a virtual macro for is highly project specific, ie. contained to one composition. Having to use a feature that relies on an external filesystem, quitting and reloading QC.app to pick up changes, that doesn't let me inspect the contents of the macro... its just been designed backwards from how I find myself using it.\r\n\r\nAlso, and in this I'm probably more alone, if you use virtual patches held in the bundle of in a Cocoa+QCRenderer application, the whole authoring system breaks and can only be fixed by judicious use of sym-links.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see something within QC.app that allows you to just copy a macro as another instance of that macro. Double click on any of them, and you go in and edit them all. From my perspective, that could even be the default, how qc works, and you could subsequently think to break it away as a standalone macro if you need.\r\n\r\nLeave virtual macros as they are. Bring in an independent new feature scoped within compositions themselves, where copied macros are clones. No conflict between these two worlds, and the existing 'save flattened' (or whatever its called) option could be used to unroll the instance'd 10.7 .qtz file.\r\n\r\nIMHO this will make authoring in qc much much simpler and faster for novices and power users alike. just make that the way qc works, and the mental overhead currently required in thinking about these things drops to zero. you wouldn't even need to provide the extra complexity of a 'break link' command, as you could just select all, copy and paste the contents of the macro into wherever else you want them (ie. an empty macro)."
