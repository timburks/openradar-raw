    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen option-double-clicking a symbol in Xcode, it fails to find any information about the symbol if it is not in the current project’s index, instead presenting a badly-worded error message.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new command-line project, subtype “C”.\r\n* In main(), add the line: Gestalt(); (note that the relevant framework header is not included)\r\n* Option-double-click the word “Gestalt”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA synopsis of the Gestalt() function.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n“Cannot determine the symbol for the current selection.”\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPrevious versions of Xcode were able to find documentation by the advanced high-tech method of searching for the selected string. New versions should be able to fall back on this behaviour.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUnsurprisingly, this behaviour happens for all symbols when no project is open.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly aggravating that the “Show information for this symbol in documentation window” button is disabled in the error pop-up, since that button presents the same UX as the old implementation. You know, the one that quite consistently worked."
