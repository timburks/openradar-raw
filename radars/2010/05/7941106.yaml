    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a user clicks a hyperlink in an application like Mail or iChat, the link is opened in the default browser and focus immediately shifts to said browser.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click a hyperlink in any application that is not a browser.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe hyperlink should open in a new tab in the default browser without said browser stealing focus.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe hyperlink opens in a new tab in the default browser, stealing focus and forcing the user to stop what they are doing at least long enough to switch back to the application they were previously using.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOptimally, this would be implemented as a global user preference that would allow users to choose whether they wanted links to open in the foreground or the background, as implemented on a per-app basis in NetNewsWire, Tweetie, and several other applications."
