    description: "Use the German locale to reproduce:\r\n\r\nWhen selecting \"Search with Spotlight\" out of the context menu of a contact in the AIM list, a Spotlight query is opened in the Finder with a search term that looks like this:\r\n\r\n<AIM-ID> ODER <email address> [ODER <another email address] ODER <real name>\r\n\r\nThis query is wrong and gets no results. The \"ODER\" have to be replaced by \"OR\". Clearly, the \"OR\" must not be localized!"
