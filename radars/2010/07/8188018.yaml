    description: "Summary:\r\nIn google.com/maps and Maps.app, when I ask for a public transportation route, the time/route listing shows a circular icon for each MTA train. Over the past week, I have noticed that it leaves icons out, which gives an incorrect impression of how many transfers and how direct the route is. Trip #1 route in 0002 includes the Q train, but it's not shown in the list.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the map view, train icons at the location to board the train are missing. In 0001, I am supposed to board the Q on Flatbush, but there's no Q icon there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlot a mass transit route in NYC, typically one that uses the Q train.\r\nTap the clock icon to see a list of possible routes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaps.app should show me an icon for each train on the route.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome train line icons are missing."
