    description: "The popular RegExKitLite open source project apparently exposes a bug in clang 1.5 causing it to apply the C++ personality to the source file, even though C++ is not specified on that command line, and even though the source file in question does not contain C++ code.\r\n\r\nThe attached sample project exercises the problem, just open and build to observe that RegExKitLite.m is compiled using an objective-C flavor command-line invocation of clang, but that the resulting .o file ends up referencing stdc++ symbols.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for anybody who is using Clang LLVM to compile RegExKitLite. I don't know of any workaround short of linking with stdc++, which is a pretty undesirable concession to make in an otherwise C++ free project.\r\n\r\nThe current top-of-trunk clang builds from the open source svn repository do not exhibit this bug.\r\n\r\nSee also my blog post on the subject:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1345/regexkit-clang"
