    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease provide support for UIGestureRecognizers in InterfaceBuilder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to attach a gestureRecognizer to a view in InterfaceBuilder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- GestureRecognizers should be visible in the InterfaceBuilder Library under the objects tap.\r\n- It should be possible to attach one or more gestureRecognizers to a view in IB. Either by dragging them onto the view, like when nesting views, or using some kind of outlet.\r\n- The gestureRecognizer should show it primary attributes in the Inspector (like touches required, taps required, swipe direction, etc.)\r\n- The action of the gestureRecognizer should be connectable to a action on a viewController or other object in the nib.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGestureRecognizers are just shown as class, you can instantiate them with a nib, but you can not connect them to views or action, neither configure them in any way.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is likely to be a duplicate."
