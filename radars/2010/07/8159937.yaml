    description: "iPod.app shows the currently playing track's name, artist and cover art on the lock screen during playback. We've gotten numerous requests for this feature in our music app as well. Can we get an API for that?\r\n\r\nIf written as a general \"exposing current metadata\" API, it could be used for AVRCP 1.3 features as well (see http://openradar.me/8159944 )."
