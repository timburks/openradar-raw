    description: "Summary:\r\nSystem encountered a kernel panic after waking up display from sleep. The foreground process was WindowServer and it was stuck while rendering a builtin screensaver (RSS Visualizer).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCurrently uknown, but it seems like an OpenGL-related problem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisplay should wake up and operations should continue as normal\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWindowServer got stuck and caused a subsequent kernel panic\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSimilar behavior (WindowServer stuck, but no kernel panic) was observed in 10.6.3. 10.6.2 is not affected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSimilar errors have been happening for quite some time after upgrading to 10.6.3: WindowServer got stuck in a random call inside ATIRadeonX2000GLDriver.bundle, but it was still possible to ssh in and perform a clean shutdown of the system.\r\nMultiple Apple Hardware Test cycles didn't detect any hardware problem."
