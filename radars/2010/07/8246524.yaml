    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to add a new iPhone app via the new iTunes Connect UI released within the last few days, the system returns an error: \"\"You have no eligible Bundle IDs. Register one here.\" (The word \"here\" is linked to the iPhone Provisioning portal).\r\n\r\nAll of the app IDs associated with our iTunes Connect account use wildcard bundle IDs (ie. they end with \"com.laviaz.*\"). We have not had any problem creating apps prior to last night. None of these apps require the use of the iAds or In-App Purchase APIs. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. From an iTunes Connect account that has existing apps that were provisioned using only wildcard app IDs, login to iTunes Connect.\r\n2. Click \"Manage Your Applications\".\r\n3. Click \"Add New Application\".\r\n4. The system displays the error alert \"\"You have no eligible Bundle IDs. Register one here.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApps provisioned using only wildcard app IDs/bundle IDs should be able to be created when the \"Add New Application\" button is clicked, provided that they do not use APIs that require an app-specific bundle ID. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApps provisioned using only wildcard app IDs/bundle IDs cannot be created at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis problem did not occur prior to the update to the iTunes Connect UI that was released earlier this week.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe basic question here is: \"Are wildcard app IDs still supported, or not?\" \r\n\r\nIf not, we need to know that, and all references to wildcard app IDs need to be removed from the relevant documentation, including the iTunes Connect Developer Guide and the Provisioning Portal help pages.\r\n\r\nIf they are still supported, this is a critical bug that must be fixed ASAP."
