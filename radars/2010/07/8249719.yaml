    description: "Quartz Composer has no way of having global variables or preference parameters, short of patching every instance of their need back to root. Not only is this extremely tedious, it breaks on the slightest re-jig of the patch.\r\n\r\nA common example in my use are common font sizes, colour palettes, grid dimensions.\r\n\r\nYou could implement as a 'send receive' pair where the object sent is a constant, set in the settings panel. You could implement a true 'send receive' pair, but evaluation of the graph would get interesting.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a patch that can be duplicated throughout a comp, that has output ports with values that are shared across all instances of the patch in that comp.\r\n\r\nPlease also see http://www.openradar.me/8248416"
