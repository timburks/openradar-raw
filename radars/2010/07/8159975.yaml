    description: "If Airplane Mode is activated, or Data Roaming turned off while user is abroad, it is safe to make the assumption that no internet connection will become available for quite a while. During startup of our app, we always try to restore state from last run. Some of this state may require an Internet connection, in which case we show a loading window with the progress, and an option to cancel. I'd like to be able to detect Airplane Mode and Data Roaming Off, and in those cases, immediately cancel the parts of the state restore that requires an internet connection.\r\n\r\nMy current solution is to cancel restore if there is neither wifi nor wwan. This is a rather bad solution though, as a lack of wwan is in most cases temporary as the user is moving around."
