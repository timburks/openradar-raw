    description: "I have a custom subclass of IKImageBrowserCell for displaying additional information. I have ImageKit.framework in my Xcode project, since I prefer to minimize imports. As such, I have the following:\r\n\r\n\t#import <ImageKit/IKImageBrowserCell.h>\r\n\r\nThis successfully imports the header, but causes the following build error:\r\n\r\n/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ImageKit.framework/Headers/IKImageBrowserCell.h:43: error: expected ')' before 'IKImageBrowserView'\r\n\r\nThe problem is that IKImageBrowserCell.h refers to IKImageBrowserView, but neither imports the header nor uses a forward class declaration. Headers should always declare or import all required symbols.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to include a forward class declaration in my code before the import:\r\n\r\n\t@class IKImageBrowserView;\r\n\t#import <ImageKit/IKImageBrowserCell.h>\r\n\r\nThe @class declaration should instead be in IKImageBrowserCell.h, so developers don't have to figure out dependencies. (If developers have already worked around it with their own @class declaration and/or #import of ImageKit/IKImageBrowserView.h, it just works.)"
