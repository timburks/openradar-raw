    description: "0. Obtain an iPhone 4\r\n1. Load a podcast onto it\r\n2. Play the podcast\r\n3. Observe in the middle of the screen below the timeline is the \"rewind by 30s\" button\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nThe \"30\" in the arrow looks great.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe \"30\" in the arrow looks ugly. Very ugly.\r\n\r\nThe \"3\" looks like some twisted variant of Chicago (though it's not quite, and the \"0\" clearly isn't. Plus, the \"30\" isn't centered vertically.\r\n\r\nPlease redo it with the interface font, so that it blends in with everything else."
