    description: "29-Jul-2010 10:11 AM Chris Adamson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nTV episodes ripped from a DVD and numbered via iTunes are not shown in the correct order by the iPad \"Videos\" app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Rip episodes of a TV show from one or more DVDs.  Do not use TV shows purchased from iTunes, as these appear to have an item number that is distinct from the \"episode number\" that the user can edit with iTunes. \r\n\r\n2. Using iTunes, tag the episodes with show name, episode name, artwork, media type (\"TV Show\") and whatever other metadata is appropriate.  Importantly, use the \"episode number\" field under the \"Video\" tab to correctly number the episodes.  In the zip of screenshots I'm attaching to this bug, see \"episode-1-tag.png\".\r\n\r\n3. In iTunes, drag some or all of these episodes to attached devices that can play them, such as iPhones, iPods, and iPads.\r\n\r\n4. On the iPad, launch the \"Videos\" app and click the \"TV Shows\" tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe episodes should maintain their episode order as assigned in iTunes.  In the attached screenshot folder, I have three screenshots showing the episodes in iTunes: in the library, on an iPhone, and on an iPad (episodes-itunes-library.png, episodes-itunes-iphone.png, and episodes-itunes-ipad.png).  All of these maintain the correct order.  In my example, the correct order is:\r\n   Fateful Confession\r\n   The Girl From The Mystic Moon\r\n   The Gallant Swordsman\r\n   The Diabolical Adonis\r\n   Seal of the Brothers\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOn the iPad itself, the episode order is ignored and the episode order is unclear (in this example, they seem to be sorted alphabetically, ignoring \"The\" at the beginning of three episode titles).  The order shown on the iPad is as follows (with actual episode number in parentheses):\r\n   The Diabolical Adonis (4)\r\n   Fateful Confession (1)\r\n   The Gallant Swordsman (3)\r\n   The Girl From The Mystic Moon (2)\r\n   Seal of the Brothers (5)\r\n\r\nSee episodes-ipad.png for a screenshot of this ordering.\r\n\r\nAn iPhone running iOS 4.0.1 shows the episodes in the correct order.  See episodes-iphone.png.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe iPad shows the correct order for TV shows purchased from the iTunes Store.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe order in which items are dragged to the iPad seems to have no effect on the ordering."
