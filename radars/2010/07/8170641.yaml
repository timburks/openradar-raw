    description: "08-Jul-2010 10:30 AM Tom Andersen:\r\nSummary:\r\nOur app can deal with say Pages files as an example and needs to both hand off files to other applications as well as receive files from other applications.\r\n\r\nSo we edit the plist CFBundleDocumentTypes to say that we can deal with Pages files. ('Default') mode.\r\n\r\nWhen the user wants to send a .pages file onto another application (Likely the Pages app) then we call UIDocumentInteractionController.\r\n\r\nThe UIDocumentInteractionController (too) faithfully lists all applications that can deal with .pages files, and WE are on the list. I think that's confusing to the user, why would I use the UIDocumentInteractionController to hand a file off to US? How do we rid ourselves from the list?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWrite app, edit plist to say that the app can open any document type, then create a UIDocumentInteractionController. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat our app would NOT show up on the list of applications to hand the file off to. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe list of apps includes all applications on the phone/ipad that can open the file, which includes US. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3167590/uidocumentinteractioncontroller-our-own-app-shows-up-in-list"
