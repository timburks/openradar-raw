    description: "Summary:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nMobileSMS.app should support a preference to enable a SMS 'delivery reports' request, and then provide visual feedback to indicate whether or not a sent SMS has yet been reported as successfully delivered yet. I believe this is supported in the SMS protocol as a SMS-DELIVER-REPORT.\r\n\r\nIt seems iOS 4 may already requesting these under the covers, as messages that are eventually reported as 'failed to send' display as an exclamation mark on the icon (see attached screenshot), although this may actually be only used for errors pre-delivery (e.g., no signal, no credit etc.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nShould be possible to visually check if the recipient has yet confirmed receipt of SMS or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nNo support for delivery reports in iOS 4.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n------\r\n\r\nn/a"
