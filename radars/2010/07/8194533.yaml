    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a multi-SIM on a single contract with an iPad and an iPhone, incoming calls are dropped immediately. This is due to the iPad answering (i.e., canceling) all incoming calls.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- You need multiple SIM cards for one contract\r\n- Insert one in an iPhone, one in an iPad\r\n- Call the phone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe phone rings and the user can answer the call.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe phone rings at most once and the mailbox answers.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nRemove the secondary sim-card from the iPad and everything works again.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nOne very easy solution would be to have the iPad not cancel the call but have it ring \"forever\" -- e.g. until the net provider activates the mailbox.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is probably caused by the fact that the iPad identifies itself as a telephone to the SIM-card / telephone provider. If the second sim card is a full SIM (i.e. usable in a telephone as well), the iPad seems to answer and cancel the call immediately."
