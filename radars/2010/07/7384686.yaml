    description: "11-Nov-2009 10:00 AM Greg Harris:\r\nSummary: DVDHasMedia() fails with Unspecified Error on certain machines\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch the Apple sample app CocoaDVDPlayer\r\nInsert a video DVD\r\nMonitor the Console for output\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Once the DVD mounts, the app should open the disc and prepare for playback\r\n\r\nActual Results: Once the DVD mounts, the app stops on an assert while trying to call DVDHasMedia() with the error -70001 (defined as Unspecified error\")\r\n\r\nRegression: Using different DVDs doesn't seem to make a difference. The Apple DVD Player app works properly. Of the 5 machines in the attached SystemProfiles.zip, 3 exhibit the problem.\r\nThe affected machines are:\r\nRDS\t\t\t2009 15\" MBP - Leopard\r\nDolezal\t\t2009 15\" MBP - Snow Leopard\r\nMacPro\t\t2009 8-core Mac Pro - Snow Leopard\r\n\r\nThe following machines work properly:\r\nGBH\t\t\t2008 17\" MBP - Leopard\r\nNewMacMini\t2009 Mac Mini (dual display output) - Leopard\r\n\r\nNotes: The attached CocoaDVDPlayer.zip is the Apple sample app, unmodified except for build settings to get it to compile under Snow Leopard.\r\nThe attached SystemProfiles.zip file contains the System Profiles of the 5 machines mentioned.\r\nI'm filing this bug at the request of DTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n'CocoaDVDPlayer.zip' and 'SystemProfiles.zip' were successfully uploaded"
