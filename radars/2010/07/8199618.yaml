    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iPad is locked (either just auto-locked or also passcode locked), play/pause media key on Apple Bluetooth keyboard is enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair a Bluetooth keyboard with an iPad.\r\n2. Set a Passcode, with Immediate lock.\r\n3. Lock the iPhone.\r\n4. Press the Play/Pause key on the keyboard.\r\n5. Press and hold a number key.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing, or perhaps iPad wakes up and prompts for a password.\r\n\r\nThere should also be some safety feature to prevent pressure on the Return key from using up 10 unlock attempts and crypto-shredding the iPad.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMusic playback begins, with the iPad still locked. This is a good way to kill the battery accidentally.\r\n\r\nAfter 40 digits (would be slightly different with a complicated password), the iPad crypto-shreds all data. I didn't go past 8 digits/2 failures, but a friend experienced it.\r\nhttp://securosis.com/blog/incite-7-14-2010-mello-yello"
