    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Application Loader.app is now required to submit binaries to the App Store. In the process of uploading there are checks and validations run on the uploaded app bundle. If some part of the upload fails verification then error messages are displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nIf the error messages are too long then no amount of resizing the window or the column the message is in will allow the user to read the entire message (see attached images).\r\n\r\nThe Xcode validate build error dialog has no such problems (see attached images). Please fix the Application Loader.app to correctly display the entire error message to the user since this is now the only way to upload app bundles to the App Store. It would also be helpful if the error text could be copied so that the person uploading can pass on the errors to the dev team involved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUpload an app bundle with incorrect settings that won't pass validation via the Application Loader.app utility.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAll error messages are fully readable and can be copied to a text document or email.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nError messages over a certain length are not fully visible regardless of window resizing or column resizing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee attached images."
