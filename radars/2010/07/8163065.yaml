    description: "UPDATE 7/6/10: Duplicate of 8162995 (invisible).\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPlease provide an application:handleOpenURLWithOptions: or equivalent method that provides the same URL-related context that is passed to application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:\r\n\r\napplication:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: includes the source of a URL event, which is useful information that makes interesting IPC possible. It was also a single guaranteed point of entry on 3.x, because apps were always quit and relaunched. Therefore this delegate method was always called on third party apps when handling URLs from external sources.\r\n\r\nThe presence of multitasking in 4.x means that these apps may still be running, and there are now two possible points of entry for URL handling:\r\n\r\n1) application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:\r\n2) application:handleOpenURL:\r\n\r\nIf application:handleOpenURL: is sent to a suspended app on 4.0, the source application is unknown. This is a loss in functionality from 3.x and may even cause binary compatibility issues for a pair of apps that were using UIApplicationLaunchOptionsSourceApplicationKey to go back and forth. Please provide this information in all present and future API involving URLs.\r\n\r\nThe current situation also creates a problem of \"double-handling:\" if the app cares about launch info, then it will implement application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:, but it now also must implement application:handleOpenURL:. The app now gets two callbacks for a single URL unless it does something that doesn't quite feel right (falsely return NO from the launch method, maintain a fragile ivar or timer, etc).  A new handleOpenURLWithOptions: API would negate the need to do URL handling in application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n8A293 / 10M2262. Non-issue prior to 4.x.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease do this for 4.1 so we don't lose too much time in this conundrum. Third parties will quickly concoct bizarre algorithms for this, resulting in much larger binary compatibility problems down the road. It would also be appropriate for this problem to be solved in the very first 4.x iPad release."
