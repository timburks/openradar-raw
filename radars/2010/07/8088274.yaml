    description: "13-Jun-2010 10:59 PM Mark Dalrymple:\r\nI guess it's a cool feature that you can control-drag from a UIButton and\r\nget multiple methods triggered on a button press.\r\n\r\nI have not found a use for this.  And I have frequently been bitten by it.\r\nAs I'm prototyping a UI, I make a button, configure it, set a target, and\r\nrun.  Then I want another button, so I duplicate the previous button\r\nand set its target.  Now it has two targets.  And then when I start\r\nwriting (and debugging!) the action, I now am really confused because\r\nthis other method is firing before the method I expect to fire.  I scratch\r\nmy head, realize that I now have two actions on the button, curse, go\r\nto IB / Editor pane, delete the superfluous connection, and get on with\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome to be able to turn that behavior off until needed.\r\n(and I'd love to know what the use-case is for that behavior)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21-Jul-2010 10:32 PM Mark Dalrymple:\r\nand it's bitten me again."
