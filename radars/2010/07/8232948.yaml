    description: "Summary:\r\nBecause of their flexibility it's very common to use UIWebViews to display different types of content that are not web pages. However, it's not possible to (properly) hide the shadows above and below the view, or set the indicatorStyle of the scroll bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDisplay a UIWebView using some custom content generated within the app. Customize the view to help it blend in:\r\nwebView.opaque = NO;\r\nwebView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen customized a UIWebView should blend in with other views and not stand out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn many cases the shadows above and below are unexpected as they would not appear if the view was created from scratch. With a dark background, white scroll bars would be appropriate, but they'll be black.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is possible to make these adjustments by going through the subviews of a UIWebView, but needless to say this is not a great idea."
