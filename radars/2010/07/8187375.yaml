    description: "Summary:\r\nNSArray does not have an -initWithObject: method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to compile the following line of Objective-C:\r\nNSArray * myArray = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObject:@\"foo\"];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe code should compile without warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles but produces a warning that \"No -initWithObject: method found\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nProblem since at least Mac OS X 10.0 DP\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis seems like a silly oversight.  We have +arrayWithObjects: for when we need a temporary array of many objects, and -initWithObjects: when we need a more permanent array (perhaps as an ivar?) of many objects.  Since we also have an +arrayWithObject: method, it would be logical to assume that there is also an -initWithObject: method.  Sadly this is not the case."
