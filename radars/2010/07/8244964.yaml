    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working on a long trace it is necessary to zoom on the timeline to get the detail required. At high magnification scrolling the timeline is unusable because one scroller pixel corresponds to far more than a screen-width of data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSample for a couple of minutes (time profiler for example)\r\nZoom in on detail to about 70% of the control width\r\nScroll left and right\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScrolling works like Final Cut or Aperture: jog controls, scaled region control, and/or mouse scroll wheel movements, and/or trackpad gestures\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSimple whole-view scrolling with no fine control.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nShark had this exactly right, even though it omitted many possible controls for browsing the data.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
