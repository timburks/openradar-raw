    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nVideos chosen from the UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary source of UIImagePickerController have their audio tracks' balance set to around 90% left.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Download and run the included sample project on an iPhone 4 running iOS 4.0 or 4.0.1.\r\n2) Record a video using the \"Record from Camera\" button.\r\n3) Choose a video using the \"Choose from Library\" button.\r\n4) Connect the device to iTunes. In the Apps tab, copy the videos to your computer and play them. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBoth videos should have either Mono audio tracks as the originals do, or a balanced stereo track.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe video chosen from the device's library has its audio track playing almost entirely from the left channel. The video recorded directly into the app has correct audio.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown prior to iOS 4.x. Problem is present on iOS 4.0 and 4.0.1. \r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nSample project at http://www.kennettnet.co.uk/files/VideoTest.zip"
