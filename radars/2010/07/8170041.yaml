    description: "I vote for bug number ‘8170041′\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI, as an iPhone developer, would love to see Apple lead the way in allowing international developers to hand out promotion codes to anyone for our apps. Currently, developers can ONLY give promo codes to US iTunes account holders. And while this is a great feature, it is of little or no value to international developers such as myself in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBottom line ~\r\nWe want to promote our apps within our own country and generate more sales.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAt present, all developers must follow the steps for ad-hoc distribution in order to ‘give away’ our apps for free for promotional purposes such as reviews. This can be hard for a non-technical user to understand, and takes much more time and effort than a simple promo code handout.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect better from Apple! It would be great to expand the current functionality provided by iTunes Connect, to allow the developer to select the destination (country) app store which the developers reviewer, or the receiver, is from, and then choose the amount of codes as currently is the case.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs outlined\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\nNotes:"
