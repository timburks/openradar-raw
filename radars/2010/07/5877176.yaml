    description: "21-Apr-2008 02:32 PM Adrian Ward:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\nQuartz Composer lacks any menu options to aid the user in tidying up or laying out their patch. Much like Adobe Illustrator's Alignment functions, a few basic menu options should be provided to allow multiple selected patches to be aligned/spaced evenly, either vertically or horizontally. A snap to grid feature might also be useful.\r\n\r\nOther improvements could be the allow connections between patches to be 'pinned' via intermediate coordinates. Where an output needs to loop back to an input, the current technique of drawing a bezier curve between the input and output produces patches that are unreadable (the connection goes *behind* the patch in question) and difficult to use/alter. The problem also arises in complex patches where lots of bundles of connections need to be routed long distances across patches. Using two intermediate Input Splitters is the only way to relieve the situation but this destroys the conceptual structure of a QC patch - that a box equates to a 'function' (in a high-level context).\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nSee the attached PDF for an example view of a complex patch that would greatly benefit from pinnable connections and alignment functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n'ComplexPatchGetsMessy.pdf' was successfully uploaded"
