    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting UIRequiresPersistentWiFi in your plist makes the app show a warning about Airplane Mode being on every time the app becomes active. Our app has an Offline Mode, in which case it doesn't need wifi, and the Airplane mode dialog is annoying. I'd suggest only showing the dialog once per Airplane Mode session, or give us an API to say \"I don't need network right now\".\r\n\r\nSee rdar://problem/7183872 or http://openradar.me/7183872 for a sample. Good quote that I agree 100% with:\r\n\"I understand why iPhone OS want to do this. UIRequiresPersistentWiFi is a hint to the OS that the app needs wifi. Problem is, app needs that setting because it doesn't want to see wifi disconnected when the app is active. Whether the app wants to remind the user *it needs wifi* is another matter--and here OS makes the decision for the app.\r\n\r\nThis can be annoying because user already knows they're in airplane mode, and usually also know the full consequence of being in that mode. OS 3.0 now already reminds user once. To repeat that reminder every time when the app becomes active again is annoying. For example, if the user wakes up the phone simply because they want to adjust some settings, then switch off screen again, then the reminder blocks in the middle of the quick adjustment, and can be confusing.\""
