    description: "23-Jul-2010 10:57 AM Chris Donnelly:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWe received an e-mail from Apple yesterday regarding our use of UIGetScreenImage() in our apps:\r\n\r\n>With the availability of the AV Foundation framework in iOS 4, public API >equivalents are now available. Applications using UIGetScreenImage() to capture >images from the camera should instead use the AV Foundation AVCaptureSession and >related classes. Note that use of AVCaptureSession is only supported in iOS4 and >above, so make sure your min OS is appropriately set. More details on how to capture >video frames from the camera as images using AV Foundation can be found in Technical >Q&A 1702: \r\n>http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/qa/qa2010/qa1702.html\r\n\r\n>For applications using UIGetScreenImage() to capture the contents of interface views >and layers, the -renderInContext: method of CALayer in the QuartzCore framework  >should used instead. For more information, see Technical Q&A 1703, \"Screen capture >in UIKit applications\": ><http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/qa/qa2010/qa1703.html>\r\n\r\n>If these APIs do not provide the functionality you want, we recommending filing an >enhancement request using the Apple Bug Reporter at <http://bugreport.apple.com> to >let us know what you need.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we anticipated this and made the latest versions of our apps (which are Ready for Sale in the App Store) *do* use AVFoundation/CoreVideo in iOS 4.0 and only use UIGetScreenImage() as a fallback in iOS 3.1.  Unfortunately, we need to continue to support our 3GS customers using iOS 3.1, as it will probably be a few more months before all have upgraded.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn approved API (private or public) that supports grabbing of video content in iOS 3.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nQA1702 only works in 4.0; QA1703 works in 3.1, but does not support video content.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince it is camera related, iOS 3.2 is not relevant here, as 3.2 only exists on the iPad, the iPad does not have a camera, and any future version that does will (hopefully!) be running iOS 4.1 or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n2010-08-02: The upshot is they basically said \"we'll let you know\" and let the ticket auto-close.  So UIGetScreenImage() is dead."
