    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen an text configuration file (.xcconfig) is used for a project's build settings, \r\nand the .xcconfig sets the SDKROOT property to an iPhone device SDK,\r\nand the Xcode project settings don't override the setting (i.e. it doesn't appear bold-faced in the UI),\r\nthen the menu Project -> Set Active SDK menu becomes disabled,\r\nand one can only build for the simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an new Xcode project targeting iPhone.\r\n2. Create an .xcconfig file and add it to the project.\r\n3. Go to the project settings and set the Based On choice to the .xcconfig file\r\n4. Add a line to the file: SDKROOT = iphoneos4.0\r\n5. In the project settings, delete the \"Base SDK\" setting, so that the value from .xcconfig is used.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOne can switch between building for device or simulator by changing Project -> Set Active SDK.\r\nThe Active Executable setting includes simulator or device versions based on the choice for Set Active SDK.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe menu Project -> Set Active SDK is greyed out, reading \"Base SDK\".\r\nThe only Active Executable options are for the simulator.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis also occurs with the SDK for iPhone OS 3.2.  I don't have any earlier versions of the SDK to test.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf you remove the SDKROOT setting from the xcconfig file, then the project thinks it targets \"Current Mac OS\".\r\nOne has to re-set the base SDK to \"iPhone Device 4.0\"."
