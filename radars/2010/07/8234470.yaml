    description: "Core Text does not draw emoji characters when rendered with CTFrameDraw() or CTLineDraw(). Instead it renders them with the \"missing glyph\" symbol. UIKit's string drawing methods will render the emoji characters as expected, but at a loss of a lot of the fine grained layout metrics available when using Core Text.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if Core Text supported emoji, but the real motivation behind this is a need to draw/query attributed strings that support emoji. Just drawing such a string is half the battle, though. What's missing with UIKit's string drawing methods are (fast) ways to query for things like the bounding boxes of arbitrary ranges of the string so that stuff can be drawn behind or around or nearby certain lines or characters of text within a larger block of text or some parts of the text can be used for hit testing (such as for a link). Right now that stuff is basically impossible with the existing UIKit string methods which forces one to go down to the Core Text level in order to get the information required to do those things - except then emoji support is lost and must be worked around in clever and complicated ways.\r\n\r\nIf something like this is added to UIKit, it makes sense to me to make this be a separate class and not just additional category methods on NSString and/or NSAttributedString. That way a UITypesetText (or something) object can be created for a given rectangle which caches the layout information of an attributed string making querying it's properties or redrawing it fast and efficient."
