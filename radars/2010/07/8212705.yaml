    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApple's marketing describes push email as a feature of Snow Leopard Server at http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/features/mail-services.html\r\n\r\nHowever the push email seems to not be compatible with the iPhone client.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Turn on Mail Service in Server Preferences on your Snow Leopard Server, foo.example.com.\r\n\r\n2. Create a user account on your Snow Leopard Server, bar.\r\n\r\n3. Optional: On a Snow Leopard client machine, add the mail account bar@foo.example.com to Mail.app and send a test email to verify that push email to the client is functioning.\r\n\r\n4. On an iPhone running iOS 4.0.1, add the mail account bar@foo.example.com to the Mail, Contacts, Calendars pane in the Settings app.\r\n\r\n5. Send a test email to the bar@foo.example.com account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the iPhone's Settings app, Mail, Contacts, Calendars pane, under the \"Fetch New Data\" method -> Advanced, the setting for the bar@foo.example.com account should list Fetch and Manual and Push as supported methods.\r\n\r\nIf Push is selected, then incoming email should be received immediately, even when iPhone's MobileMail is not running.  Popup notification should be received.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the iPhone's Settings app, Mail, Contacts, Calendars pane, under the \"Fetch New Data\" method -> Advanced, the setting for the bar@foo.example.com account lists Fetch and Manual, but not Push, as supported methods.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone does not receive the email by any push method.  It will not be received until the MobileMail app is running and its scheduled fetch occurs.  No popup notification is received.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPush email was added to iPhone OS MobileMail in version 2.0.  Push email was added to Mac OS X client Mail.app in version 10.6 Snow Leopard, and to Mac OS X server in version 10.6 Snow Leopard Server.  MobileMail and Mail.app are compatible with both Microsoft Exchange's ActiveSync protocol and with MobileMe's XMPP-PubSub for receiving push.  Snow Leopard Server should have feature parity with MobileMe and Exchange.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/12/iphone-and-snow-leopard-servers-failure-to-communicate.ars\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Server#Mac_OS_X_Server_10.6_.28Snow_Leopard_Server.29"
