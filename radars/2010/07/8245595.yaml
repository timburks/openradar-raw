    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Safari Extension Builder does not support symbolic links and aliases in the following two ways:\r\n1) If Info.plist is a symbolic link or alias, and a change is made to the extension's settings in Extension Builder, then Extension Builder will overwrite the symbolic link or alias with a regular file.\r\n2) If any other extension files (global.html, a .js file, etc.) is a symbolic link or alias, then it will be excluded from the built extension package.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) In Directory A, create extension.js and Info.plist.\r\n2) In Directory B, create symbolic links to the files in Directory A.\r\n3) Open Extension Builder and add an extension, using Directory B.\r\n4) Make a change to the extension settings in Extension Builder.  Note that Info.plist in Directory B is now a regular file and now a symlink.\r\n5) Click Build Package to build the extension.\r\n6) Extract the contents of the built extension using \"xar -xf extension-name\".  Note that extension.js is not in the package.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExtension Builder should seamlessly work with symbolic links and aliases.  It should treat them as if they were regular files, and it should not overwrite them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs described in the summary, Extension Builder overwrites Info.plist if it is a symbolic link or alias, and ignores any other symbolic links or aliases when building an extension.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue did not occur in Safari 5.0.  It is new to 5.0.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor various organizational reasons, it can be desirable to point Extension Builder to symbolically linked files.  This bug makes that impossible."
