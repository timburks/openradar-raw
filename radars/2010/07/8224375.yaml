    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPlease book Jonathan Coulton to headline the concert at the next WWDC Thursday Night Bash\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Get familiar with the music of Jonathan Coulton http://www.jonathancoulton.com/\r\n2. Pay special attention to geeky songs like \"Code Monkey\", \"Re: Your Brains\", \"Mandlebrodt Set\", \"Podsafe Christmas Song\", \"Flickr\", etc.\r\n3. Attend WWDC 2011\r\n4. Go to the Thursday Night Beer Bash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nJonathan Coulton should perform there\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSome other lame band like U2 instead, who knows?\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWouldn't you like to go back in time and instead ask Jonathan Coulton to be the performer at the WWDC bash? You don't need to!  Start the process now and you will make a lot of geeky WWDC attendees very happy.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nJonathan Coulton would be perfect for the WWDC bash.  Please book him! \r\n\r\n BTW I filed this classification as \"Performance.\"  Get it?  :-)"
