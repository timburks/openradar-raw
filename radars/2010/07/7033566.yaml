    description: "06-Jul-2009 01:00 PM Greg Harris:\r\nSummary: \r\nThe ADC Documentation for OS X's DVD Playback Framework needs updating. There are new functions (new in 10.5) which are not documented in the \"DVD Playback Framework Reference\" such as DVDDoMenuCGClick(), DVDDoMenuCGMouseOver(), and DVDSetVideoWindowRef() just to name a few. These functions are noted in the documentation as replacements for older deprecated functions, but are not mentioned anywhere else in the documentation, they can only be found in the DVDPlayback.h header file.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the related \"DVD Playback Services Programming Guide\" uses deprecated functions in it's code samples.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDVD Playback Framework Reference: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/DVDPlaybackRef/Reference/reference.html\r\n\r\nDVD Playback Services Programming Guide: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/DVDPlaybackGuide/dvdguide_intro/dvdguide_intro.html\r\n\r\nCocoaDVDPlayer sample project: http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/CocoaDVDPlayer/index.html"
