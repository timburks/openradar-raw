    description: "MPMusicPlayerController has no error reporting or handling facilities, even though errors are fairly common. \r\n\r\nFor example, [MPMusicPlayerController iPodMusicPlayer] always returns a value. However, it IPC's with something (presumably iPod.app); if iPod.app does not exist (Simulator) or no music has been synced, communication cannot be set up. This is an error case, yet a value was returned from the constructor. Making any call on this object locks up the calling thread until the call times out. There is no way to programmatically detect this, as the error is only printed to console and not returned through the API. This would constantly lock up our UI until we moved all MPMusicPlayerController communication to its own dedicated thread.\r\n\r\nYou get the same behavior if iPod.app crashes or for some other reason stops responding after having created the proxy object. (Yes, even iPod.app can crash, especially in low memory conditions)\r\n\r\nI recommend that the API is redesigned as an asynchronous API (as that's what it is internally, with the IPC) with callbacks and errbacks. If that's not an option, at least return nil from the constructors (applicationMusicPlayer, iPodMusicPlayer) on failure, and add a callback for if the IPC connection dies. Some NSErrors would be nice, too."
