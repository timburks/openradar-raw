    description: The AVCaptureSession and AVCaptureDevice APIs allow you to control the torch (LED) when a session is running. This allows you to use the torch as a flashlight, however it also means that the camera is also activated whenever the torch is turned on.  It would be much more efficient to provide an API that provides control over the torch without activating the camera. This would greatly improve battery efficiency.
