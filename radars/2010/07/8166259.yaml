    description: "7-Jul-2010 04:59 PM Dominik Wagner:\r\nSummary:\r\nbefore fast app switching, the ensured entry point when launched with URLs, pushNotifications, etc. was\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\r\n\r\nnow with fast app switching that is not the case anymore. Developers need to make their own determination on how to identify URLs or Push notifications on activation. This is messy and broken and has to rely on either some weird timer or some sort of logic which is not guaranteed. E.g. in Carcassonne we do this:\r\n\r\nif we\r\n - did receive applicationDidEnterBackground: and\r\n - did receive applicationWillEnterForeground: and\r\n - did not yet receive applicationDidBecomeActive:\r\n we treat push notifications and URLs as being tapped from outside the app.\r\n\r\nThis is not good.\r\n\r\nProposed fix:\r\n- add pplicationWillEnterForegroundWithOptions: which would contain the same options as the applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions: so we have all the data we need to take the appropriate action without shooting ourselfs if things change."
