    description: "Since the last update, screenshots can't be edited on the fly but only when submitting an update.\r\n\r\nWhile we appreciate the fact that screenshots of new features can be tight to an update, it's a very bad situation to change that behavior without any further notice.\r\n\r\nSo far, our workflow always was to submit the binary and description, then work on optimal screenshots while waiting for the review. We did the same way for our latest update we submitted right before the iTC change. Now we're locked and can't change the totally wrong screenshots.\r\n\r\nEssentially we're forced to submit a bogus update just to change the screenshots. This can't be in neither Apple nor the developers interest."
