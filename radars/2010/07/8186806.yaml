Build and run MyImagePicker on a device with a few hundreds photos in Camera Roll\r\n2. Navigate to Camera Roll album\r\n3. Start scrolling down\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth scrolling like in UIImagePickerController\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBad scrolling performance.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSuperficial analysis with Instruments showed possible reason: -[ALAsset thumbnail]. Please refer to full trace attached to this radar.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIs there any chance to recreate basic UIImagePickerController functionality using AssetsLibrary.framework with the same performance level?"
