    description: "If I implement the Remote Control API (-[remoteControlReceivedWithEvent:] and friends), I get remote control events from dock connector accessories, headsets, lock screen and task switcher. However, from Bluetooth devices implementing AVRCP, I only get play/pause toggle, and none of the other events (prev, next, fast forward, reverse). *That*, I consider a bug.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I would like to request support for *all* of the AVRCP functionality up to version 1.4. More detailed information is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_profile#Audio.2FVideo_Remote_Control_Profile_.28AVRCP.29 , but in summary, AVRCP 1.3 adds communication from the host app to the device with relevant information such as:\r\n- The status of the music source (playing, stopped, etc.)\r\n- Metadata information on the track itself (artist, track name, etc.).\r\n\r\nAVRCP 1.4 adds browsing playlists, search, and more."
