    description: "Summary:\r\nALAssetRepresentation produces weird CGImageRefs that return weird CGDataProviderRef. Any attempt to generate CGImageSourceRef from it and access to image at index 0 generates an error because there is no images in this CGImageSourceRef. Thus I'm not able to copy image's metadata to alter it and dump via CGImageDestinationFinalize.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSample should not crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMethod -[CGDataProviderBugViewController proceedWithGroups] triggers NSAssert at line 82 (count of images in CGImageSourceRef equals to zero).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bug exists in both 4.0 and 4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug can be workarounded in following way: Convert CGImageRef of ALAssetRepresentation into UIImage, then UIImage to NSData and finally use this NSData as input for CGDataProviderRef. But this way is much heavier in terms of performance."
