    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSafari 5's URL bar autocomplete is over aggressive, frequently completing an unwanted or stale URL\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIt will be different on everyone's machine, but in my case:\r\n\r\n\"start typing Google.com\"  or \"macrumors.com\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSafari completes \"google.com\" or \"macrumors.com\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSafari replaces my typing with \"reader.google.com\"  or \"forums.macrumors.com/plus/url/to/discussion/I/haven't/looked/at/in/weeks\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSafari 4 wouldn't complete me to a different subdomain than what I was typing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhen asking on twitter if there was a way to quiet this, got a number of \"I don't know, but please please tell me when you figure it out.  XYZ is driving me crazy\""
