    description: "Summary:\r\nUnlike Shark (RIP), Instruments does not allow filtering of the graph display by thread. This means that even though I can filer samples by thread, I can't see where they lie or quickly figure out what is causing the activity I see.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSample a multithreaded app using Time Profiler. \r\nCheck Separate By Thread\r\nSelect individual threads in the drop-down\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGraph is modified accordingly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo change to graph.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nShark was able to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo thread switch lines either!"
