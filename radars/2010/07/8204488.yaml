    description: "Summary:\r\nThe simulator cannot provide all of the features that the physical device can and this makes testing difficult. For example, multitouch with two fingers is severely limited, and any more is impossible. As another example: motion and orientation information is not available.\r\n\r\nAllow an attached device to provide the missing data for the simulator. This should be a selectable mode in the Organizer."
