    description: "iTunes seems to delete the metadata of all pictures when synchronizing with an iPhone or iPad, even in the latest version.\r\n\r\nIf you have an ALAsset asset and use that code:\r\n\r\n        ALAssetRepresentation *representation = [asset defaultRepresentation];\r\n\tNSLog(@\"Location: %@\", [asset valueForProperty:ALAssetPropertyLocation]);\r\n\tNSLog(@\"Date: %@\", [asset valueForProperty:ALAssetPropertyDate]);\r\n\tself.metadata = [representation metadata];\r\n\t\r\nYou get a dictionary without EXIF or IPTC data if the image comes from iTunes sync.\r\nIf the image comes from the iPhone camera, you have all exif.\r\n\r\nIf you read the bytes of the image and try to find the exif dictionary, you will find zilch: it's been deleted.\r\n\r\nThis makes the synchronizing feature useless for professional photographers or expert photographers as all info has disappeared.\r\n\r\nNever leave a picture without its metadata..."
