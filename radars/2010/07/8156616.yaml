    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you create a popover that contains a table view  (with a text field in one of the cells), then open that popover somewhere near the bottom of the screen, and tap the text field to bring up the keyboard, the popover will move up (as it should, to avoid being covered by the keyboard). However, as this happens, the scrolling bounds of the table view completely screw up. Immediately after the keyboard has opened, the contents of the table view move up way past the bounds and are no longer visible unless you manually scroll it back down. In addition to this, normally when you scroll down, it should bounce back up when it reaches the bounds, but here, it will keep scrolling down way past the scrolling bounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Note: when trying to reproduce this bug, use landscape orientation. The bug is present in both portrait and landscape orientations, but it is more visible in landscape because the keyboard covers a larger area of the screen)\r\n\r\n1. Create a UITableViewController with 1 or more cells, and in one of the cells, add a text field as a subview of the cell\r\n2. Use the -contentSizeForViewInPopover method to return an appropriate size for the view when in the popover (I used {320.0, 200.0} for my example)\r\n3. Create a new UIPopoverController object using the UITableViewController as the content view controller\r\n4. Present the popover in an area somewhere near the bottom of the screen\r\n5. Tap inside the text field to bring up the keyboard\r\n6. Watch the scroll bounds of the table view inside the popover completely screw up\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen the keyboard is brought up, the scroll bounds of the table view should stay intact as the popover moves up to avoid being covered by the keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhen the keyboard is brought up, the popover moves up to avoid being covered by the keyboard, but the scroll bounds of the table view in the popover get messed up.\r\n\r\nRegression: None\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSample project which clearly demonstrates this bug:\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/d1ce48ec93b7d24ffaae"
