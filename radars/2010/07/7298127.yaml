    description: "Currently there is no provision for developers to offer a volume licensing scheme for 'off the shelf' applications, which may be installed internally in large organisations on anywhere from 100 to 1000+ phones.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is no way to offer volume tier discounts for an app, or even provision multiple phones with an app downloaded from the store.\r\n\r\nThe SDK agreement specifically prohibits any billing mechanism for paying for apps outside of the app store, so the app can not be offered free, and the licensing billing / verification handled outside of the app store.\r\n\r\nAlso this sort of app doesn't suit the enterprise developer program, as the app is not specific to any one particular company.\r\n\r\nI don't even know how this sort of system would ever work on the app store. But it covers a surprising large class of business apps."
