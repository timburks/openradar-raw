    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI'd like a \"total duration\" property for an MPMediaItemCollection / MPMediaPlaylist\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\nI'm creating a workout utility for folks to create custom workouts.  I want to the user to choose a playlist from which random songs will be taken.  I want to display the total duration of the playlist so they'll know if the playlist is long enough for their ride time.  A 20 minute playlist isn't helpful if the workout is going to be two hours long.\r\n\r\nSo now I need to fetch the playlist, fetch the items, enumerate them and sum the times, for every playlist, even though the user will only pick one playlist.  This involves moving each media item's information from the music library to my app.  If the playlist times can be calculated for me by the music player, that'll greatly reduce the amount of work I have to do and the amount of data that has to be schlepped over.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
