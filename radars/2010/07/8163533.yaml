    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere is no sane way to sell off the shelf iOS apps to businesses in volume.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build an awesome 'off-the-shelf' iPad app perfect for large multi-user deployments in varying size businesses (http://www.polarbearfarm.com/airforms/).\r\n2. Panic when you realise there is no sane way to actually sell and distribute it within businesses.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Businesses should be able to purchase an application from the App Store in volume, and distribute it amongst devices in their control.\r\n2. An added bonus would be the ability to set volume license pricing tiers.\r\n3. A double bonus would be the ability to offer upgrade pricing (i'm sure there's approx. 1 billion radars for this already, e.g. radar://7298125).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. None. It doesn't appear to be possible. Currently these are all the possible scenarios as I see them:\r\n\r\n• We can't distribute using the enterprise program as that starts at 500 users, and the overhead is far too high in managing each customer with custom builds, device provisioning etc.\r\n\r\n• We can't distribute a free app and rely on companion server software licensing components, as it's a totally self contained product.\r\n\r\n• We can't distribute a free app, and implement our own device activation and volume licensing system, as that violates our agreements with Apple.\r\n\r\n• So really the only *possible* option as I see it would be for organisations to require users personally pay for a license and they'd be reimbursed by the company. However that means the software is linked to that users iTunes account, and therefore not owned by the company. i.e. a totally insane solution.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
