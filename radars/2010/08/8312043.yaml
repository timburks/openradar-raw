    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe NSViewFrameDidChangeNotification exists on the desktop, but not in the iOS SDK (where it would presumably be called UIViewFrameDidChangeNotification).  There are several cases where it would be useful to have this.  (See Notes: for an example)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(none)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe notification would be posted when a UIView's frame changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo notification is posted when a UIView's frame changes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis notification has been absent since iOS 1.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFor an example of how this could be awesomely useful, consider this project: http://github.com/davedelong/CHLayoutManager\r\n\r\nIt's a singleton that does for NSViews what CALayoutManager does for CALayers.  Having this capability on the iPhone would be awesome, because then you could do more advanced layout manipulation during device rotation, etc that are currently tedious to do via rotation callbacks, etc."
