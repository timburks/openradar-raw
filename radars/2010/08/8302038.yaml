    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDatePickerView leaks memory through NSDateComponents objects when datePickerMode is set to UIDatePickerModeDateAndTime only. More leaks occur as user scrolls through a UIDatePickerView in this mode.\r\n\r\nAs reported by Leaks performance tool: responsible library for leaks is UIKit, responsible frame is  UIDatePickerView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Download Apple's sample source code UICatalog here: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/UICatalog/index.html\r\n2) Run and build UICatalog on device.\r\n3) Quit app, Run with performance tool Leaks\r\n4) Go to Pickers\r\n5) Check for Leaks Now in Instruments (no leak yet with custom picker)\r\n6) Tap on 'UIDatePicker' segmented button at bottom, check for leaks (no leak yet at UIDatePickerModeDate)\r\n7) Tap on '3' at the top segmented control to change datePickerMode to UIDatePickerModeDateAndTime, check for leaks.\r\n8) Two leaked NSDateComponents object reported\r\n9) Scroll through the first component of the datePicker, check for leaks\r\n10) More leaks detected via NSDateComponents objects\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo leaks should occur when UIDatePicker is set to UIDatePickerModeDate, nor when user is scrolling through such a picker.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLeaks occur as soon as UIDatePicker is set to UIDatePickerModeDate. More leaks occur as user scrolls through the picker.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nLeaks occur on both simulator and iPhone device. Happens only when UIDatePicker is in UIDatePickerModeDate mode. Tested on 4.0.2 build. Also leaking in 4.1 beta 3 before update was applied.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNil"
