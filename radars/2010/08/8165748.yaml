    description: "07-Jul-2010 12:43 PM Dirk Theisen:\r\nSummary: We deploy a darwin calendar server in our office which is available under the same DNS name from outside and inside the office, but with different IP-Numbers (internal, external IP). Whenever we move our macbooks from e.g. home to office without restarting iCal, ical complains about not being able to access / update from our CalDAV server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo problems accessing CalDAV servers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\niCal can no longer get or set events from our CalDAV-server.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nRelaunching iCal fixes the problem reproducibly.\r\nThe external IP / port forwarding is not accessible from inside the office this might cause the failure.\r\nA fix might be to somehow clear DNS caches used in iCal after a network change / awake from sleep."
