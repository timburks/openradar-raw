    description: There are cases where a developer might want to provide subtle button clicks (similar to the keyboard clicks) or other interface sounds in an application. Currently the only way to let users turn these sounds on and off is to create a setting in each application. That's not a terrible solution, but it's not ideal. In some cases it's fair to assume that if the user has disabled certain sounds—like the keyboard clicks—they would not want to hear other similar sounds in a third-party app. Being able to automatically disable those sounds based on the "Keyboard Clicks" setting could provide a better user experience. This would also allow these similar sounds to be turned back on in one place, instead of various places throughout each app.
