    description: "Summary: When a UIPopover is shown via presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem: or UIActionSheet  is shown via showFromBarButtonItem:, and the item is a UIBarButtonItem in a UIToolbar that was set as the inputAccessoryView of a UILabel text field, the popover is shown rotated to the wrong orientation. After rotating the device to a new orientation, the popover still has the wrong orientation relative to the rest of the UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In an Xcode iPad project, add a UILabel editable text field in IB.\r\n2. Also in IB, add a UIToolbar with a UIBarButtonItem.\r\n3. In code, set the text field's inputAccessoryView to the toolbar.\r\n4. Send the becomeFirstResponder message to the text field.\r\n5. Present an action sheet from the toolbar button item using [actionSheet showFromBarButtonItem:sender animated:YES];\r\n\r\nExpected results: Popover or action sheet should have the same orientation as the rest of the UI.\r\n\r\nActual results: Popover or action sheet is rotated sideways when the device is in landscape, and upside-down when the device is upside-down.\r\n\r\nRegression: The same popover or action sheet presented from a toolbar item in a regular view does not have this problem. It only seems to affect toolbars that have been set as the input accessory view and shown above the keyboard.\r\n\r\nNotes: There's a bug that if you set a UILabel's label.inputAccessoryView, but then set label.editable = NO in the view controller's viewDidLoad, the accessory view is still visible even though the keyboard is not shown.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshots."
