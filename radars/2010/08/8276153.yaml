    description: "04-Aug-2010 07:13 PM Rick Terrill:\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently, UIWebView ignores the \"autoplay\" property of an HTML5 <video> element.  It also will not play programmatically prior to user input that requests playback.  This prevents a user from unwittingly using more bandwidth than they had wanted to on mobile devices.\r\n\r\nWhen embedding a UIWebView into an iPad (or iPhone) application, I often ship videos in the application that are loaded into a <video> tag which I would like to play automatically or programmatically.  An example is a looping video background in a design.\r\n\r\nThis request for an enhancement is for <video> to differentiate File system URLs from Network URLs. If the URL is from the file system, then autoplay and programmatic control should work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an XCode Project with a UIWebView, an HTML file with a <video autoplay src=\"movie.mov\"></video> tag, and a valid movie (movie.mov).\r\n\r\n2. Program the UIWebView to load the local HTML file which is built into the app.\r\n\r\n3. Notice that autoplay is ignored.\r\n\r\n4. Try calling .play() on the <video> element with Javascript.\r\n\r\n5. Notice that doesn't work unless it is in response to a tap from the user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the video file is loaded from the file system, autoplay and programmatic control should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video doesn't autoplay wether via Javascript or the \"autoplay\" option is specific on the <video> tag.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nnone (other than that it works on desktop Safari)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI currently get around this by including an invisible button and calling a click on that programmatically.  It looks like even that is disabled in 4.x. I understand the reason for trying to lock this down in all ways (to conserve bandwidth and performance), but there should be a way to distinguish between local and network videos."
