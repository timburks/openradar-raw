    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSchools and other organisations managing large numbers of iOS devices need a way to identify the owner of a device in the absence of the ability to unlock the device and inspect Settings > General > About.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nNone. Feature doesnt' exist.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis feature does not exist on iOS 3.2.x for iPad nor iOS 4.x for iPhone and iPod touch.  I'm particularly interested in iPad, but others might want it for handhelds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have deployed 115 iPads in my school. They are all passcoded with a unique password for each user. We have labelled the Apple iPad case, but it's unclear that the labelling will survive the use and abuse of schoolchildren.\r\n\r\nWe need a way to pick up a device and reliably determine the owner of the device without necessarily having the ability to unlock it. Of course, we know the students' passwords but it's time consuming to go and find the password list in a locked filing cabinet just to find out whose device you're holding.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful indeed to be able to set the device to show the device name on the lock screen. Additionally, it would be helpful if this setting could be forced via a configuration profile.\r\n\r\nOne workaround might be to create a lock screen image with the name or photo of the owner on it. Unfortunately, this is both extremely time consuming to generate and not very reliable. School children, in particular, love to customise their devices and it is not currently possible to force the lock screen to a specific image."
