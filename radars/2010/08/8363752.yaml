    description: "27-Aug-2010 05:11 PM Jakub Argasi≈Ñski:\r\nSummary: Sometimes (I was unable to find any regular pattern, but temporary high system stress might be related) applications \"hang\" in an unusual way -- they seem to not respond to keyboard typing. It is not limited to any particular application -- it happens in Eclipse (Helios, Cocoa), Text Edit, Firefox, etc. Simply typing keyboard doesn't make the text show (the window surely is focused!), but it appears when I click on the text input area/window (some, very very slight delay between characters being output on the screen is visible). If this condition happen, it is reproducible (ie. typing a portion of text starts to be visible only if I click in the input).\r\n\r\nAnother interesting, similar symptom is context menu not being shown after right clicking an element (ex. file in a Project Explorer view), but visible after a left click following this right click.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: No easy way to reproduce. When happens, stroke some keys and left click to see them being output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: There should be no hangs etc. and no delay / stuck of key presses. \r\n\r\nActual Results: Application seems to be unresponsive / hang. No high CPU usage, no \"unresponsive\" when Cmd+Option+Esc. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: What's interesting, sometimes it is possible to \"unstuck\" the application, but I'm uncertain what steps needs to be taken in general. In Eclipse, rapid left-clicking between two open views (ex. Project Explorer and editor view) helps in most cases.\r\n\r\nThis problem is not limited to my machine only; I have observed this problem on my girlfriend's white MacBook (Snow Leopard, 10.6.4)."
