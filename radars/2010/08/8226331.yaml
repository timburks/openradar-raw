    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf AVAudioPlayer is used to play a sound (with AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient) in an app that is started (not from suspended start) after iPod is already playing, iPod will stop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start iPod and play a song\r\n2. Run an app that will play a sound with AVAudioPlayer (and AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\niPod continues playing.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\niPod stops playing.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWorks properly in this order:\r\n\r\n1. App starts\r\n2. App suspended\r\n3. Start iPod and plays a song\r\n4. Resume app and play sound (and iPod will continue as expected)\r\n\r\nBecause iOS < 4.0 doesn't support fast task switching, this always breaks < 4.0 and breaks when app is not starting from suspended state."
