    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf a Yahoo email account is setup, it constantly polls for new email instead of honoring the Data Fetch \r\nPush or Fetch settings. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add Yahoo mail account in Settings.app\r\n\r\n2. Set Push to \"Off\" in Mail Settings\r\n\r\n3. Set Fetch of \"Manually\" in Mail Settings\r\n\r\n4. Check email in Mail to get things started\r\n\r\n5. Exit mail. \r\n\r\n6. Send email to Yahoo account. \r\n\r\n7. Watch as mail badge is updated with new unread count\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYahoo mail account wouldn't continue to check email. All other accounts (all Gmail based accounts) honor the mail fetching preferences. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYahoo mail continues to check email all day long, thus sucking the life out of my battery. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression in iOS 4.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI believe I also had to go into the \"Advanced\" settings in Mail Fetching to turn all the other accounts to manual to get them to stop checking all the time. Almost like the \"Fetch\" setting is also being ignored."
