    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen viewing a contact's Info in Contacts.app, bringing the phone to your ear should call the contact. \r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nA few times while I was distracted, I've brought up a contact in Contacts.app, and then raised the phone to my ear. Somehow, I had expected Contacts to dial the number for me.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nA few seconds later I would realize that I hadn't tapped a phone number to dial, so nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would probably be an optional feature turned on in Settings, but it seems like such a natural gesture. So natural that I tried to do it several times unconsciously! I would think the logic could go like this:\r\n\r\nIf a contact has no voice (non-fax, non-pager) phone numbers, do nothing.\r\nIf a contact has only one voice number, dial it\r\nIf a contact has multiple voice numbers, first look for a number labeled \"main\" to call.\r\nElse look for an \"iPhone\" number to call.\r\nElse look for a \"Mobile\" number to call.\r\nElse if it's business hours (9am-5pm, or localized per country), look for a \"work\" number to call.\r\nElse if it's after hours (5pm-9am, or localized) look for a \"home\" number.\r\nElse do nothing.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that anyone who has marked a number \"main\" will want that to be the default number dialed. Otherwise, they'll probably want to call another cell phone, with home/work as a last resort, and with no action if the numbers have custom labels or no labels (they could be fax numbers after all)."
