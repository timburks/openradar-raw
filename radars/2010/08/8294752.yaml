    description: "10-Aug-2010 05:28 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen developing iOS code on a device that requires a passcode, Xcode cannot begin debugging until the passcode has been entered. Xcode should be able to enter the passcode and unlock the device so that debugging can begin.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAttach an iOS device that requires a passcode and verify that it is locked. Attempt to debug an iOS app on the device. The device presents its passcode screen, but Xcode fails with messages reading:\r\n\r\nError launching remote program: device locked.\r\nError launching remote program: device locked.\r\nThe program being debugged is not being run.\r\nThe program being debugged is not being run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode would prompt the developer for the device passcode and enter it over the USB connection.\r\n\r\nXcode would store the passcode in the Mac's keychain for future use.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAs above.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has never been a feature, though it may have failed differently in older versions of Xcode."
