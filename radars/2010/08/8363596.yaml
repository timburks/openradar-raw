    description: "Summary: iTunes is using up to 70% (according to iStat Menus 3.0.5) or up to 50% (according to Activity Monitor) CPU and makes 1200-1400 reads per second (Activity Monitor again) when being in Album view and on the top of the list (i.e. showing 1st or 2nd row of the album covers). It does not happen in any other mode (sort by Performer / Genre / Composer -- I could do some mistranslation here, I report from Polish version of Mac OS X). What's interesting, the problem disappears when I scroll down the album list to the 3rd row.\r\n\r\nI can attache \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Launch iTunes, switch to Album view if necessary\r\n\r\nExpected Results: CPU and disk usage should be minimal or none.\r\n\r\nActual Results: CPU usage is constant and oscillates around 70%, disk usage is high (about 10-12 MB read, almost no write)\r\n\r\nRegression: It seems to be a regression bug of some kind, i.e. I don't remember such behavior in iTunes 9.1.\r\n\r\nNotes: Mac OS X 10.6.4 (10F569), MacBookPro6,2 (2.53Ghz)"
