    description: "Summary:\r\nA Gmail account can be added as an IMAP or Exchange account in iOS. When the same account is added as both an IMAP and Exchange account on the iPhone, and the IMAP account disabled but not removed, all mail sent outside of the Mail.app (eg. Safari, 3rd party apps) gets stuck in the Outbox.\r\n\r\nSee complaints and workarounds: \r\n1) http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%20Mobile/thread?tid=2e897d448ea639af&hl=en\r\n2) http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2469497&start=75&tstart=0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add a Gmail account (with IMAP enabled within Gmail) via Settings.app > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account\r\n2) Turn off both Mail and Notes syncing from the newly added account. Gmail IMAP account should show 'Inactive' in Mail, Contacts, Calendars\r\n3) Next, add the same Gmail account as an Exchange account to enable push and calendar syncing following Google's instructions: http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&topic=14252\r\n4) Turn on Mail syncing with this newly added exchange account.\r\n5) Set the 'Default Account' under Mail, Contacts, Calendars to the newly added exchange account\r\n6) Launch Safari, navigate to www.apple.com (or any website)\r\n7) Tap the '+' button from the toolbar below, and select 'Mail Link to this Page' from the action sheet\r\n8) Enter an email address and send the mail out\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail should be sent out with a sound alert (if volume is not muted).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail is not sent out. Launch Mail.app and the mail is stuck in the Outbox. Tapping refresh does not send the mails out. Tapping the unsent mails in the outbox individually and manually tapping Send sends them out.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nEmails do not get stuck when mail is sent directly from Mail.app. Problem only affects mails sent from outside Mail.app (such as Safari and other third party apps)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProblem disappears when the Inactive IMAP account is removed entirely from Mail, Contacts, Calendars within Settings.app rather than left as Inactive."
