    description: "01-Sep-2008 12:21 PM Dirk Theisen:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nIn CFSocketStream you cannot change SSL settings after the connection was established.\r\nThis is according to the Docs. It however prevents use of CFStream to implement WELL KNOWN protocols like SMTP with STARTTLS, which demand turning on SSL after initial unencrypted negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt can be done with raw sockets and the SSL library.\r\n\r\nDirk"
