    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nThe weather app included with the iPhone fails to find cities starting with a Turkish letter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch the weather app\r\n2. Tap the \"i\" button on the bottom right corner\r\n3. Tap the \"add\" button on the top left corner\r\n4. Type \"İstanbul\" (or İzmir, Şırnak, Şanlıurfa, etc.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nİstanbul should be among the search results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo results are found.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf İstanbul was added previously, the weather app fails to load new weather information and displays the message \"Update failed.\"\r\n\r\nReplacing the İ in İstanbul with an I, a common workaround for similar issues, does not change the results.\r\n\r\nThe online service at weather.yahoo.com doesn't seem to work for these cities either.\r\n\r\nThis issue also affects the weather dashboard widget included with Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nIstanbul (with a dotless capital I) seems to work on weather.yahoo.com, but not İstanbul."
