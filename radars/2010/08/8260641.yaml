    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way for one iPhone Developer to transfer ownership of an application to another iPhone Developer on the App Store unless they are buying the entire company. This isn't always the case. For instance, I have acquired two applications from one developer who also sells Mac applications. So I only purchased the App Store apps. \r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is for customers who had purchased the other developer's version of the products. Since there is no transfer process for individual apps, I had to put up new binaries with the same name and he had to remove his from sale. This means customers have to re-purchase my version to continue to receive updates. This causes a large amount of confusion and negative reaction from customers. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Acquire an app from another developer\r\n\r\n2. PAIN\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Acquire an app from another developer\r\n\r\n2. Painlessly transferred to the iPhone Developer account of my company\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPAIN"
