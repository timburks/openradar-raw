    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like a way to reuse non-UI Interface Builder custom plugins between my Mac code and my iPhone/iPad code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have an app, written a while ago, that used an IB 2.0 palette to set up its initial data model objects. I am now in the process of rewriting that as an IB 3.0+ plugin, but I'm also in the process of porting this data model to a new application + UI for iPad. I would like to be able to reuse that IB plugin work from the Mac app on the iPhone/iPad side.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a new feature.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
