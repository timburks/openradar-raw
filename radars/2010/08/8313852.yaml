    description: "16-Aug-2010 06:40 PM Oliver Drobnik KG:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf you load a navigation controller from MainWindow.xib, but add the first view controller in appDidFinishLaunching, then there is a problem on rotation. A gray empty status bar appears underneath the regular status bar which cannot be eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a Navigation based project.\r\nSet status bar to be initially hidden.\r\nSet navigation controller to want full screen and have nav bar hidden\r\nImplement a tap method in the view controller to hide and show the status bar\r\nMove the view controller outside of the navigation controller in the IB\r\nAdd a line to app delegate to push the now separate view controller onto the navigation controller.\r\nStart the app, rotate once sideways with shown status bar\r\ntap to hide the status bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo extra gray status bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA sticky gray status bar appears underneath the disappearing regular status bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a project to demonstrate the behavior. Plus a screenshot.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is inconsistent with creating a navigation controller in code. There no extra status bar appears."
