    description: "04-Aug-2010 03:30 PM William Denniss:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMy gps-enabled application ('GPS Log') allows users to log places they visit.  No internet connection is required at all, as the iPhone hardware can get GPS positions without a connection.  This is a common operating condition when users are away from their home country.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Airplane mode is enabled, the GPS hardware will not function.\r\n\r\nApple's response to this last year was to put the 'UIRequiresPersistentWiFi' key in the plist, and set to TRUE.  This will pop up a message like \"Turn off Airplane mode or use Wi-fi to access data\" when Airplane mode is enabled.\r\n\r\nWhile better than nothing, this dialog is a little misleading, as the user doesn't need to \"Access data\", nor does Wifi solve the issue.\r\n\r\nI would really like a simple way to check if Airplane mode is enabled, to be able to display a custom (more appropriate) message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe reachability sample does NOT solve this, as an internet connection is not needed at all – only Airplane mode needs to be disabled for the GPS hardware to function."
