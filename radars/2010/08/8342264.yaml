    description: "23-Aug-2010 11:37 AM Branton Homer:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen creating an FSEventStream with FSEventStreamCreateRelativeToDevice, passing the kFSEventStreamCreateFlagWatchRoot flag has no effect. Root changed events are never received.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a FSEventStream using FSEventStreamCreateRelativeToDevice monitoring a directory on your system.\r\n2. Delete (or move to the trash) the parent folder of the monitored directory.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn event with the kFSEventStreamEventFlagRootChanged flag set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such event is sent. As a result, if a user needs rootChanged events, they need to create a stream using FSEventStreamCreate. However, a stream created in that manner is not as useful when persisting event IDs, as mentioned in the documentation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a sample application which clearly demonstrates the issue. In main.m, there are two #define'd variables at the top of the file. One of them controls whether the stream is created with FSEventStreamCreate or FSEventStreamCreateRelativeToDevice. The other controls the path to watch.\r\n\r\nTo use the test app, create a folder with a subdirectory. Set the PATH_TO_WATCH constant to be the path to the subdirectory. Start the application, then move the parent directory to the trash. If the stream was created with FSEventStreamCreate, the stream callback will be invoked with a rootChanged flag set. If not, the callback is never invoked."
