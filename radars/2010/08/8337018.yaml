    description: "There are many cases where adding a custom keyboard shortcut for a Safari Extension would be useful, but there's no proper way to do this.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use an injected script to detect key presses. This will only work on HTML pages though (and not on images or PDFs, for example). It could also conflict with shortcuts set up on the current web site. While it is technically possible to allow the user to define a shortcut key in the extension's settings, the whole process is a bit clunky, and the unreliability (working only on HTML pages) is a major drawback.\r\n\r\nMac OS X allows users to define keyboard shortcuts in the System Preferences. There seems to be no way to make this work with extensions thoughâ€”it doesn't seem to work with contextual menu items.\r\n\r\nIn short I would like to see an official method for defining keyboard shortcuts that is:\r\n- user definable\r\n- works cross-platform\r\n- reliable (doesn't rely on injected scripts/works on all content types)"
