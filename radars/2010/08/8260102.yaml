    description: "Summary:\r\nOur IMAP mail server at work runs on port 143 only due to firewall restrictions in place by the hosting company, so it requires that users use TLS via the STARTTLS command. under iOS 3.2 and previous, I could get this behaviour by sliding \"Use SSL\" to on, then overtyping the port 993 with 143. Under iOS 4.0, this doesn't seem to be possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a server to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Under the Advanced section, slide \"Use SSL\" on. Attempting to save this configuration will time out if the server isn't listening on port 993. Going back into the Advanced section now shows the port as 143. Forcing a save, then checking the port reveals it's set to 993. Changing this to 143 and attempting another save goes through the sames steps. 143 shows in the tableview, but connections are attempted to 993.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSettings should be able to connect to the mail server and confirm my credentials.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am informed \"The IMAP server at {address} is not responding...\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked on iPhone OS 3.x, and works on my iPad running 3.2.0. I have not yet updated to 3.2.1."
