    description: "Summary: /usr/bin/Validation in the iOS 4 SDK is a little overzealous in its processing of Info.plist files. When validation is run as part of either the validate build product phase or as a result of using the Application Loader to upload to iTunes Connect, it errantly attempts to process either all Info.plists in the bundle or the first one it encounters as part of a directory traversal search of the bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave your project copy over directories that contain Info.plist files that are meant to describe the contents of the directory for internal application use (example, to describe positioning, scaling, spacing information about a deck of cards for the purposes of layout and additional overlay drawing done by the application)\r\n\r\nbuild a build configuration with the validate build product turned on\r\n\r\nwatch as it tells you that your Info.plist is missing its CFBundleResourceSpecification key: \"warning: Info.plist does not contain a CFBundleResourceSpecification (-19015)\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nbinary should validate since the root level Info.plist actually does have the key/value pair\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nwarning: Info.plist does not contain a CFBundleResourceSpecification (-19015) in Xcode, and fatal \"you can't upload your binary\" in Application Loader.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nperhaps it should actually be an error and not a warning since Application Loader treats it as a fatal error, additionally it should clearly only be using the root level Info.plist for its validation."
