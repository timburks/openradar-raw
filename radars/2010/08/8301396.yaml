    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn my recent trip to Denmark (I live in the UK), I turned my phone on in the plane after we landed, and immediately received 6 emails, even tho Data Roaming is off (it's always off, I never, EVER use data when roaming, too expensive).\r\n\r\nIf I try to do any other data after turning airplane mode off, it fails (as it should). Just appears to be the initial \"new country, new network....\" type thing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTurn on airplane mode.\r\nGet in a plane and fly to another country.\r\nTurn off airplane mode\r\nSee the emails which have come in despite data roaming being off. \r\nWonder how the hell this happened. Wonder if it'll happen again. Wonder how big the bill is going to be.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo email. No data traffic. No crazy telco charges!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nEmail! Data Traffic! Around £20 of data charges over 5 trips (between 3-10£/meg over 4 trips)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. This never happened with 3.x on my 3G. But on the 4/iOS4, happens on every trip.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is not a one-off case. Happened this week in Denmark (£3/meg), to my wife in Morocco (£6/meg) and Canada (£10/meg), and both of us in Amsterdam (£3/meg). I thought it was a billing error from O2, but it appears not. The amounts have never been much, so I just let it go, unti I actually got email, which was unexpected.\r\n\r\nThere was no WIFI anywhere around, and both phones are setup to not even ask if we want to connect to wifi, let alone do it automatically.\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, it's doing this:\r\n\r\nairplane mode turns off. cell radio turns on, finds a new, unknown network, but no network name yet / roaming status, so assumes it's ok to use it.\r\n\r\nmail sees network and opens a TCP connection \r\n\r\nthe OS sees that it's roaming and stops all NEW TCP connections, but the existing one stays open\r\n\r\nmail downloads messages, and closes TCP connection\r\n\r\nmail later fails to open a new one (which is good)"
