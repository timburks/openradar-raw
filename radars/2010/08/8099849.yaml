    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI've been doing some work with the audio components of JavaScript within a Safari 5 Extension yet I'm unable to load local audio files (e.g. bundled with the extension).  For instance:\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n\r\nvar audio = new Audio('http://homepage.mac.com/qt4web/testmusic.m4a');\r\naudio.play();\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work (but should):\r\n\r\nvar audio = new Audio(safari.extension.baseURI+'testmusic.m4a');\r\naudio.play();\r\n\r\nI am able to load JS, CSS, and image files from within my extension bundle but audio files don't seem to get included correctly. I submitted the issue to Safari Extensions Support (Follow up number: 109526720) and they asked me to report the issue here as a bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nnb. some test code has been attached to this bug report\r\n\r\n1) Create a Safari 5 extension with a basic button linked with a global HTML file which can send a message to a function inside an injected javascript file\r\n2) Create a javascript file that is injected at start\r\n3) Create relevant function (to link to the message sent by the button) that contains the following code:\r\n\r\nvar audio = new Audio(safari.extension.baseURI+'testmusic.m4a');\r\naudio.play();\r\n\r\n4) Ensure \"testmusic.m4a\" is within your application bundle.\r\n5) Run the extension and clicking the button will do nothing\r\n6) Add the following line of code to the Javascript file to output the path to the music file:\r\n\r\nalert(safari.extension.baseURI+'testmusic');\r\n\r\n7) Copy the path that is alerted (in my case this was: safari-extension://com.bendodson.testextension-NLC45LKD5Y/testmusic.m4a)\r\n8) Try to open the URL in Safari and you'll find Quicktime can't load the file (as it can't find it)\r\n9) Change the \"var audio\" line in your Javascript to the following:\r\n\r\nvar audio = new Audio('http://homepage.mac.com/qt4web/testmusic.m4a');\r\n\r\n10) Rerun the extension and pressing the button will now play a sound file (might take a couple of seconds for it to download.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAt step 5, a sound should be heard\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLocal sound files can't be found - Safari 5 doesn't appear to let Extensions access files from the bundle that aren't JavaScript, CSS, or images.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI tried a number of things to try to get the sound files to play.  I tried different filenames (as my original file had a hyphen in which could have been causing the problem) as well as different filetypes (e.g. MP3, WAV, and AAC) - these all streamed fine but wouldn't work from the application bundle.\r\n\r\nThe official Safari 5 Extension Documentation (at http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/InjectingScripts/InjectingScripts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009977-CH6-SW1)  states that:\r\n\r\n\"Your injected scripts can access resources—images, HTML, and other scripts, for example—within your extension folder\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that only images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can currently be injected as the generated paths to other resources don't work.\r\n\r\nI've only been able to try this on Mac OS X (10.6.3 and 10.6.4) so I don't know if this issue affects Safari 5 on Windows."
