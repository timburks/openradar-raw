    description: "Summary: In an Xcode project which was originally an iPhone OS template, with an iPad target added, and then finally a Mac OS X target added, building the Mac target no longer works in Xcode 3.2.4 (that comes with iOS SDK 4.1).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce via attached project:\r\nThen install Xcode 3.2.4 and iOS SDK 4.1. \r\nOpen the attached Xcode project, HelTweetica.xcodeproj.\r\nSwitch to the Dev target.\r\nVerify that the current settings are for Simulator - 3.2 | Debug | Dev | Dev | i386.\r\nBuild the project and verify that it succeeds.\r\nSwitch the Active Target to Mac.\r\nBuild the project. \r\nIf building suceeds, try switching back to the Dev target, select Simulator, build, and then switch back to the Mac target and build again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Xcode should switch the active SDK and architecture to be appropriate for Mac OS when building the project.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Xcode fails to build the project.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nA clean install of Xcode 3.2.3 and iOS SDK 4.0.1 has no problems with the project.\r\n\r\nA clean install of Xcode 3.2.4 without the previous version also has this problem.\r\n\r\nBuilding with Xcode 3.2.4 (from iOS SDK 4.1 beta) results in \"No architectures to compile for (ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES, active arch=x86_64, VALID_ARCHS=armv6 armv7).\" and an internal error."
