    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen calling UITableView's reloadSections:withRowAnimation: method, specifying a section containing a cell with an accessoryView that is first responder (a UITextField, for instance), the cell will either disappear, or not change at all, depending on whether animation is used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Display a cell with a UITextField\r\n2. Make the text field first responder\r\n3. Call reloadSections:animated:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNew section is displayed (keyboard hides, or stays put if new section contains a text field that was previously first responder - this is what iOS 3.x does)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf animation is used, the cell disappears\r\nIf not, the entire cell containing the first responder does not change at all, although the other cells in the section do change.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAppears to be a problem with 4.x only, not 3.x. Have only tested with 4.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee attached test app"
