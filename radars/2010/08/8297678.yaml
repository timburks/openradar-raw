    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an app that plays background audio, adding the appropriate key to the plist will cause the red status bar to show briefly if the app is send to the background with a single home click and the audio session includes recording. All three conditions are required for this to happen. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate app that uses a recording audio session and set the Plays Background Audio key in the plist\r\nRun the app and single-click Home\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpringboard appears\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpringboard appears with red status bar\r\nRed status bar disappears after about a second; just long enough to confuse the user\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBy the time willBecomeInactive is called, the decision to display to the red status bar has already been made (you can test this by breaking on it), so changing the audio session to a non-recording one is futile (I have tried). Sending the app into the background by other methods (double-click, app selected) does not have the problem, nor does making it inactive."
