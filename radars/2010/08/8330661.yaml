    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are certain UIGestureRecognizers that should provide a CGAffineTransform when they're recognized.\r\n\r\nThe effects of UIPanGestureRecognizer, UIPinchGestureRecognizer, and UIRotationGestureRecognizer can all be expressed as a CGAffineTransform, and this is how they're quite commonly used.  If the user wants to move a view around, we can attach a PanGestureRecognizer and use the \"translationInView:\" method to reposition the view (tap and drag, essentially).  However, the developer still has to break the CGPoint returned from translationInView: into its components and construct a CGAffineTransform manually.  The same goes for rotation and pinching (or scaling).\r\n\r\nIn addition, a CGAffineTransform can abstractly represent any kind of linear operation: translation, scaling, and rotation.  In other words, it exactly represents the manipulations that Panning, Pinching, and Rotating are designed to initiate.\r\n\r\nAs such, please consider adding methods to UIPanGestureRecognizer, UIPinchGestureRecognizer, and UIRotationGestureRecognizer that would provide this CGAffineTransform.  You can easily add as a superclass of these classes (\"UITransformationGestureRecognizer\") that defines the method, and that the subclasses all implement to return the appropriate transform."
