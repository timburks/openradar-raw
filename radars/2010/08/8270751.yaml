    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes, I (and I believe many others) have a need to load multiple OS versions in order to test that configuration. Could there some feature added for developers to register a particular iPhone UDID that is permitted to load any recent OS version (specifically 3.1.3)?\r\n\r\nThe current solution put forth by Apple in the forums is \"just use a device that you haven't upgraded\".  Personally I don't have such a device, and have difficulty obtaining one (not living in the US).  I don't think it's really a good solution to have to rely on \"whatever you happen to have lying around on your desk\" either. Being able to load all recent OS versions onto a device for testing purposes would be very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have a spare iPhone 3GS which I use exclusively for testing.  Unfortunately, I upgraded it to OS 4.0 and have lost the ability to load 3.1.3 on it to test support for that version.  This made it extremely difficult for me to test 3.1.3 support (which a sizable percentage of my users still use) prior to releasing a recent update.\r\n\r\nI understand Apple may have business reasons for disallowing such downgrades, but developers have a real need to do this (so they can test every OS version they support).  Perhaps by allowing developers to register a single device only, Apple could then allow installations of specific past OS versions that are useful for testing (currently, that would be 3.1.3)."
