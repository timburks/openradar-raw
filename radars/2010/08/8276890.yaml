    description: "Scenario:\r\n\r\n* Release v1.7 of App X.  This version is compatible with 3.x and ARMv6 devices.\r\n* Add new release, v2.0 of App X.  Note this is a major version number increment.\r\n  * I choose to mark 2.0 as an upgrade release.  This implies the last version (v1.7) will remain available for sale indefinitely or until I choose to remove it.\r\n  * This version is updated, perhaps Info.plist is marked as requiring OpenGL ES 2.0 and ARMv7 devices.\r\n\r\nUsers can continue to access v1.7 on their older hardware.  Users with newer hardware can move to v2.0, which exploits advances in the hardware.\r\n\r\nAllows us to clean up our code bases and remove lots of redundant code for v2.0\r\n\r\nBonus Points:\r\nSupport upgrade pricing for major version increments.  Given v2.0 is a major version increment, add option to specify upgrade price from Free to a value equal to or less than the current full sale price."
