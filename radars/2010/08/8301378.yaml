    description: "12-Aug-2010 11:04 AM Matt Gemmell:\r\nSummary: Developer Tools and iOS SDK versions should be available as patch-updaters, not just enormous full installations _every_ _single_ _time_.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Wait until any new version of Xcode or the iOS SDK is available. Notice how it's a massive multi-GB download, even though Xcode hasn't changed and the iOS SDK has altered in only minor ways. Notice rapidly increased heart-rate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Being able to apply a patch-updater to the developer tools and iOS SDK.\r\n\r\nActual Results: I collapse with frustration and rage, and vow undying vengeance against whatever bright spark decided that multi-GB downloads are reasonable to patch an SDK version.\r\n\r\nRegression: Myself, regressing to a childlike state due to rage.\r\n\r\nNotes: Seriously, what are you playing at? Get this fixed."
