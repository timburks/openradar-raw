    description: "15-Aug-2010 08:46 PM Rodger Combs:\r\nSafari Extension settings often need to be more customizable than the Safari 5 Extensions settings box can provide. For example:\r\n\r\n1. A control may only be applicable when another checkbox is checked, so fields should be able to be disabled\r\n2. Controls may need to be created/deleted at will of the application, based on other configuration, etc.\r\n3. A field besides those available may be needed (e.g. a table with one column and editable cells with buttons to create and delete rows)\r\n4. Controls may need subtitle or help text\r\n\r\nMy solutions:\r\n1+2: A settings management system similar to that of context menu items or extension bars.\r\n3: Adding the ability to define a .html file as a control type, alongside the current list of field types.\r\n4: A help-text/subtitle field for each control (simple enough)."
