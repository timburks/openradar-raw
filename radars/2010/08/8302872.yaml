    description: "*** SUMMARY\r\nThe Apple iPhone Provisioning Portal sometimes generates incorrect \r\nApp Store distribution profiles. These profiles, for apps with push\r\nnotifications enabled, lack the required aps-environment key/value \r\npair necessary for push notifications to work.\r\n\r\n*** STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Create an app with push notifications enabled.\r\n2. Generate a production provisioning profile through the provisioning\r\nportal.\r\n\r\n*** EXPECTED RESULTS\r\nThe App Store mobileprovision file should have a key/value pair inside\r\nthe Entitlements dictionary (viewable by opening the mobileprovision\r\nfile inside a text editor). This is per the documentation:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ProvisioningDevelopment/ProvisioningDevelopment.html\r\n\r\nThe documentation even says:\r\n\"\"\"Verify that the entitlements in the provisioning-profile file are correct. To do this, open the .mobileprovision file in a text editor. The contents of the file are structured in XML. In the Entitlements dictionary locate the aps-environment key. For a development provisioning profile, the string value of this key should be development; for a distribution provisioning profile, the string value should be production.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n*** ACTUAL RESULTS\r\nSometimes the mobileprovision file is generated without the correct \r\naps-environment key/value pair. Sometimes it is. I have attached two \r\nsuch files, one with the key/value pair present, and one without. The\r\nconfiguration of the app was not changed between the generation of these\r\ntwo files.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of this problem include an error like:\r\n\r\n\"no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application\"\r\n\r\n*** WORKAROUND\r\nKeep generating new files until the portal decides to generate a proper\r\nmobileprovision file.\r\n\r\n*** REGRESSION\r\nUnknown. Unlikely, as this process has been flaky for as long as I can\r\nremember.\r\n\r\n*** NOTES\r\nThis has wasted a huge number of developer hours. If you Google for the \r\nstring \"no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement\", you will find hundreds\r\nof blog posts, mailing list questions, etc trying to figure out what the\r\nproblem is.\r\n\r\nMany of the solutions eventually come down to \"re-do the entire process\",\r\nwhich is consistent with my findings above.\r\n\r\nIMO, this should be a P1."
