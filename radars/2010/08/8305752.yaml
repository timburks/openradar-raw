However Quick Look in the finder seems to preview the first page correctly. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download the attached file to the Finder.\r\n2. Double click to open the file in Preview.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTwo pages show up in the side page area, looking correct. Clicking on either page shows the page in full, non-squished size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe side pages show correctly, but the actual page in Preview shows up as squished. Almost as though the tif reading code has gotten the height and width confused.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has been happening at least since 10.6.3, during the time I have been receiving quotes for mortgages from this bank. It looks like some sort of fax software has created this tif files. \r\n\r\nNotes:"
