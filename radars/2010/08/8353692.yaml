    description: "Summary: Intermittently, opening a link from the Mailplane app should open Safari, but it shows this error instead. It seems that if Safari has not been opened since the last restart this happens, but trying again and clicking the link in Mailplane a second time will succeed in launching Safari. This bug is intermittent and I'm not sure how to reproduce it consistently. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: Restart the computer and make sure Safari is not running. Open the Mailplane app, open an email message with HTML and a link, and click on the link. \r\n\r\nExpected results: Safari should open and load the URL in the link.\r\n\r\nActual results: Safari fails to open and the OS shows the attached report.\r\n\r\nRegression: This did not happen with Safari 5.0 if I recall correctly. This also does not happen if Safari is already running when the link is clicked. Quitting Safari and then opening the link to launch Safari also does not cause this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess:         Safari [239]\r\nPath:            /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\r\nIdentifier:      com.apple.Safari\r\nVersion:         5.0.1 (6533.17.8)\r\nBuild Info:      WebBrowser-75331708~1\r\nCode Type:       X86-64 (Native)\r\nParent Process:  launchd [159]\r\n\r\nDate/Time:       2010-08-25 13:40:04.144 -0400\r\nOS Version:      Mac OS X 10.6.4 (10F569)\r\nReport Version:  6\r\n\r\nInterval Since Last Report:          59721 sec\r\nCrashes Since Last Report:           1\r\nPer-App Interval Since Last Report:  59254 sec\r\nPer-App Crashes Since Last Report:   1\r\nAnonymous UUID:                      2B5FA40B-23E1-4260-9542-F1AC033A4149\r\n\r\nException Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\r\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000\r\nCrashed Thread:  0\r\n\r\nDyld Error Message:\r\n  Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$_WebUserContentURLPattern\r\n  Referenced from: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\r\n  Expected in: /Applications/_Apps/Mailplane.app/Contents/Frameworks/WebKit/WebKit.framework/Versions/A/WebKit\r\n in /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\r\n\r\nModel: MacBook5,1, BootROM MB51.007D.B03, 2 processors, Intel Core 2 Duo, 2.4 GHz, 4 GB, SMC 1.40f2\r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 9400M, NVIDIA GeForce 9400M, PCI, 256 MB\r\nMemory Module: global_name\r\nAirPort: spairport_wireless_card_type_airport_extreme (0x14E4, 0x8D), Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.10.91.27)\r\nBluetooth: Version 2.3.7f1, 2 service, 12 devices, 1 incoming serial ports\r\nNetwork Service: AirPort, AirPort, en1\r\nSerial ATA Device: APPLE SSD TS256, 233.76 GB\r\nSerial ATA Device: HL-DT-ST DVDRW  GS21N\r\nUSB Device: Hub in Apple Pro Keyboard, 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.), 0x1003, 0x06200000\r\nUSB Device: PS/2+USB Mouse, 0x04f3  (ELAN Microelectronics Corportation), 0x0212, 0x06210000\r\nUSB Device: Apple Pro Keyboard, 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.), 0x020b, 0x06230000\r\nUSB Device: BRCM2046 Hub, 0x0a5c  (Broadcom Corp.), 0x4500, 0x06100000\r\nUSB Device: Bluetooth USB Host Controller, 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.), 0x8213, 0x06110000\r\nUSB Device: iPad, 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.), 0x129a, 0x24100000\r\nUSB Device: Built-in iSight, 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.), 0x8507, 0x24400000\r\nUSB Device: Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad, 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.), 0x0236, 0x04600000\r\nUSB Device: IR Receiver, 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.), 0x8242, 0x04500000"
