    description: "21-Aug-2010 10:21 AM Alan Francis:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI just purchased a new iPad and on plugging it in for the first time, it received a software update to 3.2.2.  \r\n\r\nOn activating Xcode I was informed I couldn't use the device for development as Xcode couldn't find a software image for 3.2.2 and I should downgrade the device or update Xcode.  At this stage I'd have thought the diffs between versions of the SDK would be small enough that software Update could handle a patch of some sort, but I was, once again, required to download 2.5Gb of software, most of which is identical to what I already have.  \r\n\r\nBy sad coincidence, my office network is being upgraded and is currently running at <1Mb so I'm going to be waiting some time for this DMG to download.\r\n\r\nI'm also unable to use the Xcode4 beta at all as it seems it hasn't been updated with the new OS revisions.\r\n\r\nSurely if Xcode (3 or 4) can build for OS3.2/4.0 the resulting binaries will run happily on 3.2.2 and 4.0.2 ?  I might not be able to submit to the app store, but IMO I *should* be able to develop and deploy to my device."
