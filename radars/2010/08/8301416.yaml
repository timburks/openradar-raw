    description: "12-Aug-2010 11:35 AM Stephen Darlington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn Settings.app->General->Network I have 3G enabled, Cellular Data ON and Data Roaming OFF. This is on an iPhone 4. I have a contract with O2 in the UK.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Switzerland I received a voicemail. My handset downloaded this (VisualVoicemail) and, presumably, while that data connection was open it also downloaded my email. This resulted in an unexpected charge from O2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nReceive a visual voice mail when roaming.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo data charges when Data Roaming is disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA larger phone bill than expected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNot sure what the correct behaviour is here. Should VVM be disabled? Should Mail not be so enthusiastic?"
