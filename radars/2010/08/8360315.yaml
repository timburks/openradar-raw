    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice to be able to view multiple replies I've sent to the same email. Currently Mail.app only shows one reply.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send a reply to an email from Mail.app.\r\n2. Hit the reply indicator on the left-hand column of the inbox where the original email resides.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like a window with multiple tabs for each reply I've sent, back-forward buttons, or maybe a Preview-like multi-page w/previews interface showing each of the replies I've sent to that email.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get the earliest reply I've sent.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a"
