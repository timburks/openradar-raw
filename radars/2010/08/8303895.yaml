    description: "Included sample code: http://cl.ly/2852bb6085f1f2c16b64\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen UIImagePickerController is set to accept only videos (not photos), it does not allow access to Photo Albums except the Camera Roll. This occurs whether or not there are videos in other albums.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure an iPhone/iOS device such that it has some videos in the Camera Roll, and some videos in other Photo Albums (e.g., synced from iPhoto).\r\n2. Download the included sample project and run it on the device.\r\n3. Press the SourceTypePhotoLibrary and SourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum buttons. Note the configurations of the image pickers that appear.\r\n4. Turn the \"Videos Only\" switch to On. Press the buttons again and note the image pickers.\r\n\r\n(See Classes/ImagePickerFailViewController.m)\r\n- SourceTypePhotoLibrary corresponds to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary.\r\n- SourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum corresponds to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum.\r\n- Turning the Videos Only switch on corresponds to setting the picker's mediaTypes property to an array containing only kUTTypeMovie.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The SourceTypePhotoLibrary button should display the \"Photo Albums\" list of albums (including Camera Roll and other albums, e.g. those synced from iPhoto), and tapping an album should show the list of thumbnails in that album.\r\n- The SourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum button should display the list of thumbnails in the Camera Roll.\r\n- The Videos Only switch should control whether videos or photos are shown in the list of thumbnails, but should not change the image picker configuration that appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTurning the Videos Only switch to On causes the SourceTypePhotoLibrary to display the Camera Roll instead of the Photo Albums list. There is no way to pick videos from other albums."
