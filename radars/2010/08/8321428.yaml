    description: "I haven't been able to narrow down the exact cause, but it seems that sometimes text on a page with CSS animation and/or javascript can at times be rendered in what seems like a non-anti-alaised state. On pages where this happens the same text is always jagged.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've found this problem in a website that I'm currently working on that isn't yet live. However, I've also found this happens on one of apple's own pages:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/macmini/design.html\r\n\r\nif you scroll down to the very bottom of the page, all the gray navigation text in the box will be jagged: http://cl.ly/10bdc7ef5ece75e000f3\r\n\r\nHowever, clicking on the \"Removable panel off\" link higher in the page will fix the problem:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/ac3199f924948d8dabe3\r\n\r\nre-adding the removable panel will make the text jagged once again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe text should be smooth no matter what.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSome text is jagged."
