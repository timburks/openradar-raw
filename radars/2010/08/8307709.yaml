    description: "13-Aug-2010 11:54 AM PCWiz Computer:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nDrawing anything at a position using decimal coordinates results in blurry drawing. For example, drawing an image at {5.5, 2.0} will result in a blurry image. Quartz should automatically round these to the nearest whole pixel, as I cannot see any reason why someone would place something at a decimal coordinate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDraw anything at a position using decimal coordinates. e.g. CGRectMake(0.5, 2.5, 10, 10);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA clear drawing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA blurry drawing, as a result of the position not being rounded off to the nearest whole pixel.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:"
