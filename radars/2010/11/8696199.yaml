    description: "When debugging a Core Location app (using location and heading updates) and hanging in a break point for some time, we get in the log:\r\n\r\nERROR,Time,312205175.525,Function,\"void CLClientHandleRegistrationTimerExpiry(__CFRunLoopTimer*, void*)\",Registration timer expired, but client is still registering!\r\n\r\nAfter that we don't receive any Core Location updates. This is very nasty. Also it's hard to detect such a situation where Core Location updates suddenly stop coming.\r\n\r\nWe suspect this also happens during normal deployment. But it's hard to prove without the debugger being attached."
