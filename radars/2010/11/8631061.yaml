    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nIf you have more than one iTunes account, (Account A, and Account B, for example, for different family members), iBooks will notice and ask if you want to change bookmarks sync to the currently logged in account. The only options are 'Sync' and 'Don't Sync'. Choosing 'Don't Sync' turns off syncing entirely, instead of dismissing the account sync change request.\r\n\r\nThis is very destructive, as now if you switch syncing back on you could end up losing your place in a book you were reading on another device.\r\n\r\nTO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\n• Log in with Account A to the App Store/iTunes Store/iBookstore\r\n• Enable bookmark syncing in iBooks\r\n• Quit iBooks\r\n• Switch iTunes account to Account B (in Settings, App Store, or iTunes Store)\r\n• Launch iBooks\r\n• iBooks will ask if you want to change your syncing to Account B ('Sync' or 'Don't Sync')\r\n• Choose 'Don't Sync'\r\n\r\n• Syncing is now disabled entirely, instead of just dismissing the previous dialogue\r\n• iBooks bookmark syncing is now turned off when it should not have been\r\n• Both options in that dialogue are destructive\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\n• 'Don't Sync' should simply not switch accounts instead of turning off syncing, or there should be a third 'Cancel' button in the dialogue\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\n\r\n• 'Don't Sync' disables syncing entirely"
