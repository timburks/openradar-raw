    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nPlease provide an API to display the current Settings bundle for an Application as a view controller inside the app. This would allow Settings to go in the Settings app, and also be displayed inside the app itself if need be, depending on the current context.\r\n\r\nThis would allow for a singular, dedicated place to set settings for any application, while also providing consistency to apps without requiring a user to leave the app to adjust settings or a developer to re-invent the wheel for a Settings UI in their app.\r\n\r\nA developer has already provided a solution to do this ( https://github.com/steipete/InAppSettings ) but I believe there should be an official system API for such."
