    description: "Summary:\r\nOn BlackBerry OS, messaging apps such as Twitter and Facebook can integrate with the SMS app, such as Twitter direct messages coming in as a text message, although not through the SMS network. Other applications such as Facebook can show their \"push notification\" type events (although not necessarily push) as a \"message\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the rest of these steps apply to a feature request."
