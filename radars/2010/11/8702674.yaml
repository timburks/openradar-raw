    description: "Summary: Please expose API to allow multiple selection in a UITableView\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: n/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results: n/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:  n/a\r\n\r\nRegression:  n/a\r\n\r\nNotes: Apparently there is a private API to allow for multiple selection in a UITableView, as used in the Mail App to delete multiple messages in one go.\r\n\r\n- (UITableViewCellEditingStyle)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView editingStyleForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {\r\n    return 3; // Undocumented constant\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis functionality would be very useful in a number of Apps I am designing, as I am sure it would be for a lot of other developers.\r\n\r\nIdeally you would have the ability to select multiple lines in the table view then have a button to call an action to apply to all selected items, rather than just delete.\r\n\r\nPlease expose this API (or similar) to enable this functionality for developers designing Apps for the App Store."
