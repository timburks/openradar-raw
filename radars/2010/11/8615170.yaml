    description: "Summary:\r\nI've setup an alarm clock at 7:30 (am) for weekdays Mon-Fri. On Sunday, Oct 31 daylight savings time in Europe ended and the iPhone automatically switched correctly from CEST to CET. The next alarm rang one hour too late.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alarm should ring a 7:30 CET.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alarm rang at 8:30 CET.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn the US and Canada, DST ends one week later. If you're quick you can try to reproduce it by creating an alarm entry as described above. Unfortunately, I can try to reproduce the exact same issue by myself only in one year from now ;)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's strange that the alarm rang one hour too late. If the alarm system would not honor DST changes at all, I'd have expected to ring one hour too early at 6:30.\r\n\r\nA while ago, I reported a similar issue involving traveling to different time zones: rdar://7878342"
