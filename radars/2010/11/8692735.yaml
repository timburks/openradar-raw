    description: "Summary: If your app's name contains a space, attempting to upload an app to the Mac App Store via Xcode Organizer will fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a project in Xcode, and set the Product Name in build settings to \"Sound Studio\". Prepare an app entry in iTunes Connect for this app. Add the appropriate resources (icons, etc.) and keys (category, etc.). Build and Archive the app. In the Organizer, select the archive and click Validate. It should validate. Click the Submit button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: It should accept the previously validated package.\r\n\r\nActual Results: It gives the error 'The applications \"Sound Studio\" could not be submitted to the App Store because of the following issues: \r\n1. Apple's web service operation was not successful\r\n2. Unable to authenticate the package: 405537804.itmsp\r\n3. ERROR ITMS-4000: \"Line 5 column 56: bad character content for element at XPath /package/software_assets/asset/data_file/file_name\"\r\n\r\nRegression: This does not happen when the Product Name does not have a space. The same bug happens with iOS app submissions, but the workaround is to create a zip archive of the app manually, and then upload it with the Application Loader. \r\n\r\nNotes: Others also have this problem: https://devforums.apple.com/message/326844"
