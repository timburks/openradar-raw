    description: "11-Oct-2010 05:46 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nSummary:\r\niChat unfortunately does not reconnect if the internet connection was temporarily unavailable. It would be convenient to use the iChat menuBar item to reconnect to all services (I've configured AIM, Bonjour and 2 Jabber based services) at once. Unfortunately, the entry \"Available\" only does this if all accounts are disconnected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate two or more iChat accounts. Connect one of them, disconnect the other one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSelecting \"Available\" should connect the disconnected account and leave the already connected account alone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSelecting \"Available\" does nothing.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOf course this is only a cosmetic fix to the core issue that iChat doesn't reconnect automatically.\r\nThe Mac is behind a NAT DSL router (AVM Fritz!Box).\r\n\r\n02-Nov-2010 02:07 AM DARIN MARSHALL :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information: \r\n\r\nThis is the correct behavior, based upon how the issue is described.\r\n\r\n02-Nov-2010 11:54 AM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nThe behavior is not logical: The \"Offline\" menu item does work on mixed online/offline accounts. The \"Available\" item does not."
