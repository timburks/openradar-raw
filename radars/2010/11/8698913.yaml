    description: "24-Nov-2010 01:42 AM Pepi Zawodsky:\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter Updating Mac OS X Server from 10.6.4 to 10.6.5 v1.1 it recognizes its own serial number on the LAN and subsequently marks itself as illegal-serial-number making the server unusable. (No Login possible, LDAP down, no administration of services)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nXerve with both ethernet interfaces on the same network (broadcast domain) with different IPs. (not trunked). Update to 10.6.5 Server, restart. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA servers own serial number should NOT invalidate itself, just because I make use of both ethernet connections of an Xserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSerial Number invalidates itself, server must be restored from backup to be used again, causing severe downtime and loss of productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nXserve with both ethernet interfaces connected to the same broadcast domain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe same bug was already present in 10.5 and also 10.6.0. It was reintroduced the second time now.\r\nI'm loosing confidence in Apple's commitment to server products. Quality Control of Mac OS X Server is becoming worse and worse, Xserve discontinued. Is Apple becoming a consumer entertainment company that only cares for iOS?\r\n\r\nDon't forget your professional market!"
