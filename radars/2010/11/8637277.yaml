    description: "Summary: The iPad is a great way to share photos with friends and family members. However, it also allows them access to the owner's personal email accounts, apps with private data and address book (amongst other things).\r\n\r\nI would like to propose a kiosk/slideshow mode. When the owner of the iPad activates this mode (in the Photos app, and perhaps in any standard movie controller), multitasking and returning to the home screen are disabled. In addition, the current photo album is the only one allowed to be accessed. This mode would be active until the owner double-clicks the home button and a passcode prompt appears.\r\n\r\nI believe this would be a better, worry-free way to share photos with family and friends. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
