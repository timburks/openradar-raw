    description: "Summary:\r\nAFP share with full read + file write/delete capability does not allow to create or write files via Finder, TextEdit or other native Mac apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new afp share on OSX server with the following permissions:\r\n * Read Attributes\r\n * Read Extended Attributes\r\n * List Folder Contents (Read Data)\r\n * Traverse Folder (Execute File)\r\n * Read Permissions\r\n * Create Files (Write Data)\r\n * Delete\r\n\r\n2. Mount the share on OSX client\r\n\r\n3. Try to copy new file into share via Finder, create new file in Finder or TextEdit, open existing file in TextEdit, modify it and save.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFile save succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFinder does not allow to create file. TextEdit reports: The document “untitled.txt” could not be saved. You don’t have permission. To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFile operations done via shell, like:\r\n\r\ntouch /Volumes/TestShare/file1\r\necho 123 > /Volumes/TestShare/file2\r\necho 456 >> /Volumes/TestShare/file2\r\n\r\nwork as expected. Also, some OSX applications like TextMate or Adobe Photoshop also work as expected. NSFileManager's -createFileAtPath:contents:attributes: works as expected."
