    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes Connect uses 'UK English' localization for apps sold on the Singapore App Store. As a result, the screenshots that appear on the Singapore App Store use the same set as 'UK English', if any.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that Singaporeans use British English, that's where the similarities end.\r\n\r\nDisplay of times, for example, are in 12-hour format with AM/PM symbols just like the US. Days however start on Monday instead of Sundays.\r\n\r\nLocalization between the different English languages are really more about the date and time display instead of the language, since developers are unable to target 'UK English' or 'English' or 'Australia English' within their apps.\r\n\r\nI've found that the Australian English localization is much more appropriate to Singapore App Store.\r\n\r\nFor example, both countries use 12-hour format with AM/PM symbols (also reflected by the iPhone settings). Next, Singapore starts its calendar on Mondays instead of Sundays (currently wrongly reflected by the iPhone's regional settings, filed bug report #8103166).\r\n\r\nCould you please map the Singapore App Store localization to Australia English instead, because it's really weird for people here in Singapore to see 24-hour times in app's screenshots.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
