    description: "A volume control was added to the multitasking bar in iOS 4.2 for iPhone/iPod touch. However, unlike the iPad, it does not have a brightness control. It would be handy if one could swipe left of the volume control to access a brightness control.\r\n\r\n[I adjust the brightness of my iPhone about twice a day: once when I read in bed and once when I wake up in the morning. Iâ€™m probably not the only one who uses Settings every day just to adjust the brightness of their screen.]"
