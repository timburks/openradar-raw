    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's no Calendar App on the Simulator so it makes working with EKEventKit painful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse EKEventKit, look for the Calendar app on the simulator, oh, no, there isn't such a thing :)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMuch like there's an AddressBook app I'd like to see a Calendar app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo Calendar App\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm not gonna submit a Bug Report but the same applies to SMS and other Frameworks which now obliges one to use the device. One solution would be to have WiFi/BT deployment (cables aren't cool, you know) and some kind of VNC to the device."
