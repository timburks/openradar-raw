    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen animating the fontSize property of a multiline CATextLayer,  the animation which used to be a smooth cross fade between beginning and ending states, now rewraps the text after each frame of animation that the font size of the text is incremented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. layout sublayers setting original fontSize.\r\n2. when a layer is clicked, relayout sublayers with an increased fontSize for the selected layer and increase it's frame to fit the text containing the newly sized text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSmooth animation between initial font size and final font size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIn iOS 4.0 and later (particularly 4.2) the fontSize is seemingly incremented throughout the animation and as it is incremented the text is rewrapped, which causes a very choppy, ugly animation for multiline CATextLayers that have a fixed width.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\niOS 3.2 fixed this bug which was present in early beta builds (of 3.2) and the GM contained smooth cross fade animations between beginning and ending states.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached are 4 screen recordings of the bug:  The animation in question on iOS 3.2 (slow and fast versions) and on iOS 4.2 GM seed (slow and fast versions).  Note that while these are recorded in the simulator we have verified that they perform similarly on device."
