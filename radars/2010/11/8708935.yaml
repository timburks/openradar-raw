    description: "29-Nov-2010 06:57 PM Monroe Williams:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOne of the codepaths for canceling out of creating a new user causes a random account on the server to be deleted without confirmation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Open Workgroup Manager and connect to an OpenDirectory master for which you have full admin privileges.\r\n- Click on \"New User\"\r\n- Click on the \"UID\" column header in the user list\r\n- In the \"Save Changes?\" sheet, click either \"Don't Save\" or \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCleanly back out of new user creation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSometimes (I'm not sure what other factors are involved), a random account on the server is deleted without any confirmation.  /Library/Logs/PasswordService/ApplePasswordServer.Server.log shows it like a normal account deletion.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've been trying to figure out how accounts occasionally disappear from our server since the 10.4 days.  This bug has been around for a LONG time, and I finally saw it happen under controlled conditions under 10.6.4.  Fortunately for me, 10.6 server no longer deletes the user's mail when this happens, so I was able to recover by recreating the account.\r\n\r\n\r\n21-Jul-2011 05:19 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nPlease verify this issue in Mac OS X Lion GM Build 11A511 and update this report with your results.
