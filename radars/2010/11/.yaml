    description: "When I visit http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/blog/please-stop-using-background-color-in-your-css/  I get a prompt asking me to allow Safari to use the downloaded font. This seems egregious, especially in the light of many, many more sites using custom fonts going forward.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this is dependent on some setting that people can have enabled or not. I apparently get the warning whereas so far others do not. I also only have it on some sites, but not most that use downloaded fonts. This seems to defeat the purpose of the security warning.\r\n"
