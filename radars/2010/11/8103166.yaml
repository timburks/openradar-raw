    description: "Summary: When an iPad/iPhone is localised via Settings.app > General > International > Region Format to Singapore, the Calendar.app starts the week on Sunday instead of Monday. However, this is not correct. Singapore follows UK/Australia convention in calendar and starts week on Monday instead of Sunday.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Set Settings.app > General > International > Region Format to Singapore\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Calendar.app should start week on Monday instead of Sunday\r\n\r\nActual Results: Calendar.app starts week on Sunday instead of Monday\r\n\r\nRegression: Affects all iOS devices from iPhone to iPad\r\n\r\nNotes: Currently Singapore users are localizing their region format to UK or Australia to get week to start on Monday. However in UK region format, time changes to 24h format. In both UK and Australia, Google search is localized to google.co.uk and google.com.au which will not deliver region specific search results for Singapore users"
