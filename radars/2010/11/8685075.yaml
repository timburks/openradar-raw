    description: "Summary:\r\nThe autocorrection dictionary file on iOS doesn't seem to be ordered by frequency of word usage. If it were, it would aid typing and reduce frustration (and posts to http://damnyouautocorrect.com/ -- a very popular blog dedicated to autocorrect gaffes). Common words shouldn't be replaced by \"gonnorhea\" and \"hoosegow\". I don't even know what hoosegow means!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSlightly mistype a common word, like \"hilarious\" in a text field when autocorrection is on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAutocorrect would select the most common word, e.g. \"hilarious\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAutocorrect suggests an obscure word, e.g. \"hoosegow\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis affects all iOS versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI presume the /System/Library/TextInput/TextInput_en.bundle/Unigrams-en_US.dat and associated index file (other files for other languages) file is ordered alphabetically. It seems that at no compute or storage cost, the dictionary could be reordered in order of popularity/usage. This might cut back on incorrect autocorrect suggestions.  This would require re-sorting the list in order of usage, but that seems like a fairly trivial thing to do. I have attached some screenshots."
