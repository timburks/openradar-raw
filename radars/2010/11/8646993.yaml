    description: "There is a selection state redraw issue that occurs when a NSTableView is in a layer backed view hierarchy. Ultimately multiple rows in the table can appear selected.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nplace a NSTableView enclosed in a NSScrollView in a layer backed view hierarchy and provide enough data to the table such that it is scrollable. ensure the table is configured for single selection only.\r\n\r\nselect a row near the top of the table, then scroll down to the bottom and select another row. scroll back up to the top of the table and the first row will still appear as though it is selected.  The array controller that backs the table correctly indicates that the last selected row is the only selection for the table.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nit should behave the same as if it is not in a layer backed view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nmultiple rows appear selected to the user even though the backing array controller only shows there to be the single selected row (the last one clicked, as it should be)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\ndisable the layer backing of the parent view and watch the selection redraw state behave properly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://people.ambrosiasw.com/~rudy/radr/8646993.zip"
