    description: "SUMMARY: A call to the fcntl$UNIX2003 function hangs (i.e., never\r\nreturns).  F_SETLKW calls are repeatedly made by two processes to\r\nwrite-lock the same region of a memory-mapped file.  One of the \r\nprocesses will eventually hang, waiting for the call to return.  The\r\nproblem is new with Mac OS X 10.5.2: the programs worked correctly on\r\nall previous versions of Mac OS X and also work on current and former \r\nversions (dating back to 1994) of Solaris, IRIX, HP-UX, AIX, and Linux.\r\nThe programs conform to the Unix version 2 standard. \r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE: The programs are part of the LDM package, which I\r\nsupport.  The problem can be reproduced by running the LDM system and\r\nwaiting until one of the processes hangs.  This usually occurs withing\r\none day.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS: Both processes repeatedly write-lock and unlock the\r\nsame region of the memory-mapped file.  They should be able to take\r\nturns, indefinitely.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS: One of the processes hangs after about one day.  gdb(1)\r\nindicates that the process is waiting for a call to fcntl$UNIX2003 to\r\nreturn.  Interestingly, attaching to the hung process with the debugger\r\nand then exiting the debugger causes the hung process to become unhung.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION: This problem has only been seen on a Mac OS X 10.5.0 system\r\nand a Mac OS X 10.5.2 system.  The problem was never seen on a Mac OS X\r\n10.4 system.\r\n\r\nADDENDAE: The problem occurs on Mac OS X 10.6 as well. It also occurs even if only one process uses the memory-mapped file."
