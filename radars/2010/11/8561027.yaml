    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you delete an iOS app from any iDevice and redownload it on the device, it displays the price and asks you to confirm your purchase. An end user, myself included, would process this as \"Oh, I have to pay again\" and they will potentially not go through with the process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDelete any paid app from your device. Find it in the app store, and click buy now.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFirst, I expect that it would indicate it has been paid for previously and you can download it for free. When clicking on the button, I would expect it to jump directly to the home page and begin downloading, perhaps having prompted for your password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou're prompted to confirm your decision to purchase despite the fact you've previously paid for the app, and only after you've confirmed your apparently willingness to pay for it again will the App Store tell you, \"oh, looks like you already bought this, it's free\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a large issue with beta testers who frequently have to remove apps and \"repurchase\" them at a release."
