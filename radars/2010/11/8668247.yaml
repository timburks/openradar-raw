    description: "15-Nov-2010 11:26 AM Billy Mabray:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen using a UIViewPrintFormatter to print a UIWebView, the UIWebView changes, apparently applying the print styles on screen before sending the view to the Print Center.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDownload the PrintWebView sample code from the Developer Center. Build and run the project. Observe the UIWebView before and after printing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUIWebView should not change, but the printed version should use the proper print stylings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBoth the UIWebView and the printed version of that view have print stylings applied.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've attached screenshots, but my guess is you guys already know about this and are working on it."
