    description: "Summary:\r\nIn apps using AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient sound the mini iPod controls in the task switcher (2x home button, swipe to left) are disabled. This is unexpected since the AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient category is designed for mixing other (e.g. iPod) audio with the app's audio.\r\n\r\nAlso, the mixing does work if the iPod audio was already playing when launching the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nStart any app that uses AVAudioPlayer and the AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient category. For instance, use the \"Metronome\" sample app and add the following lines in MetronomeView.m, line 141:\r\n\r\n\t\tNSError *setCategoryError = nil;\r\n\t\t[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory: AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient error: &setCategoryError];\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter launching the Metronome app and starting the audio, double clicking the home button and swiping to left reveals the mini iPod control buttons. They should be enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mini iPod control buttons are disabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNever worked for me. Reproducible in iOS 4.1 and 4.2.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've tried the AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback combined with setting kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryMixWithOthers. Then, the iPod controls do work as expected. Unfortunately, AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback is not suitable for productivity apps because it doesn't obey the mute and lock switch."
