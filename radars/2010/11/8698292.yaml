    description: "Summary:\r\niPhoto has far too many modes, particularly in album mode. They require multiple transitions time-wasting steps to access common controls.\r\n\r\nEdit view: I should be able to both crop and title a photo without switching the right-side controls.\r\n\r\nAlbum page editing mode:\r\n* There is a small squarish thumbnail page control, and a short page control without thumbnail. I don't know what causes them to switch, but it's confusing and I have no control over which is active.\r\n* Provide a capability to see 4 pages at a time. Reorganizing pictures from 3 pages is incredibly awkward, and requires multiple trips between 2-up and all-pages views. Even working with 2 pages may require rearranging pages and jumping between modes. As an example, take 4 2-photo pages and consolidate those 8 photos onto a single 8-photo page -- the number of wasted operations is awful.\r\n* When a photo slot is selected, I cannot change layout in the main screen. I have to click the wood-grain background to get the page-design popup, or change the right side from Photos to Design. On the other hand, I also cannot change the layout of the facing page. I have to click the facing page to select a slot, then click above to deselect, and *then* I can click the layout popup.\r\n* When right-clicking a page, offer the Remove Page option.\r\n* When removing a page whose adjacent mate has no photos, remove both pages.\r\n* On a 27\" iMac, the pages are sized as if there was no right-side popdown. This means about 1/3 of a page is inaccessible. When the Add Page/Design/Photos popup is up, resize the pages.\r\n* The Layout photo counts should also be usable as a 2-level menu, so I could click on 2 Photos, then select the actual 2-photo layout desired, without releasing and clicking again.\r\n\r\n* There are not enough layouts for portrait photos. The thumbnails are almost all landscape, and iPhoto doesn't make good use of tall photos in the layouts.\r\n\r\nAlbum multi-page editing mode:\r\n* I should be able to drag photos from one slot to another.\r\n\r\nUndo:\r\n* I changed layout from 2pp to 8pp, added 6 more photos, then used Undo. This un-placed the 6 photos.\r\n* Then I used the Redo command. The layout was returned to 8pp, but the 6 photos were not restored.\r\n\r\nPopups\r\nPhotos should show number of photos currently displayed, whether All, Unplaced, or Placed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhoto 8 was much less modal."
