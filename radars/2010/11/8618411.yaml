    description: "When my app initializes a video file the video starts playing immediately, without a play command.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Download and install \"Clean My Screen\" (or the Lite version) on an iPad\r\n2) start the app\r\n2) Quit (the first time the app does something that obfuscate the bug)\r\n3) start the app again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should wait until the user touches the screen before the video starts playing and the screen gets cleaned\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe video starts playing immediately. It is covered by an overlay image so you don't see it, but you can hear its sound. When you click the screen the video is shown but fast forwards to the current frame.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis happens on iPads running the latest GM build. Also in the Simulator. It did not happen in 4.0 and 4.1 on the iPhone, I also happens on an iPod running 4.2 GM.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAll I do is issue the following command at start to preload the movie\r\n\r\n   moviePlayer = [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL:MovieURL];\r\n\r\nThe movie starts to play immediately, without me issuing a \r\n\r\n   [moviePlayer play];\r\n\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nI can work around (and have a version that works that way) by issuing the initWithContentURL:MovieURL when I actually want to play the movie, but that adds a few extra seconds before the playback starts."
