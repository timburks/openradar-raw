    description: "24-Nov-2010 11:39 AM Jim Dovey:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf -[UIView setNeedsLayout] is called on a background thread which then exits, the pthread cleanup process causes CoreAnimation to run the layout process for that view's layer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSpawn a background thread and call -setNeedsLayout on a view from that thread. Then exit the thread.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe main thread would check the 'needsLayout' flag and perform layout there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCoreAnimation, in cleaning up some thread-specific-data, causes -layoutSubviews to be invoked on the background thread, which is in the process of shutting down, thus causing parts of the Foundation runtime to go awry (specifically, [[NSThread currentThread] threadDictionary] returns nil, causing problems for my app but also potentially for other system APIs).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have filed a companion bug to this one suggesting that the documentation around -setNeedsLayout should be updated to specifically state that the method should only be called from the main thread. This is at <rdar://problem/8699372>."
