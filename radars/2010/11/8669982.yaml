    description: "Summary:\r\nA NIB file is originally not localized and the app installed on the device or simulator. After localizing the NIB file and Running the app again, the app on the device or in the simulator apparently still contains the non-localized NIB file. This causes the localization to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with the template \"View based application\". Edit the \"<Appname>ViewController.xib\" to include a UILabel \"non-localized\".\r\n2. Install the app\r\n3. Make the \"<Appname>ViewController.xib\" localizable and add one localization. Modify the label of the localized XIBs to be include the name of the language (e.g. \"English\", \"German\").\r\n4. Install the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should display the label \"English\" or \"German\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app displays the label \"non-localized\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happens on both the device (running iOS 4.1) and the simulator.\r\nI witnessed several situations where files were not deleted on the device even if needed. One example involved changed provisioning settings (needed for IAP sandbox testing). In those situations, the only solution is to delete the app from the device. This causes additional debugging effort because the developer expects that the installer replicates the directory structure exactly on the device."
