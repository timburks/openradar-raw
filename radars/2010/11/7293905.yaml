    description: "Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nI have noticed a problem in the Finder. If you connect your Mac to a PC via ethernet (and the IP settings etc are correct) then the PC will appear in the sidebar. So, if you activate airport for connecting to another network where are also Windows based PCs then the first PC will disappear from sidebar.\r\n\r\nThis happens in 10.6.1. and I also tested this with an employee from AppleCare. \r\n\r\nThis is really a bug.\r\n\r\nIf you would replace the Windows PCs with other Macs then they won't disappear.\r\n\r\nSo there's a bug in the Finder or in the network layer.\r\n\r\nI hope this bug will be fixed so that Mac OS X can really be the best OS.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
