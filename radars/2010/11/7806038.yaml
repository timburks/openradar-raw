    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, there is no system-declared uniform type identifier associated with screen savers. Attempting to retrieve the UTI associated with a screen saver results in a dynamically generated UTI. Consider adding a system-declared UTI associated with the file extensions .saver and .slideSaver than can be used to correctly identify screen saver bundles."
