    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Media Playback controls is missing a screen brightness control on iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDouble press the home button to activate the app switcher dock on iOS. Swipe to the media controls to the left of the apps. There is a very useless volume control slider. One can actually already control volume with the side buttons, the earphones remote and a UISlider in the iPod application.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd want to have a brightness control there!\r\nEvery device supporting iOS 4.2.1 already does have hardware buttons for volume control, so it's totally unnecessary to reproduce that element AGAIN. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTotally redundant volume control appears on iPhone/iPod touch. iPad shows both. I definitely want to have an easy and quick way to adjust screen brightness. There are already numerous ways to control volume."
