    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari still uses the old-style SSL renegotiation described in CVE-2009-3555 and http://www.phonefactor.com/sslgap/ .  Safari stops connecting to servers requiring renegotiation and certificates as soon as those servers stop allowing old-style renegotiation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start with a fresh \"login\" Keychain\r\n\r\n2. Obtain a client x.509 certificate\r\n  if you don't have a CA handy: see http://foaf.me/Tests/simple_KEYGEN_CreateClientCertificate.php\r\n\r\n3. Visit a page that does NOT require renegotiation on a site running Apache2 and OpenSSL 0.9.8 > 0.9.8m\r\n\r\n4. Visit a page that DOES require renegotiation, again on a site running Apache2 and OpenSSL 0.9.8 > 0.9.8m \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nboth 3. and 4. result in normal page loads\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. loads normally\r\n4. Safari shows the error \r\n  Safari can't open the page \"https://HOST/PATH/\" because Safari can't establish a secure connection to the server \"HOST\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas never worked.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's been over a year since the CVE-2009-3555 was reported, and about 9 months since RFC 5746 was published.  As of this writing, Firefox, IE, Chrome, and Opera support RFC 5746, whereas people using Safari are locked out of certificate-protected content on servers/directories requiring renegotiation."
