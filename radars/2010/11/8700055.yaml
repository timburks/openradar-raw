    description: "24-Nov-2010 03:26 PM Kevin Ross:\r\nSummary:\r\nWe are trying to deploy a dashcode project to a specific folder by using applescript to automate the process.  Using the script below, we are able to export the project to any given folder.  The problem is that the index.html file does not contain any data.  All of the other files seem to export fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new Safari Dashcode project.\r\n2. Save it to the desktop as \"Untitled\"\r\n3. Run the following script:\r\n===========  Applescript used to export the project  ===========\r\nset ReportViewExportDir to (((path to home folder) as string) & \"Desktop:Untitled\")\r\nset ReportViewProject to (ReportViewExportDir & \".dcproj\")\r\n\r\ntell application \"Dashcode\"\r\n\topen ReportViewProject\r\n\tset current_document to (first document of application \"Dashcode\")\r\n\texport current_document to ReportViewExportDir\r\n\tclose current_document\r\n\tquit\r\nend tell\r\n===============================================\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect the project to be exported to the desktop in a folder called \"Untitled\" that is identical to opening Dashcode and choosing \"Save to Diskâ€¦\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProject is exported but the index.html file is empty.  All other files in the project seem unaffected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
