    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen switching from Private Browsing mode to regular mode, invoking Undo Close Tab causes a crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Safari and enter Private Browsing mode\r\n2. Visit any web pages in two tabs\r\n3. Turn off Private Browsing mode\r\n4. Close one of the two tabs\r\n5. Choose Edit -> Undo Close Tab (or just Command-Z)\r\n6. Crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Undo Close Tab command should be unavailable, as the closed tab was created while in Private Browsing mode.  Allowing undo for tabs created in Private Browsing may defeat the purpose.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari crashes."
