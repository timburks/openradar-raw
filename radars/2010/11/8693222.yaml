    description: "Summary: In the Audio Unit effect plug-in that Apple provides with the system called AUMultibandCompressor, if its custom Cocoa UI is loaded and shown before it is initialized with AudioUnitInitialize(), it will crash the host app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Build and run CocoaAUHost (http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/CocoaAUHost/). \r\n2. Select AUType:effect.\r\n3. Select Audio Unit: AUMultibandCompressor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Audio Unit effect plug-in's UI should stay open. Or it should return an error message or log to the console before it crashes.\r\n\r\nActual results: Application crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression: This also happens in 10.6.5 (10H574). This does not happen in Mac OS X 10.5.8. \r\n\r\nNotes: Crash log included."
