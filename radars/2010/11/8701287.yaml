    description: "25-Nov-2010 02:53 PM Pieter de Bie:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf you drag two or more quarantined files (like Python scripts) on an application, and Cocoa asks for the user if they are sure they want to open it, even after pressing \"Open\", only one file is opened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1 a) Get someone to send you two python scripts through iChat, or\r\n   b) Download this file twice from within Safari: https://gist.github.com/715416 (option-click the 'raw' link), or\r\n   c) You can probably also download the attached testfile 'test.py' twice with Safari\r\n2) Select both files and drag them on TextEdit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA dialog asking the user if they are sure they want to open both files, then when the user selects \"open\", both files should open.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe user is asked if it wants to open of the two files. If the user selects 'Open', only one file is opened.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis also occurs on 10.5.8. Does not happen on systems that don't have quarantine (OS X 10.4 and previous).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis happens in all Cocoa applications accepting files. It does not only affect new applications, existing users of current applications are also affected."
