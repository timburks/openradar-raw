    description: "Summary:\r\nIn garbage-collected applications, -[NSView viewWillMoveToWindow:] is called with a nil window parameter after the view has been finalized.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project. Close the window. Switch back and forth between applications repeatedly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpon closing the window, a log message of the form “<InnocuousLookingView: 0x200079480> moved from <NSWindow: 0x200073bc0> to (null)”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSaid log message occurs at a later point, and is immediately followed by two of these:\r\n“ResurrectedView(82622,0x7fff70210c20) malloc: resurrection error for object 0x200079480 while assigning {unallocated-or-stack}(0x0)[5389112] = InnocuousLookingView[160](0x200079480)\r\ngarbage pointer stored into reachable memory, break on auto_zone_resurrection_error to debug”\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAn apparently identical error was mentioned on cocoa-dev in May 2009, suggesting it happened in Mac OS X 10.5.7:\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2009/May/msg01480.html\r\n\r\nIt may or may not have happened earlier than then.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor my purposes, it suffices to return early when passed a nil parameter.\r\n\r\nDocumentation states: “Subclasses can override this method to perform whatever actions are necessary.” No restrictions are specified."
