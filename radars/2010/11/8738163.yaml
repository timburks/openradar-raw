    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease add framework level timeouts to SKProductsRequest.  Last night the IAP sandbox was down for several hours.  SKProductRequests would start and never fire a delegate callback.  There was no indication from the framework that there were server or connectivity issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe StoreKit framework would issue a timeout after, say, 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe StoreKit API call never returns.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
