    description: "Summary:\r\nFor *some* Table Views, it actually makes sense to not have to play around with a TableViewDataSource and visualize/design the data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to build a simple TableView with a fix amount of items (eg In App Settings)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like to have a Visual Way to add cells to a TableView\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe TableView in IB makes not so much sense in its actual state.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAgain, this is for \"some\" data. Not for an Address Book, but well for settings, for example. I mean this for very small table views, like 10 rows, maybe even 5. The 2 key benefits would be:\r\n\r\n- faster coding/design\r\n- feedback about design, without having to launch the app."
