    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an application has been approved by Apple and is now \"pending developer release\", there's no way you (as a developer) can reject the application and start over with a new binary without first releasing the approved binary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet your application approved by Apple, and then try to reject it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that I could reject a binary, even though it had been approved by Apple - it could contain bugs severe enough that makes me not want to release it to the public.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't reject the application.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
