    description: "The iPod nano is wristwatch-sized, and I, like many others, use the iPod as a wristwatch.\r\n\r\nIt would be incredibly useful if the iPod nano could connect to the iPhone wirelessly and display data or information from the phone; for example, unread Mail messages or SMS (or the unread count of each).\r\n \r\nThe iPod nano as a glance-able wristwatch widget platform could be immensely powerful, but even the ability to see unread message counts or read the messages themselves would be a major boon to iPhone users.\r\n\r\nPlease consider some sort of bluetooth connection between the two platforms for future revisions.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n-S"
