    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting a Black StatusBar in the Info.plist this information isn't used by the nib for the Simulated Interface Elements\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd \"UIStatusBarStyleBlackOpaque\" to your Info.plist\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen opening MainWindow.nib, the Simulated StatusBar should be black\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Simulated StatusBar is still grey.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's a bit cumbersome to have to go in each screen and simulate. I'm not saying it should be \"by default\" applied, but at least for newly added XIBs."
