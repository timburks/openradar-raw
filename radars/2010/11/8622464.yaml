    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen switching between Spaces, occasionally the Dock.app can get into a state where it will prevent keyboard events from being delivered to the frontmost application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSwitch Spaces.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe Spaces switching animation moves between spaces, the Spaces HUD fades, and keyboard events work in the new frontmost application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Spaces switching animation moves between spaces, the Spaces HUD remains on screen, and keyboard events do not work in the new frontmost application.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot reliably reproduce this, there are some symptoms which I believe might be related.\r\n\r\n- I generally use the keyboard shortcuts that involve the arrow keys (in Sys Prefs > Expose & Spaces > Spaces > \"To switch between spaces\"). I use the Control modifier key to invoke this.\r\n- This is not reliable, but I have noticed the problem seems to occur more frequently when I attempt to press a Command key combination while the Spaces animation is switching. I generally notice this when switching to a Space with a Twitter client on, which I quickly press the key combinations Command-R, Command-1, and Command-2.\r\n- The only way to restore keyboard access is to kill the Dock process (which launchd will then relaunch). This fix is not guaranteed, however, and sometimes I can only get one Spaces switch before the Dock hang issue reoccurs. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.\r\n- All keyboard events that relate to switching spaces continue to work normally when in this state.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis happens to me daily on 2 separate machines (and has happened on 2 other machines), running both Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 variants. If there is *anything* I can do to aid in debugging (e.g. set a user defaults key or install a custom Dock.app build with extensive logging), please let me know.\r\n\r\nI suspect the issue is related to the switching animation itself. A user defaults flag to disable that animation would likely mask the issue (as well as speed up my workflow). :)\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the issue reported in rdar://8570845, this bug happened immediately prior to being affected by rdar://8570845."
