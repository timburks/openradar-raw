    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iPad the \"media bar\" has both Volume and brightness control. On iPhone, however, there's only Volume.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSwipe to the right in the multi task menu to reveal the media controls. Swipe again, there it is, the useless volume control :-)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince Volume has hardware buttons (aside on the 1st gen. iPod touch not supported by iOS 4 anyways...), it would make more sense to have a brightness control there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a volume control. Nice to have both on the iPad, but if I'd have to choose, I'd go for Brightness"
