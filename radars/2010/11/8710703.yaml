    description: "0-Nov-2010 03:41 PM Kevin O'Regan:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe 'Report a problem' link/button in the iTunes and device AppStores only sends the customer's problem to Apple. There appears to be no means for Apple, having determined that it is not AppStore/Purchase related to make these reports available to the app author.\r\n\r\nHave recevied bad reviews in the past from people who have submitted several issues via the 'Report a Problem' system and have grown frustrated with the lack of response from a developer. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpect that Apple, after checking that the report is not related to offensive content, security etc would make the reports available to the developer. Suggest that iTunesConnect would be a suitable location to publish the reports.\r\n\r\nIt should also be possible for the developer to reply to the person who submitted the report. either directly (email address) or proxied via Apple to preserve anonymity.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
