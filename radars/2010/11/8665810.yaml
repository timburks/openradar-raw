    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nI would like to see a 'Wish List' feature added to the App Store application on iOS (for iPhone and iPad), much like the Wish List feature on the desktop.\r\n\r\nThe user should be able to add any application on the store to their wish list (like a favorites list), and browse their wish list, from the device.\r\n\r\nOnce purchased, an application should be removed from the wish list.\r\n\r\nThis would allow users to save up and plan for application purchases, and have a central place to remember which applications they wanted to buy. Without such a feature, one might lose out on forgotten planned purchases, and impulse purchases would be the norm."
