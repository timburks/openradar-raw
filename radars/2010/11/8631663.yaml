    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempt to encode instance of NSValue always raises an exception when that instance contains value of type struct and when coder is instance of NSKeyedArchiver class. The NSValue instance has been created with value:withObjCType: method and has been encoded with encodeObject:forKey: method. The exception is of type NSInvalidArgumentException and is raised due to \"-[NSKeyedArchiver encodeValueOfObjCType:at:]: this archiver cannot encode structs\", but that method was not use implicitly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create variable that is of type struct.\r\n2) Create instance of NSValue class using value:withObjCType: method.\r\n3) Encode this object using encodeObject:forKey: method of NSKeyedArchiver instance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSKeyedArchiver should encode instance of NSValue class that contains struct variable as same as any other object.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSInvalidArgumentException is raised.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on 10.6.4/Mac Pro (1.1) 2x2.66 GHz and on 10.5.8/PowerBook 12\" 1.5 GHz.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCommand line utility crashes and provides the crash log, that is attached. Also file with basic sample code is attached."
