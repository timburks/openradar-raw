    description: Please support the ability for 3rd parties to extend Xcode via a public plugin API.  Aperture, Visual Studio, Eclipse, TextMate and other applications benefit from this ability.  I would like to see more advanced refactorings, code analysis (think Resharper by Jetbrains) and modeling.
