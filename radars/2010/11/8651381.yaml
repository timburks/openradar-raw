    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSome documents opened from Safari via the \"Open In\" document sharing menu use random names for the document file name in the URL. The destination application receives the URL via -application:handleOpenURL: or -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: and has no way of determining what the original file name should be. The randomly generated name (e.g. QL-WYDZ766b.pdf) is meaningless to the user and has no relation to the origin document.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch for a PDF in Safari.\r\ne.g. http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR2010.pdf\r\n\r\nLoad the PDF and then use the \"Open In\" menu to open in a 3rd party application.\r\n(e.g. Files for iPhone: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/files/id285578660?mt=8)\r\n\r\nThe application is passed an application URL with a randomly generated file name (even though the original document name was well specified in the origin URL).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe open in URL passed to the application should use the original file name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA randomly generated file name is used."
