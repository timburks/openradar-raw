    description: "Summary:\r\niMovie doesn't display portrait video properly or export it at full resolution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take 720*1280 video (I used an iPhone 4).\r\n2. Import to iMovie (I went through iPhoto). Project was set to 16:9.\r\n3. Export.\r\n4. Rotate the clip.\r\n5. View thumbnails in Event and Project areas.\r\n6. Export.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. iMovie should export up to 720*1280\r\n5. Video should look normal, as it's now landscape.\r\n6. Resolutions up to 1280*720 should be available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. iMovie exports up to 540 (*960?).\r\n5. Video is distorted -- landscape video is horizontally compressed to show grey side borders. See screenshot.\r\n6. Max resolution is 960*540."
