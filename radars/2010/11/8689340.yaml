    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nFull screen of a <video> element with an aspect ratio different than the source video will stretch to the aspect ratio of the <video> player instead of using pillarbox/letterbox\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Insert a <video> element into an HTML page something like this <video src=\"file.mp4\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"> where file.mp4 has dimensions like 480x360\r\n2. Play the video.\r\n3. Click the fullscreen button in Safari's video player\r\n4. Full screen stretches the video to a 16:9 aspect ratio (matching the 16:9 of the <video> element).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect the video file to keep its 4:3 aspect ratio when going fullscreen and to see black pillars on either side. This would be similar to the <video> when playing in the page, as it maintains the aspect ratio. The HTML spec says:\r\n\r\n> Video content should be rendered inside the element's playback area such that the video content is shown centered in the playback area at the largest possible size that fits completely within it, with the video content's aspect ratio being preserved. Thus, if the aspect ratio of the playback area does not match the aspect ratio of the video, the video will be shown letterboxed or pillarboxed\r\n\r\nThis is how inline video is handled and I would expect fullscreen to behave the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe video is stretched to fit the aspect ratio of the <video> player.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis problem does not exist in iPad's Safari. On the iPad, going fullscreen maintains the source video's aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThere's a good example of this problem here if you access the page without Flash installed: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1104350651/tiktok-lunatik-multi-touch-watch-kits\r\n\r\nThis exhibits the problem slightly differently, as the <video> element is a 4:3 ratio and the source is 16:9. The playing video is stretched vertically when going to fullscreen with black bars on the side, mimicking the 4:3 ratio of its <video> element.\r\n\r\nAttached is a short video of the above site's issue. I originally discovered this working on a video product for our CMS. Here is another example, from our own product: http://materdei.org/apps/video/watch.jsp?v=830"
