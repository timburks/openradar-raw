    description: "Summary: The rotation lock switch now mutes the volume, affecting usability.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Toggle the rotation lock switch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The screen rotation locks/unlocks.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The volume mutes/unmutes.\r\n\r\nRegression: Versions of iOS before 4.2 did not have this issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOn the iPhone, muting is important as the phone can ring at times/places where this is not appropriate. It's important to be able to quickly change the mute status, and to be able to tell without looking that it's muted.\r\n\r\nThe iPad, on the other hand, rarely makes unexpected noise. In the event that it would, and the user does not want this, it is simple enough to hold down the volume button until the volume is zero. Unlike the iPhone, it is rare that one would want to do this \"blind;\" for example, in a pocket, when the value of a tactile mute switch on iPhone is apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iPad does, however, get frequently used at angles that are very near the point at which the OS tips the screen into the other rotation. In practice, I found the physical rotation lock switch welcome, and rarely muted the device.\r\n\r\nWith either function mapped to the physical switch, it's 3 or 4 steps to get to the opposite function: unlock, double-tap home button, swipe to left, tap rotation lock or volume. In practice, I never noticed how often I used the physical rotation lock until it became a series of taps."
