    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen looking up an unknown word in Dictionary.app through the \"Look up in dictionary\" context menu, and pressing on the \"More…\" button in the palette, Dictionary.app opens, but most of the times no menu bar is displayed, and in any case no interaction with the app is possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Look up a work not in any of the installed dictionaries, \r\n    such as zalupizetosis by control-clicking on the word, \r\n    and choosing Look up in dictionary.\r\n2) After the dictionary panel opens, showing that\r\n   no entry was found, clic on the More… button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDictionary.app would open-up, with the selected word in the search field, no results would appear, and interaction with the application would be possible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDictionary.app opens up, showing no activity, no word to look up, and no interaction is possible with it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nTested in 10.6.5 (build 10H574); not remembered as happening before.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nChanging Dictionary.app preferences to open Dictionary.app instead of showing the panel when selecting \"Look up in Dictionary\" produces the same results.\r\n\r\nChanging Dictionary.app preferences to deactivate searching Wikipedia entries seems to avoid the problem."
