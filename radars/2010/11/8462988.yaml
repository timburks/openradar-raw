    description: "Under iOS 4.0.x the following link opened Maps.app, centered the map around the coordinate, initiated a business search around that coordinate and set the map span according to the found businesses:\r\n\r\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=restaurant&ll=48,11\r\n\r\nUnder iOS 4.1 (and 4.2 beta 1) this link only centers the map at the coordinate but does not initiate a business search. This breaks the functionality of a legacy version (1.x) of our app \"Where To?\". That legacy version is not available on the App Store anymore and thus can't be updated anymore.\r\n\r\nObviously, customers don't understand that the functionality broke when updating from iOS 4.0 to 4.1.\r\n\r\nWe're aware of the sll parameter, so using this link\r\n\r\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=restaurant&ll=48,11&sll=48,11&spn=0.1,0.1\r\n\r\nwe can reproduce a similar behavior. However, we've to specify the spn parameter, otherwise the map is shown at the closest zoom level.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the old behavior would be maintained. \r\n\r\nThis would also be in line with the documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/prerelease/#featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Articles/MapLinks.html\r\n\r\nThe documentation does not state that the sll parameter is required to initiate a search. The maps URL scheme would be more fault tolerant, if it'd accept the above form with just the q and the ll parameter."
