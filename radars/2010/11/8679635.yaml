    description: "Summary: With the terminal command \"smbd --version\" you'll see that SMB has the version 3.0.28a-apple. But there is a newer version of Samba v3.5 available who also supports Windows 7 clients.\r\n\r\nThis could fix this problem described in the Apple Knowledge Base:\r\n\r\nMac OS X Server: Cannot join Windows 7 to a Mac OS X PDC Domain\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS3235\r\n\r\nThe problem is really that Apple is using an old version of Samba. \r\n\r\nSo I hope that you will update Samba to a newer version because when I sometime read in the Apple discussion boards or talking to people there are sometimes problems between Mac OS X and Windows.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
