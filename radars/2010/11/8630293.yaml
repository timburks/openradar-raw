    description: "Summary:\r\nCGContextDrawPDFPage() is broken on iOS. More specifically the outermost edge of the PDF is always rendered white even if images in the PDF are aligned with the border.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Open up the ZoomingPDFViewer apple sample code example.\r\n2.) replace TestPage.pdf with a PDF that has non-white images on the border of the page (see upload).\r\n3.) open the TestPage.pdf with Preview.app and see that the images are exactly at the border, there is no white band between the images and the edge of the PDF window even when zooming to the border.\r\n4.) Run the sample and zoom into the border with images. there is a white band around the images.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe PDF in zoomingPDFViewer renders just as on the desktop, i.e. no white band between images and the border of the PDF \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsmall white border on iOS\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nusing kCGPDFCropBox/kCGPDFTrimBox doesn't fix the bug either\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ni've uploaded a sample PDF that exhibits the problem, a picture is aligned with the right border of the pdf."
