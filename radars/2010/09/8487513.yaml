    description: "Please add a \"Current iOS\" setting that's analogous to the \"Current Mac OS\" setting for the Base SDK in Project > Edit Project Settings > General.\r\n\r\nEach time a new iOS SDK is released, the project settings need to be updated and checked into a source code repository. Besides the hassle, it's also a likely source of conflict since team members don't always update to the latest SDK at the same time. The thing that matters most from a project point-of-view is the deployment target (that's what we test against and it doesn't change very frequently.)\r\n\r\nWe've had to deal with the SDK setting update with iOS 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0, 4.1 and now 4.2. For multiple products (project files.) It's getting a bit old.\r\n\r\nThe \"Current Mac OS\" setting can be used to achieve the end result, but you lose the choice to switch between the Device and Simulator. Also, the name of the label in the popup menu is far from obvious to iOS developers who may have never developed for Mac OS. (Yes, I know you can hold down the option key to switch between device and simulator SDKs, but how many people know this?)"
