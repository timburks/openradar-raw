    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is not uncommon to be working on a large project with a myriad of targets.  For example, a target to compile the main application, with targets to compile support plugins, or targets to compile various subsets of unit tests, or targets to compile privileged helper tools, or targets to build disk images, or generate documentation or coverage reports, etc.\r\n\r\nWith the potential for the number of targets to balloon quickly, it would be wonderful if Xcode had the ability to \"group\" targets, just like you can group source code files.\r\n\r\nThat way you could create a Target Group called \"Primary Application\", and put in there the targets for your app+privileged helper tools, or a Target Group called \"Profiling\" and have your Unit Tests and GCOV targets in there.  Or another Target Group or \"Release Packaging\" that does all of the automated localization scripts and then packages everything up in to a DMG.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect multiple targets in Xcode.  Attempt to select the \"Group\" menu item from the Project menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to select the \"Group\" item to group the targets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Group\" menuitem is disabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis functionality has been missing for at least since Xcode 3 (I don't have older builds available to verify for < 3)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor bonus points, make it so that a target can depend on a Target Group (ie, everything within that target) for compilation."
