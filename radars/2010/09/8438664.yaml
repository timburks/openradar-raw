    description: "Summary:\r\nBetween iOS 3.1.3 and 4.1, a change to networking has resulted in an order of magnitude decrease in performance (and many timeouts) when downloading a large file with searchForServices running.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build & run attached project on iOS 4.1.\r\n2. Point it at a 10MB file on your LAN.\r\n3. Tap Download and wait, write down speed.\r\n4. Turn on searchForServices.\r\n5. Tap Download and wait. Watch the speed; the transfer will probably die, and the speed will disappear from the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpeed difference should be negligible, like it is on iOS 3.1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsearchForServices ON results in a 10x or worse performance hit, and causes many downloads to time out.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI haven't been able to isolate whether this bug first appears in 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2 or 4.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached project will also run on an iOS 3.1 device; you can verify there that the results match Expected Results rather than Actual Results."
