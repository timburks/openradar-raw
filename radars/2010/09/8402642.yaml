    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhilst Push Notifications can be customised per application, however push notifications can be intrusive during the hours a user may wish to sleep - even alerts lighting up the screen can interrupt sleep. Some applications offer a customisable Quiet Time (Boxcar for Twitter notifications etc)during which the application only receives Badged updates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTurn your phone on, and await a Game Center alert from someone in a different timezone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWith Quiet Time enabled, the user would simply see the application's badge incremented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIn Game Center's case, a loud trumpet fanfare wakes you from your slumber to let you know that someone you don't know wants to be your friend."
