    description: "Summary: A user with an account username that is exactly the same as another user's display name (ignoring case) is prevented from logging into a Mac OS X computer bound to Active Directory for authentication.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a user in AD with username 'bob' and display name \"Smith, Bob\" and assign any valid password.\r\n2. Create a second user in AD with username 'alice' and display name \"Bob\" and assign any valid password.\r\n3. Bind a Mac OS X computer to that active directory. Do not enable mobile accounts, and leave all other options at their defaults (advanced options have shown to be inconsequential in my testing, but this reflects my current setup).\r\n4. In System Preferences->Accounts->Login Options, set \"Display login window as:\" to \"Name and password\".\r\n5. Reboot or log out the current user to return to the login window.\r\n6. Have the first user log in with username 'bob' and his assigned password.\r\n7. A list of users will be presented, \"Smith, Bob\" and \"Bob\". Click \"Smith, Bob\" as the user is able to recognize his given and family name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The user is granted access, having provided a valid account identifier and password.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The login window shakes and the user is denied access. They then escalate to their dean who calls your VP. This is a Bad Thing.\r\n\r\nRegression: Changing either the username 'bob' or the display name \"Bob\" so that they are no longer the same (ignoring case), works around the issue.\r\n\r\nNotes: Sadly, the workaround above is not an option with the [...] central active directory. User 'bob' may really like his username. It's a cool name. The department that uses the account 'alice' with display name \"Bob\" may have a legitimate business reason why it is set that way. It is a long, painful, and largely unsuccessful political process to make such a change to student or faculty records like that. It is simply outside of our control. Furthermore, the computer labs utilize wired 802.1x network authentication and the RADIUS server doesn't recognize \"DOMAIN\\user\" or \"user@domain\" as being equivalent to \"user\" so I cannot even suggest that as a workaround. Yes, the RADIUS server is also outside of our control.\r\n\r\nIt would be preferable if Directory Services on the client simply only queried against the account shortname instead of also against the display name (perhaps optionally). Honestly, even for small directories, how often is that feature used? And given the potential for conflict in large directories (as in millions upon millions of records), is it really worth it?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is a bug that is preventing that user list from working (step 7, above), fixing that would also be sufficient even if it meant on occasion that a user had to make a few extra clicks to log in.\r\n\r\nIn short: This is causing real problems for real students and faculty at our university and it is a hurdle to OS X desktop adoption in our institution."
