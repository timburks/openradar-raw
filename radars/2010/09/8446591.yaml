    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple Bug Reporter and associated groups inside Apple seem to be trying their hardest to discourage engineers from filing bugs. The most obvious way this is expressed is in the absolute insistence that any bug filed against developer tools or one of the associated SDKs come with a sample project attached, no matter how trivial the bug or how clear the reproduction steps. This has been taken so far as to ask for sample projects for bugs where it simply makes no sense, such as a behavioral issue in Xcode that isn't related to any given project. In one instance I was forced to create a new project from an Xcode template, package that up with zero changes, and attach that because the Apple engineer responsible was unwilling to perform that step himself. The end result of all this is a system that makes the barrier to entry extremely high for a large category of bugs, and that coupled with the high incidence of duplicate bugs and a complete lack of transparency in the process gives the impression that it has been designed to discourage bugs from being filed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to http://radar.apple.com in Safari\r\n2. Log in with your ADC credentials\r\n3. Click on New Problem\r\n4. Select iPhone SDK from the Product dropdown\r\n5. Select Serious Bug from the Classification dropdown\r\n6. Select Always from the Reproducible dropdown\r\n7. Fill in the other text fields with a detailed description of a bug that affects the shipping/upcoming iOS SDK, along with detailed reproduction steps.\r\n8. Submit the bug\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple engineers should follow the reproduction steps, verify that the bug exists, and then process it as normal. If this bug is a duplicate, such duplicate-checking should occur either before the reproduction steps are attempted, or after the engineer is unable to reproduce the bug but before the filer is asked to provide more information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEvery single bug filed in this way gets returned asking for a sample project, no matter how trivial or obvious the bug is, or how much work it may take to create such a sample. And in most cases, after providing a sample, the bug is marked as a duplicate anyway.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis behavior has gotten worse over time. A few years back it was possible to file SDK bugs without sample projects that were accepted without comment. Unfortunately, this problem seems to be much worse for iOS SDK issues, to the point where it simply doesn't feel worth the time anymore to file bugs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo matter how detailed my bug report or reproduction steps are, if I don't attach a sample project, the bug is returned to me. And if I don't respond in a timely fashion, it is closed, regardless of how valid it is, or whether it duplicates an existing bug (there is no indication that the bug was even checked for duplicates). It gives the feeling that WWDR is holding my bug report hostage until I cough up a sample project. This is not a good incentive to file bugs. I recognize that Apple engineering time is limited, but so is mine. I have had valid, important bugs closed for lack of a sample project because I did not have time to create one. I even demonstrated a bug in person to an Apple engineer at WWDC, then had the subsequent report closed for lack of a sample project. At this point, the list of bugs that I would like to file is as long as my arm. However, it would take a rather significant amount of time to create the sample projects necessary, time I simply do not have. As a result, I don't feel it's even worth the time to write up the bug, because I know it will end up closed no matter how valid a bug it is."
