    description: "06-Sep-2010 11:48 PM Hoon 황보:\r\n'apptest1.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n06-Sep-2010 11:48 PM Hoon 황보:\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode can target both of iOS/Mac OS X in a single project, but there is a bug blocks this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Refer attachment.)\r\n1. Make a new Mac OS X application project.\r\n2. Add a new iOS application target.\r\n3. Add some source files to make iOS target to work.\r\n4. Build and run Mac OS X target. It runs well.\r\n5. Switch to iOS target, and choose simulator.\r\n6. Build and run iOS target. It runs well too.\r\n7. Switch back to Mac OS X target.\r\n8. It does not work anymore.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMac OS X target should be built and run.\r\nI saw a \"iPhone Simulator\" string appears when I switched to iOS target/simulator, and it does not disappear when I switched back to Mac OS X target.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMac OS X target does not being built.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDon't know.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI found a workaround:\r\n- Close your Xcode.\r\n- If you see inside of .xcodeproj folder, you can see several files.\r\n- And you can find a .pbxuser file.\r\n- Open it with text editor, and find a line \"activeSDKPreference=...\" (... is something like iphonesimulator4.0)\r\n- If there it is, erase the line, and save the file.\r\n- Re-open the project with Xcode.\r\n- Oops! it's reset!\r\n- You can compile Mac OS X target again!\r\n\r\nI believe this problem can be fixed easily.\r\nI attached a project file that I used to let you reproduce this problem and workaround easily.\r\n\r\nThere should be many cases needs partially sharing source codes over platforms.\r\nFor instance, if you are making a game for iOS, it's pretty hard to monitoring it's internal states, so this makes whole development less efficient. If you make a separate Mac OS X program which monitors internal game state, it should be great help. Of course, the program should same state and logic code.\r\n\r\nI cannot figure out, more cases, however, I believe there is no reason to block this feature. Please consider patching this to enable the feature."
