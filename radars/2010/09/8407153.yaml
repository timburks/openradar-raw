    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things about a social gaming network, is the ability to not only see what games your friends are playing but also what achievements they have gotten so you can compete against them. It seems Game Center is lacking this ability, as there is no way to see what achievements a friend has unlocked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Game Center app\r\n2. Select the Friend's Tab\r\n3. Select a friend with Achievements\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect to be able to see what achievements the user has gotten, say by clicking the blue \"Achievements\" label.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no current way that I can see to see the achievements of a certain user.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is new, so no regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
