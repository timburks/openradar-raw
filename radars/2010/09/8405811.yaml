    description: "08-Sep-2010 11:26 AM Matt Martel:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUsing the sample code from Apple, cannot reliably detect whether Game Center is available on iPhone 3G.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe sample code checks for GKLocalPlayer class and OS 4.1. Both of these are available in the shipping version of iOS 4.1 for iPhone 3G. This leads to erroneous code which thinks Game Center is supported on iPhone 3G.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNeed a way to reliably detect Game Center support.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nGame Center appears to be available on iPhone 3G with iOS 4.1. If you have code/UI that needs to distinguish, you must resort to device detection, which is frowned upon by Apple.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWould be better if Game Center was supported on iPhone 3G. Many unhappy customers out there."
