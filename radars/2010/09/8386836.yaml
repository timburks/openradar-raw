    description: "Summary: Users should be able to \"like\" songs and albums from within a context menu in their local iTunes library, provided those albums/songs are available in the store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the user has Genius turned on, this should be available. Genius provides a database to iTunes, so if the album/song is available to purchase in the iTMS, the user should have the option to \"like\" it from within the local library. If the song isn't available, the option could be greyed out (alternatively, a dialog could display, but this feels clunkier)"
