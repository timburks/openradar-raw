    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niTunes 10 changed all the previously color icons in the sidebar (Music, Movies, iTunes Store, etc) to gray, dull icons. This severely hampers usability because each icon stood out. One didn't have to concentrate on exactly what the icon looked like, or read the name to closely. Now one has to look, read, and concentrate on what they are clicking on, because all the icons look the same at first glance.  Bringing back color icon would change this and make it much, much easier to find the right icon. The differentiation of color helps the eye go to the right place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Look at icons.\r\n2. Try to quickly find TV Shows from Movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA color icon would draw the eye to the right selection.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nEyes hurt trying to figure out what is what since there is no color, and no differentiation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
