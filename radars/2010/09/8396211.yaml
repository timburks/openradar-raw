    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice if Mail would automatically detect special IMAP folders — sent, drafts, trash and junk — when you create a new IMAP account.\r\n\r\nThat way, users would not have to select each mailbox and choose Mailbox > Use this Mailbox for like they currently do.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this could work for all servers. At a minimum, it could work for major ISPs/vendors like Gmail."
