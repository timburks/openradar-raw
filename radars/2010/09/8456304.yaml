    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen the iPad held in landscape mode with the home button on the right-hand side of the device (and the volume rocker on the top of the device), the volume rocker adjusts the volume inversely of what is expected.  The same is true when the iPad is held in portrait mode with the home button on the top of the device and the volume rocker on the left of the device.\r\n\r\nPressing the volume rocker to the right makes the volume slider on the on-screen HUD move left and lower the volume.  Inversely, moving the volume rocker to the left moves the volume slider on the on-screen HUD to the right and increase the volume.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n====== Landscape with home button on right ======\r\n1) Rotate the iPad into landscape mode with the home button on the right and the volume rocker on the top.\r\n2) Press the volume rocker to the left a few clicks.\r\n3) Press the volume rocker to the right a few clicks.\r\n\r\n====== Portrait with home button on top ======\r\n1) Rotate the iPad into portrait mode with the home button on the top and the volume rocker on the left side.\r\n2) Press the volume rocker to the up a few clicks.\r\n3) Press the volume rocker to the down a few clicks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n====== Landscape with home button on right ======\r\nPressing the volume rocker to the LEFT should DECREASE the volume and reflect this in the on-screen HUD and media player control HUD. \r\nPressing the volume rocker to the RIGHT should INCREASE the volume and reflect this on the on-screen HUD.\r\n\r\n====== Portrait with home button on top ======\r\nPressing the volume rocker in the DOWN direction should DECREASE the volume and reflect this in the on-screen HUD and media player control HUD.\r\nPressing the volume rocker in the UP direction should INCREASE the volume and reflect this on the on-screen HUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n====== Landscape with home button on right ======\r\nPressing the volume rocker to the LEFT actually INCREASES the volume and moves the HUD display to the RIGHT.\r\nPressing the volume rocker to the RIGHT actually DECREASES the volume and moves the HUD display to the LEFT.\r\n\r\n====== Portrait with home button on top ======\r\nPressing the volume rocker in the DOWN direction actually INCREASES the volume and moves the HUD display to the RIGHT.\r\nPressing the volume rocker in the UP direction actually DECREASES the volume and moves the HUD display to the LEFT.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis bug is very hard to get used to because it is the exact opposite of the expected behavior.  Intuitively, the user would expect the volume rocker to be re-mapped for every orientation when the device is rotated.  Currently, it is not for landscape mode with the home button on the right or for portrait mode with the home button on the top."
