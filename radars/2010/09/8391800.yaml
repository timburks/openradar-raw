    description: iTunes 10 changed the window buttons (Close, Minimize, Zoom) from horizontal to vertical. This is inconsistent with the rest of Mac OS X, as since 10.0 all window buttons have been horizontal. Muscle memory for users trying to close windows is out the door for iTunes 10, as the buttons are in different places. No application should have buttons that are in different places from standard Mac OS X windows, as this is very confusing.
