    description: "28-Sep-2010 11:02 PM Adrian Nier:\r\nSummary:\r\nDisk Utility is too lax when verifying the SMART data of a drive. It should report a drive as failing the moment a bad sector is found.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an HDD containing bad sectors to the internal S/ATA bus of any Mac.\r\n2. Launch Disk Utility, select the faulty HDD in the list on the left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe S.M.A.R.T. Status should reflect the fact that the HDD is failing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe S.M.A.R.T. Status is displayed as verified.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshot.\r\nPeople outside of Apple can see the screenshot here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/adriannier/5034447480"
