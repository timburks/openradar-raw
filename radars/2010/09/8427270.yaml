    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting an alarm in the clock app results in the alarm firing and hour earlier than expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe night before, set an alarm to go off weekdays at 8:00 AM.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alarm should go off at 8:00 AM the next morning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alarm actually fires at 7:00 AM the next and every weekday morning.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSetting the alarm to a time less than an hour away produces the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshots. I'll try different scenarios to see if this is affected by some other factor (sleeping for an extended time, time zone setting, etc.) and will update this bug when I find new information.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nI've found that this occurs with any repeating alarm (single or multiple days) and only if you choose Indianapolis as the time zone city.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I found another bug that is probably related to this. If you have your time zone city initially set to Indianapolis, then try change it to Atlanta, it is actually set to \"Washington, D.C.\" even though you tapped \"Atlanta, U.S.A.\"\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved with iOS 4.2 (8C5101c) and can be closed."
