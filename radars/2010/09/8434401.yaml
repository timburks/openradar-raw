    description: "Summary:\r\nA device running iOS 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2 or 4.1 will occasionally display an authentication dialog for a CalDAV server, although the service is configured using a profile, that contains the correct password. Dismissing the dialog by pressing the Cancel button, results in the user having to restart their device to regain calendar synchronization.\r\n\r\nThe CalDAV service is hosted on an up-to-date Mac OS X Server 10.6 system, devices running iPhone OS 3.1.3 are also configured using profiles and never exhibit the problem.\r\n\r\n15-Sep-2010 11:38 PM Adrian Nier:\r\nThe problem has just been observed on an iPhone 3G running iPhone OS 3.1.3. The console’s content around the time the authentication dialog appeared is attached as file iphone_313_caldav_problem_log.txt.\r\n\r\n16-Sep-2010 02:05 AM Adrian Nier:\r\nI’m attaching logs from an iPad running iOS 4.2b and an iPhone running iOS 4.1, that displayed the authentication dialog today. You’ll also find the CalDAV service’s debug log in the attachments.\r\n\r\n24-May-2011 10:31 AM Adrian Nier:\r\nThe issue is not resolved with iOS 4.3.3. Also see here:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/15262461#15262461\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/15264339#15264339\r\n\r\n04-Jul-2011 11:22 PM Adrian Nier:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved with the update to Mac OS X 10.6.8 and can be closed."
