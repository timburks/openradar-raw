    description: "Summary: iTunes lists music in Song|Album|Artist organization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Search for music in the store. Gasp in horror.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Should be Song|Artist|Album\r\n\r\nActual Results: Isn't.\r\n\r\nRegression: Happens everywhere.\r\n\r\nNotes: The default iTunes library sort is Song|Artist|Album, so the store should be the same. It's how music has been traditionally organized. It doesn't make sense for the iTMS to be different. \"City Middle\" is not by Alligator."
