    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen in Assistant mode in Xcode 4, and using it in \"Manual\" mode, unlike the main editor on the left hand side of the window, the assistant editor on the right hand side does not support file history (e.g. back/forward buttons). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode workspace and choose the assistant editor mode.\r\n2. Select \"Manual\" from the leftmost segment of the jump bar at the top of the assistant editor\r\n3. Select a file to be displayed in the assistant editor (file A)\r\n4. Use the jump bar to select a second file in the assistant editor (file B)\r\n5. Press command-control-left arrow\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe assistant editor should change from showing file B back to showing file A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA system beep is played, because the menu item is not supported\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nA history feature may not make sense in the various other modes of the assistant editor (e.g. Counterparts, Includes, etc.), but not being able to navigate back to the previous file you were just looking at makes it very difficult to use the assistant in Manual mode. Ideally, when in Manual mode, I'd like the sides of the editor to essentially act identically (but independently), like the split view in Xcode 3 does.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
