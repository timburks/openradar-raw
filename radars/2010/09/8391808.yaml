    description: Not everybody wants to use their real name when using social networking sites. Many people like to remain semi-anonymous. Having Ping require a real name, when Twitter, and even Facebook do not require sharing a name, makes Ping hard to use. Since this applies to reviews, not everybody wants to have their name show up in a review. Usernames make users feel more comfortable about sharing their personal tastes and opinions. Usernames should be allowed.
