    description: "Summary: Differing-but-still-valid return types used in a block literal with -[NSMutableArray sortUsingComparator:] can cause it to provide the wrong results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n- Download attached project, SortItOut.zip, unzip it, build it, run it and look at results on Console.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are four sets of results. All use a block literal to provide the sorting mechanism. All should provide a correctly-sorted array.\r\n\r\n#1 Uses -[NSMutableArray sortUsingComparator:] with a block literal that returns the constants NSOrderedAscending, NSOrderedDescending, and NSOrderedSame directly. Note these are not the same type as the NSComparisonResult expected of an NSComparator block, but instead are a technically unrelated enumeration. I don't know if that's significant, but it's the only difference I can see.\r\n#2 Uses -[NSMutableArray sortUsingComparator:] with a block literal that uses a local variable of type NSComparisonResult for its return value. Otherwise, it is identical in logic to #1.\r\n#3 Uses a custom sorting method (implemented as bubble sort to save time) with a block literal that returns the constants NSOrderedAscending et al directly.\r\n#4 Uses the custom sorting method as #3 with a block literal that uses a local variable of type NSComparisonResult for its return value.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n#1 returns an incorrectly sorted array. Instead of the correct sorting, the order of the array's elements is merely reversed. #2-#4 all return correctly-sorted arrays.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs far as I know, this is not a regression.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to never return NSOrderedAscending et al directly, but always to use a NSComparisonResult variable to hold the result, and return that."
