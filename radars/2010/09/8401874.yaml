    description: "Summary: An input field with the autofocus attribute set does not get a focus ring when the page is first loaded or reloaded. When this is the case, the focus ring does not reappear when focus is moved. The problem does not occur when there is no stylesheet link element in the page header. When the problem occurs, the :hover and :active state CSS pseudo selectors also don't work. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Go to http://stuff.vandervossen.net/temporary/autofocus_broken.html and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The focus ring should be shown and the :hover and :active state CSS pseudo selectors should work as expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The focus ring is not shown and the :hover and :active state CSS pseudo selectors do not work as expected.\r\n\r\nNotes: Also tested in Webkit Nightly r66819."
