    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a modal view is dismissed while the keyboard is visible and the device is in landscape orientation, the modal view jumps to the left before the animation begins.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPresent a modal view with presentation style UIModalPresentationFormSheet. Let a subview of the modal view be the first responder, so that the keyboard is visible. Let the view be rotated to landscape orientation. Dismiss the modal view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe modal view slides, fades, etc., according to the animation style.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe modal view first jumps to the left.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by sending resignFirstResponder to the firstResponder before dismissing the modal view."
