    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connecting a WiFi iPad to the Internet via a http Proxy, network apps, except for Safari, still cannot connect to the Internet.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Settings > Wi-Fi, connect to a Wi-Fi network where a working HTTP Proxy is connected to the Internet\r\n2. Switch to Safari, and verify that the proxy is working by browsing the web. \r\n3. Switch to any other network iPad app, such a Mail or third-party iPad apps like USA Today, NY Times, BBC News, Dropbox, or Flipboard. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected those non-Safari apps to function as well as Safari when connecting to the Internet, without further configuration. I expected the iOS to use the Proxy transparently to support network connectivity for the other apps.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll apps that need a network, other than Safari, complain that they cannot connect to the Internet even though the proxy is functioning.  \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAttempted on a Wi-Fi iPad 64GB running iOS 3.2.2 7B500 connected to a proxy server whose address is set via Settings  > Wi-Fi > The Network > HTTP Proxy > Auto > URL, then only Safari becomes fully functional.  This proxy also serves a MacBook Pro without issue."
