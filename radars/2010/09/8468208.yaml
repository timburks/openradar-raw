    description: "Summary:\r\nCopying an attachment from a draft email using text selection, does not copy the attachment itself but only an empty placeholder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a draft email with an attachment. For example send a PDF from Pages. Don't actually send it but save it as a draft email. Then mark the attachment using text selection tools. Paste into a new mail and send it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe mail should contain the attachment.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mail only contains an empty placeholder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe issue is reproducible in both iOS 3.2.2 and 4.2 beta 1."
