    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a 500 GB Time Capsule. I have a 500 GB hard drive with 125 GB of free space (375 GB used).\r\n\r\nbackupd is stuck in loop trying to free space unnecessarily.  For a few days, it has been doing this\r\nwhile ( 1 ) {\r\n  mountTimeCapsule()\r\n  calculateFreeSpaceNeeded()\r\n  deleteOldestBackupSet()\r\n  attemptBackup()\r\n  error(\"Not enough disk space\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nEach iteration takes an hour or so.  /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backups/Backups.backupdb/Paul’s\\ MBP has gone from 48 items to 12 items.\r\n\r\nAttached are system log excerpts containing \"backupd\" and system profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Back up your hard drive with Time Capsule. Make many backups — usually daily — over 6 months, ending on July 2. Time Capsule backs up and prunes as normal\r\n\r\n2. Have hard drive fail on August 17, not having backed up for six weeks.\r\n\r\n3. Run Disk Warrior on your disk. Recover many contents to external HD.\r\n\r\n4. Install new HD.\r\n\r\n5. Install SnowLeopard on new HD.\r\n\r\n6. Copy files (drag via Finder) from rescue HD in step (3). \r\n\r\n7. Copy remaining files (drag via Finder) from Time Capsule.\r\n\r\n8. Attempt to backup to Time Capsule.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime Capsule backs up two months worth of changed files.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTime Capsule spends 4 days erasing one backup set at at time, eventually backing up the entire HD from scratch.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHa! Not trying this again."
