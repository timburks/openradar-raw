    description: "Summary:\r\nPutting the computer to sleep destroys any RAM disks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a RAM disk using the disk images system, either by running hdiutil directly, or by using my “Make RAM Disk” utility: http://boredzo.org/make-ram-disk\r\n2. Put the computer to sleep.\r\n3. Wake it up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe RAM disk remains in place.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe RAM disk disappears.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nMaybe, but not a recent one—it's done this for a long time.\r\n\r\nMac OS's RAM disk didn't have this problem, but it wasn't powered by the disk images system.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have also occasionally seen this bug with other disk images (those backed by files) and when plugging or unplugging network cables (suggesting that this is caused not by sleep specifically but by network-interface changes), but not consistently. The most consistent way to reproduce this is with a RAM disk and by putting the computer to sleep.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this consistently on my desktop Mac, but not on my laptop. I'm attaching the System Profile for the desktop Mac."
