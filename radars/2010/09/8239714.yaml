    description: "27-Jul-2010 09:32 AM Chris Drackett:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt's possible to set a apple-touch-startup-image for the original iphone (320x460) and the ipad (768x1004) at their native resolution. However, setting such an image for the iphone 4 has no effect. I've tried at the resolution of 640x920, but no image is shown. It seems the only res that works is the old iPhone res (320x460) \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add a apple-touch-startup-image with a size of 320x46 to a webpage.\r\n\r\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-startup-image\" href=\"iphone4.png\">\r\n\r\n2. Add page to home screen\r\n\r\n3. Load app from homescreen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nHigh resolution image will be shown while the app loads.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe default (last state of the app) is shown on load."
