    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nAlthough AppleScript Studio is deprecated, the standard OSAScriptView editing capabilities that Xcode 3.2 provides are still needed because of AppleScript ObjC (ASOC). \r\nYou can actually edit .applescript files and the syntax is recognized but they are treated as normal source files instead of using the AppleScript Editor based, system-wide syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\nOpen Xcode 4. \r\nMake a new Cocoa-AppleScript project.\r\nOpen *.applescript file from Classes group.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nContents be presented with syntax highlighting based on global AppleScript Editor settings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nContents presented in syntax highlighting used for Objective-C source code and based on the xccolorscheme as set in Xcode's preferences. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nFirst appears in Xcode 4 Preview 1.\r\nStill in Preview 2.\r\nStill in Preview 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf integrating the OSAScriptView as display for .applescript files is not possible then please give us the ability to define a seperate color scheme so that we can customize it to look like the AppleScript Editor. Thank you."
