    description: "Summary:  NSArray sends retain messages to its objects.  If an object doesn't implement -retain, however, it crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached file with garbage collection turned off.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe program runs successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe program crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nImplementing +initialize, -retain, and -release fixes the crash.  Also, enabling garbage collection fixes it, presumably by eating retain and release messages in objc_msgsend().\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI ran into this issue when trying to create an NSArray of the runtime's root classes.  Some of them don't implement -retain.  Presumably this is also true of the other collection classes, but I've only tested NSArray."
