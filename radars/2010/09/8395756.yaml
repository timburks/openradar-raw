    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen playing back a video in a separate window with iTunes at any size less than the actual video size results in the video becoming slightly 'pixelated'.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set \"Play Movies and TV Shows\" in iTunes preferences to \"in a separate window\"\r\n2. Start playing a video file in iTunes 10\r\n3. Set the video size to actual size\r\n- Notice no degradation in quality when moving the mouse over/off the video allowing the playback controls to appear/disappear\r\n4. Decrease the video size to less than actual size\r\n- Notice that the video will become slightly pixelated when the playback controls are not displayed, however as soon as the playback controls start to appear the video is properly resized 'smoothly'\r\n\r\nScreen recording showing issue: [Shortened version of video so as to not include anything that might be under NDA: http://s.jasonrm.net/8vlrf2 ]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpecting same results as playback in Quicktime X produces, where the video quality remains constant, no matter if the playback control UI is being overlaid on the video or not on a video window that has been resized to less than actual size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo quality is reduced noticeably when the video window is resized to any size less than actual size.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnable to test previous iTunes versions, however I don't recall ever seeing this occur.\r\nTested on Mac Pro 1,1 and MacBook Pro 5,1 running Mac OS X 10.6.4 (10F569).\r\nThere does not appear to be any quality degradation with resizing the video to any size greater than or equal to the actual size.\r\nThere does not appear to be any quality degradation when \"Play Movies and TV Shows\" in iTunes preferences to \"in the iTunes window\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTest videos include ones from WWDC 2010 and a few TV Show episodes from the iTunes store."
