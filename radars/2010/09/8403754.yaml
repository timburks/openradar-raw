    description: "07-Sep-2010 08:56 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen a YouTube URL is loaded in a UIWebView on an iPad and the user taps the \"play\" button, only audio plays. The same code works normally when running on an iPhone. I have observed this in an iPhone-only (i.e. non-universal) app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a UIWebView and load a YouTube URL (example: \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQm-6AHjH0&feature=youtube_gdata\"). When the page loads in the web view, tap the \"play\" button at the center of the thumbnail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe video would play normally in the UIWebView.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNormal on iPhone, broken on iPad.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSame behavior on iOS 3.2.1, not tested on 3.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn this test the iPhone is running iOS 4.0.1.\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached.\r\n\r\n08-Sep-2010 04:56 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nVerified that the test case works correctly on iPhone OS 3.1. iOS 4.0 was previously verified as working normally; problems occur only on iOS 3.2.x."
