    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iTunes 4.5, the hidden preference invertStoreLinks has toggled whether clicking an arrow link next to a song title, artist or album will default to locating that song, artist or album in iTunes Store, or in your local iTunes Library (using Column Browser). Option (⌥)-clicking the arrows will temporarily toggle the behavior; invertStoreLinks will swap the default.\r\n\r\nIn iTunes 10.0.1, the arrow links have been replaced by a single Ping↓ menu. The ⌥ functionality is still there, and swapping the two using invertStoreLinks still works, too. However, the new menu contains an item label \"Show in iTunes Store\" (and \"Show in iTunes Library\", respectively), which isn't toggled. iTunes will do what it should, but the item label suggests that the invertStoreLinks preference no longer has an effect, even though it does.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Quit iTunes.\r\n2. Run `defaults write com.apple.iTunes invertStoreLinks -bool YES` in Terminal to invert the behavior.\r\n3. Relaunch iTunes.\r\n4. Click on a Ping↓ button to open the new menu. Notice the \"Show in iTunes _Store_\" label.\r\n5. ⌥-click on a Ping↓ button to open the new menu. Notice the \"Show in iTunes _Library_\" label.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWith the invertStoreLinks preference active, the two labels should be swapped: when clicking, it should be \"Show in iTunes Library\"; only when ⌥-clicking should it be \"Show in iTunes Store\". Clicking any of the items underneath should match what the label above suggests will happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label matches the default behavior (i.e., the with invertStoreLinks) disabled, rather than the behavior that will actually occur.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not an issue in iTunes 4.5 through 10.0, which featured arrow links instead of a menu. They had no menu item label, and therefore never had to actually describe what they did."
