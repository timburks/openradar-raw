    description: "iTunes 10 constantly stutters while playing 320kbps mp3's and 256kbps m4a's. Even when the only apps that are running are iTunes and Safari. If i do anything (enter a different url, load a complicated website, go to youtube, etc..) in Safari i get beachball after beachball and iTunes stutters during playback. What I mean by stuttering is that audio will stop for up to a second and then resume from where it was before the stutter. I have tested and if the audio is encoded down to 192kbps the stuttering does not occur. Also the machine seems much snappier all around when its only playing back 192kbps audio. This should not be happening on a modern machine. I could see if i was using a G4 or G5 with leopard and a bunch of other crap, but not on a machine i bought in january 2010. Its also really bad when using Mail.app\r\n\r\nHere are the specs of my machine:\r\n2010 Macbook Pro (2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3 RAM)\r\nOS X 10.6.4\r\niTunes 10.0\r\nSafari 5.2 (iTunes stutters especially bad when trying to load anything having to do with flash [SURPRISE!] lol.)\r\nMail (setup for IMAP... with a large inbox)"
