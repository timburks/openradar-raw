    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOn an iPhone 4 that supports HDR and flash photography, if the user quits the Camera app (i.e. hits the Home button) while HDR mode is on, upon relaunching the app and switching HDR mode off again, the LED flash will be set to \"Auto\", regardless of what the user had chosen prior to turning on HDR in the first place (before quitting the app).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch the built-in Camera app on an iPhone 4.\r\n2. Make sure the LED flash is set to \"On\" or \"Off\" (but not \"Auto\"), and that the HDR feature is turned off.\r\n3. Turn HDR on. The flash will automatically switch to \"Off\".\r\n4. Quit and relaunch the app.\r\n5. Turn HDR off again. The flash settings will be set to \"Auto\", instead of going back to what the user had specifically chosen prior to turning on the HDR feature.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter relaunching the app and turning HDR off (in step 5 above), the flash settings should revert to whatever the user had chosen prior to turning HDR on. This would allow users to turn off flash entirely, if they so wished. Given the intense brightness of the LED flash bundled with the iPhone 4, this is not such an unlikely scenario.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt appears that the settings for the LED flash in the \"Off\" HDR mode aren't saved to disk upon quitting the app, if HDR is set to \"On\" just before the user hits the Home button. This causes the flash mode to revert to \"Auto\" upon relaunching the app and turning HDR back off, effectively disregarding what the user had specifically chosen prior to turning HDR on.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the problem does not occur on devices that don't support either flash or HDR photography.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
