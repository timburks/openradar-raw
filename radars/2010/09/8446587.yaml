    description: "17-Sep-2010 02:03 PM Jonathan Wight:\r\n'ProtocolTest.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n17-Sep-2010 02:03 PM Jonathan Wight:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUIWebView cannot load audio/video through a custom NSURLProtocol handler. All other web content I've tried (html, js, css & all images) load just fine via a NSURLProtocol handler. Video and audio will fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1: Download provided project.\r\n2: Note that a custom NSURLProtocol is being register and can handle URLs of the \"x-file:\" URL scheme\r\n2: Note that a UIWebView is being created and told to load a request with a \"x-file\" URL.\r\n3: Note that the .html web content loads just fine\r\n4: Click on the links to play video inline, note that video fails to load.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nVideo loads through my customized NSURLProtocol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nVideo fails to load. While the video does trigger a canInitWithRequest: message the video still does not load.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt seems that video/audio can only play via file: or http(s): urls. Custom URL schemes are not supported."
