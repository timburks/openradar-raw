    description: "22-Sep-2010 04:03 PM Juan De Dios Santander:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe built-in spelling check mechanism used by all Cocoa text fields does not recognize proper names, even when they exist in the user's address book.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTurn on Check Spelling While Typing.\r\nCreate an entry in Address Book for a foreign name or surname (i.e., Dobrzycki).\r\nWrite a text (in Safari, in Mail, or in TextEdit, for instance) containing Dobrzycki.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDobrzycki should be recognized from the address book entries, and not underlined.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTyped text shows foreign user names included in the Address Book, for instance the Dobrzycki example, underlined.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nShown in all versions of Mac OS X 10.6.x and 10.5.x, not checked in previous ones. Working correctly on iOS 4.x and at least 3.x, where surnames are even used for completion.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
