    description: "Summary: The new album list view occasionally reverts back to plain list view without list view being explicitly selected\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: After changing list view to album list view, double-click a song to start it. Go to the iTunes store, or another playlist. Then press Cmd + L, or click the currently playing playlist in the sidebar. Sometimes (and I haven't found a common way to reproduce) it will revert back to list view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Should remain as album list view\r\n\r\nActual Results: Plain list view\r\n\r\nRegression: Found this bug only in iTunes 10. Cannot consistently reproduce, but I have seen it happen more than once, and it seems it's a bug.\r\n\r\nNotes: Currently listening to \"Elephants\" by Them Crooked Vultures. What a rad album."
