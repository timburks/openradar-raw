    description: "I think a potentially useful iOS multitasking mode would be to allow an app to awaken when a particular bonjour service appears on the network (or perhaps also nearby via bluetooth) as well as allow even sleeping apps to maintain a broadcast of a bonjour service. This could be used by apps to transparently sync with desktop services or between apps themselves with no need for a middleman.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this was imagining the utility of a budgeting application that would sync values between my wife's iPhone and my own when they were home at night and on the same network. This would eliminate the need for an intermediate server as well as eliminate the need to actually start the apps on each device and perform some kind of a manual sync.\r\n\r\nI can think of some other uses for something like this as well. An example would be a department store that may have its own app. Rather than using a location-based system, the store could just have its own wifi and broadcast a service on it that awakens an installed app and alerts the customer to today's sales or specials or whatever.\r\n\r\nA similar thing would work well for certain kinds of games, but without the need (necessarily) of actually using location directly. Instead game clients could awake each other automatically by virtue of being on the same wifi network. For example, I may have the game installed on my iPhone but not be playing it. My friend knows I play the game, fires up his copy, and launches an attack on me. Since we're on the same wifi or within bluetooth range (for example), my app wakes up and sends a local notification allowing me to counter-attack or defend or whatever."
