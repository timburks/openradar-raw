    description: "Summary:\r\nRequesting the ability to customize the New Text Message sound/ringtone. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add new custom-built Ringtones to an iPhone (say via GarageBand + iTunes)\r\n2. Verify the new Ringtones in Settings > Sounds > Ringtone\r\n2. Look for the new Ringtones in Settings > Sounds > New Text Message \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to find and choose a new Ringtone for the New Text Message sound. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo new Ringtones listed there, and only the Apple-supplied sounds are available for New Text Message.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs on all iPhones tested so far, including the original iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 4.  I'm using an iPhone 4 running 4.0.2 8A400.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suggest making the custom-added Ringtones available to the New Text Message list.  If you have to, use only the non-DRM ringtones, because I'm very willing to generate or record and edit my own sounds that I own myself into a Ringtone.  I'd use short ones in the New Text Message.  \r\n\r\nAll too often, I hear an Apple-supplied Text Message sound in public, and it's not unique, so multiple nearby iPhone owners would check for messages.\r\n\r\n____\r\nOctober 2011: fixed in iOS 5!"
