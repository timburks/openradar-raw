    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari fails to load pages on the first relaunch after a crash.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT \r\n   This bug is NOT about the crash itself. I filed a separate bug on that. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 Use Safari\r\n2 Safari crashes.\r\n3 Launch Safari\r\n4 History > Reopen All Windows from Last Session\r\n5 No pages load\r\n6 Quit Safari\r\n7 Launch Safari\r\n8 You can load pages again\r\n\r\nThere are two problems here:\r\n#1 The pages don't load [hang]\r\n#2 Because the pages don't load, they aren't written to LastSession.plist. If Step 9 was History > Reopen All Windows from Last Session, nothing would open [dataloss]\r\n\r\nIf two fixes are necessary, please clone this Radar as needed.\r\n\r\nAttached are:\r\n1. System Profile\r\n2. Sample of Safari in stuck state (step 5)\r\n3. Crash log (step 2)\r\n\r\nRegression\r\nThis is new. It was possibly caused by Safari 5.0 or 5.0.1 (or 10.6.4). It didn't occur, say, three months ago."
