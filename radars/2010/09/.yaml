    description: "Support for the Geolocation API in Safari is a welcome addition (to the desktop in particular, as mobileSafari has had it for a while now). However, a big issue is its obnoxious behavior of asking the user for approval at least once every 24 hours. On a site like (the new) twitter.com, getting that request on a daily basis seems entirely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nPossible ways to go around this: \r\n\r\n- be less privacy concerned (bad)\r\n- allow user to create a whitelist to always grant some domains access (decent, but quite tech-y)\r\n- allow user the option to specify for how long not to be bugged with that question for a certain site (better)\r\n\r\nSites like maps.google.com and the new Twitter increase the need for a less obtrusive UI for Geolocation."
