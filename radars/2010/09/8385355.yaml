    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to create unit tests to fetch requests via the 'https' URL scheme, I found that NSURLConnection was always returning an error that the domain had an invalid certificate, even when it did not. This only happens when running the unit tests under the testing harness of the iOS SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new iPhone OS XCode project\r\n2. Create a new Cocoa Touch Unit Test Bundle target\r\n3. Switch target to Unit Test Bundle\r\n4. Create a new Cocoa Touch Objective C Unit Test Case file, with the code found here (interface and implementation are both provided):\r\n        https://gist.github.com/1e2e1adffd539bed5465\r\n5. Invoke the Build command\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAll tests pass.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAll tests fail.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe NSError returned looks like this:\r\n\r\nError Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1202 \"The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be “www.google.com” which could put your confidential information at risk.\" UserInfo=0xd122a0 {NSErrorFailingURLStringKey=https://www.google.com/, NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestion=Would you like to connect to the server anyway?, NSErrorFailingURLKey=https://www.google.com/, NSLocalizedDescription=The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be “www.google.com” which could put your confidential information at risk., NSUnderlyingError=0xd135e0 \"The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be “www.google.com” which could put your confidential information at risk.\", NSURLErrorFailingURLPeerTrustErrorKey=<SecTrustRef: 0x20d0bc0>}\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have consistently received this error, for any URL with a \"https\" scheme when running this test under the conditions given. The test passes when running as a normal executable code on the iOS SDK or on the MacOS SDK. The test even passes when running as a unit test for a MacOS project (versus a Cocoa Touch project and test suite).\r\n\r\nI am running XCode 3.2.3, with component versions:\r\n    Xcode IDE: 1688.0\r\n    Xcode Core: 1691.0\r\n    ToolSupport: 1591.0\r\nand the iOS 4.0.2 SDK"
