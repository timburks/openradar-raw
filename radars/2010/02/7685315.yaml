    description: Many IDEs provide a red/green bar for feedback on unit test success/failure. The bar is green when all project tests pass and red when they fail. Xcode provides this information for OCUnit-based Unit Test bundle targets as a green statement in the build window on success or a red build failure in the same window on test failure. This UI is not particularly salient, however. An enhancement would be to provide red/green feedback in the main window following a build.
