    description: "Summary: \r\nThe knowledge base article located at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237 shows a table of Intel-based Macs with their most recent version for the EFI Boot ROM and the SMC firmware. Since there is no easy way to find out the Mac name {e.g. MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009)} used in the table, it would be helpful if the table also listed the machine model (e.g. MacBook Pro 5,3) as shown by the System Profiler application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit the knowledge base article at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237\r\n2. Follow the steps shown in the article to find out the current ROM and firmware versions\r\n3. Look up the version values for the current Mac in the table of the article using only information found in the System Profiler.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe current Mac is easy to find because the table also shows the machine model (e.g. MacBook Pro 5,3) as can be seen in the System Profiler application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe administrator or user has to visit http://support.apple.com/specs and enter the Macâ€™s serial number in the search field or use third-party software such as Mactracker to find out the Mac name, before looking it up in the table.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be helpful if both the About this Mac panel and the System Profiler application listed the Mac name {e.g. MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009)}."
