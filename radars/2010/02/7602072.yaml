    description: "03-Feb-2010 01:44 AM Barry Teoh:\r\n1. Build any iPhone app (i,e. target 3.1.2)\r\n2. After it installs onto the device modify the code a little bit (For example add a NSLog statement)\r\n3. Try to do \"Build and Go\" again and you get the error \"A Signed Resource has been added, modified, or deleted.\"\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to delete the binary on the device and repeat 3 again and you do not see the error."
