    description: "Summary: \r\nRunning \"dscacheutil -flushcache\" from the Terminal kills any iTunes Home Sharing connections, interrupting playback of audio, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to an iTunes 9 or greater shared library\r\n2. Initiate playback of any music within said library\r\n3. Open Terminal\r\n4. Execute \"dscacheutil -flushcache\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is expected that audio playback would continue and that the shared library would not be disconnected as  executing \"dscacheutil -flushcache\" does not interfere with other network operations, i.e. file transfer and instant messaging.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio playback ceases, shared libraries are disconnected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is recognized that typical users will not come across this issue. When performing systems administrator tasks, however, it can become necessary to clear DNS cache with some regularity."
