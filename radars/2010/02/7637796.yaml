    description: "Please add some more refactorings - see the Intellij IDEA product for details.\r\n\r\nOnes that come to mind are:\r\n\r\nIntroduce variable, \r\nTurns the highlighted bit of code into a variable, defined on the line above and replaces code with the variable.\r\nOptionally replacing any similar uses of that code fragment with the variable, that are in scope.\r\n\r\nIntroduce constant,\r\nSimilar to above, but creates a constant.\r\n\r\nIntroduce field,\r\nSimilar to above, but creates an instance variable - perhaps with a little dialog to choose option like retain/synthesize etc\r\n\r\nIntroduce Parameter,\r\nAs above, but adds a new param to the current method.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nChris"
