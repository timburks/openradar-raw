    description: "08-Feb-2010 03:10 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nSTR:\r\nCreate an XIB file containing an NSPopUpButton. Assign an image that is larger than the popup button to one of the menu items (you can just make up a nonexistent image name, the placeholder fulfills the criteria). Look at the \"Warnings\" list in IB's \"Document Info\" window.\r\n\r\n-> \"Document Info\" warns that the popup button was clipping its contents.\r\n-> The popup button itself scales down the image\r\n\r\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:\r\n-> It shouldn't warn about scaled images.\r\n\r\nThe same problem occurs with an NSButton set to be borderless and image-only. Even though the button is set to scale down its images, IB claims it was clipping its contents.\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible to have a warnings-free build with XIB files."
