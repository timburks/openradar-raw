    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter playing an HTTP stream using MPMoviePlayerController, the movie player fails to play any local media files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the MoviePlayer sample project (version 1.3) provided with the SDK.\r\n2. In the \"Streaming\" tab, type in the URL of an HTTP stream (live broadcast or VOD).\r\nFor instance, use one your sample streams:\r\nhttp://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbop/gear1/prog_index.m3u8 \r\n3. Let the HTTP stream play for a few seconds (or longer, it does not matter) and stop it.\r\n4. Switch to the \"Local\" tab and tap the button to play the local movie.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe local movie should load and play.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe local movie does not load.\r\nThe activity indicator is displayed for a while and then the player fails with the error: \"This movie could not be played.\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The problem occurs on all SDK versions from 3.0 to 3.1.3.\r\n- The problem occurs both on the device and the simulator."
