    description: "10-Feb-2010 10:08 PM Alan Hogan:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nThere should be a user-friendly way for iPhone Apps and/or iPhone Web Apps to prompt users to install bookmarklets.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\n\r\n- Have a way for web apps, iPhone SDK apps, or both to invoke a dialog that prompts the user to install a bookmark with a specified title and URL into their Mobile Safari bookmark list.\r\n\r\nPossible Means:\r\n\r\n- Users should be able to add a bookmarklet from iPhone Safari by tapping and holding on a bookmarklet link, that is, a web page anchor whose location begins with \"javascript:\", or \r\n- a WebKit-specific JavaScript call, or \r\n- via the iPhone SDK.  \r\n\r\nCurrent Alternative:\r\n\r\n- Gnarly instructions such as \"paste this odd-looking string into a bookmark you just created's location field\" must be given to the user instead, such as those used for Marco Arment's Instapaper.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a dupe of rdar://6589436 and rdar://5935641\r\n\r\nThank you, and cheers."
