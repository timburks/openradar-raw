    description: "Select 4+ photos.\r\nEdit in Fullscreen.\r\nPoint at the upper-left of a top-row photo to remove it from the display.\r\n\r\nObserved: The menu bar & thumbnail strip pop down, covering the close X.\r\n\r\nExpected: There needs to be sufficient (more) room on the close/remove X for the individual photos being edited, before tripping the menubar/thumbnail popdown."
