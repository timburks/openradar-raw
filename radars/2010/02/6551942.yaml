    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm connecting to a network that requires DHCPv6 for obtaining an IPv6 address instead of stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC).   The system is not getting an IPv6 address at all, so I am unable to get on the net at this location.   It appears that the ipv6 dhcp client service is failing or is non-existent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect to an IPv6 network that uses DHCP instead of SLAAC for obtaining addresses.   In \"Network Preferences\", set \"Configure IPv6\" to \"Automatically\".   Wait for IPv6 address to be configured.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn IPv6 address should appear, and be viewable with \"ifconfig\", as is the case on SLAAC based networks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn IPv6 address never appears.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem does not appear on networks that are configured for SLAAC.   The problem only exists on networks that are \"managed\" or \"stateful\", and where SLAAC is not available.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe're starting to see more situations where SLAAC is not supported, because it is not compatible with the IVI translator.\r\nAlso note that I also have the problem on my iPhone."
