    description: Setting a long title on a segment in a UISegmentedControl in a UIToolbar causes the text to float outside of the bounds of the control.  Setting "clip subviews" will confine the text to the UISegmentedControl, but not to the given segment.  It would be terrific if the private UILabel where the title is drawn were exposed in a manner similar to the UILabel in a UIButton.
