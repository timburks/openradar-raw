    description: "DUPLICATING BUG #7694493, for the purpose of expressing the importance of this bug.\r\n\r\niPhone developers collect sales reports daily to monitor the sales of their applications. The only official way to do this is to:\r\n\r\n1) Login to iTunes Connect.\r\n2) Manually navigate to the report.\r\n3) Download the report in your browser.\r\n4) Load the report into an external application.\r\n5) View the data.\r\n\r\nThis is a time consuming and error-prone procedure. As developers, we automate whenever we can. The result are several popular products that manage iTunes Connect sales data:\r\n\r\n<http://www.ideaswarm.com/products/appviz/>\r\n<https://www.appfigures.com/>\r\n<http://www.drobnik.com/touch/my-app-sales/>\r\n\r\nOne simple click and a developer gets all their sales information. These applications function by scraping the contents of the web pages on iTunes Connect. Whenever there is a change to these pages the automated process breaks. This happens often.\r\n\r\nIt would be advantageous to provide a REST-based API or WebDAV/FTP site where reports can be downloaded. This API would allow Apple a better channel for notifying developers of delays (we don't visit the web pages) and provides a stable interface for data acquisition."
