    description: "The lower-right size slider isn't very precise. When I change monitors, it takes a significant amount of fussing before I can get thumbnails as large as possible, to fit 4 or 8 across the screen in the main view.\r\n\r\nThe slider should snap to the largest sizes which fit each number of thumbnails. I cannot think of any reason I'd want to waste pixels on extra whitespace.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to change the default behavior, then sliding the control with Option or Shift held down should jump between optimal sizes (as does resizing the Dock with Option held down)."
