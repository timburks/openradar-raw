    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen Xcode has been configured to use an external editor for files of type 'sourcecode', Find & Replace no longer functions as expected across multiple files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Under Preferences > File Types, set files of type 'sourcecode' to use an external editor, e.g. TextMate or TextEdit.\r\n2. In any project with several source files, use Find & Replace to find some string that is common across more than one file.\r\n3. Type something into the Replace box to replace the results with. Make sure \"In Project\" is selected. Click Replace.\r\n4. Xcode will ask you to confirm you want to replace XX occurrences. Confirm.\r\n5. Click \"Find\" again to check that there are no results (i.e. your replace was succesful).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect the Replace to work as normal and for my Find results for the original string to be empty after running the replace operation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost of the time, none of the occurrences are actually replaced. Sometimes, some of them are replaced (possibly in any files that happen to be open in Xcode already). Repeatedly clicking Replace and confirming makes no difference, it just won't perform the replace.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have recorded a brief screencast demonstrating this problem here: http://screenr.com/xHx - this screencast also covers another related problem to do with Header switching which I will cover in a separate bug report.\r\n\r\nA related problem, concerning the \"Switch to header/implementation\" command has been filed: rdar://7637708"
