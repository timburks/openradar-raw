    description: "Summary: \r\nQuick Look appears to use a case-sensitive UTI lookup when choosing the generator. However, when the content type is assigned to items as metadata, it appears to be lowercased automatically. Thus, Quick Look generators designed to respond to mixed-case UTIs will never be used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a sample app that exports the UTI \"com.example.MyAwesomeUTI\"\r\n2. Create a generator that also responds to \"com.example.MyAwesomeUTI\"\r\n3. Create a dummy file that inherits that UTI\r\n4. Attempt to use Quick Look to preview the file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file should be previewed using Quick Look\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe above will likely fail. If you then check the file with `mdls`, kMDItemContentType should show \"com.example.myawesomeuti\", the lowercase version of what it should be. Running the following:\r\n\r\nqlmanage -c com.example.MyAwesomeUTI -p /path/to/theFile\r\n\r\n... should force Quick Look to display with the uppercase version of the UTI, and the display will succeed."
