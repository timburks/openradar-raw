    description: "-[NSMutableDictionary removeObjectsForKey:] raises an exception if aKey is nil, but does not document this fact. For example, methods like -[NSMutableArray replaceObjectAtIndex:withObject:] have callout boxes containing such a warning paired with each such parameter.\r\n\r\nThis information is important not only for avoiding exceptions in code that calls this methods, but also for impedance matching of similar functionality in third-party code with Cocoa. Unless the developer knows that an exception will be raised, it is difficult to know what must be checked for, and there is the possibility of preventable programming errors.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, -[NSMutableDictionary setObject:forKey:] requires that keys conform to NSCopying. What happens if they don't? Is an exception raised? This should be made clear so developers can code accordingly.\r\nï¿¼"
