    description: "It would be very great and convenient if Apple could build an iTunes connect client or API for iPhone Developers, so they could manage everything on the iTunes Connect from a convenient native Cocoa application.\r\n\r\nThis would greatly reduce the sluggishness, data transfer requirements, and slow performance of itunesconnect.apple.com, and it will greatly increase the user experience of iPhone Developers, as it has been witnessed by most of iPhone developers when they are using the iTunes Connect website.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThis enhancement could be a part of iTunes Sales Report APi or overall it will be an iTunes Connect API."
