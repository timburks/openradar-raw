    description: "Summary:\r\nOne application will claim the menubar. Upon attempting to switch to another running application via the keyboard, dock or Exposé, the new application window will be brought to the foreground, but in \"Inactive\" state. The menubar will remain on the first application. The \"new\" application will not be controllable, the user cannot enter text, and there is no way to launch Activity Monitor or the Force Quit dialog. The only sure fix is a forced reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI cannot find an accurate, single way of reproducing this bug. It has happened more than once in a day, then not for weeks at a time. However, it has occurred several times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the application to change focus, for the new application to use its menubar, and to be controllable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menubar didn't change, the application didn't properly change focus and the keyboard was inactive for the foreground application.\r\n\r\nRegressions:\r\nI've heard anecdotes of this happening to others, but I'm unsure of their system configurations. I do know that it happens on my MacBook Pro (mid-2007). I had the logic board replaced recently, under a recall for the graphics card. It was originally a 2.2 GHz Core 2 Duo and they swapped in a 2.4 C2D. However, this has occurred on both configurations. I haven't found a constant source of the problem, as it has happened with a few different applications (Safari, Bluebird and iTunes) being the initial focus.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached log matches the timecode of the problem occurring last night.\r\n\r\n16-Feb-2010 12:02 PM Nicholas Heer:\r\nSteps to Reproduce (more info):\r\nFigured it might be nice to have more info. The problem occurs mostly while in normal use. It's a regular home directory, with an admin account. I use the keyboard to switch windows, however it does occur when using Exposé or the mouse, too."
