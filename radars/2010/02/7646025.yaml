    description: "Aperture's places view is great but it's extremely difficult to use with a Magic Mouse because of the scroll-to-zoom behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen using the map, the slightest touch on the mouse shell (such as may happen when placing the hand on the mouse) will cause the map to zoom wildly away from the carefully-set location that one intended to place photos into.\r\n\r\nWith the Magic Mouse's momentum scrolling, this is doubly bad, as the zoom will keep going until the momentum dissipates.\r\n\r\nPlease consider either outright disabling scroll-to-zoom or providing a preference for turning it off in Aperture.  It makes the map view really difficult to use."
