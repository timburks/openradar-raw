    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Audio Midi Setup.app, a non-admin user is allowed to change the speaker setup for any/every output device, however this setting is not saved despite the \"apply\" button being clicked, as Audio Midi Setup silently fails to write it to /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nAs a non-admin user:\r\n\r\n1. Start Audio Midi setup\r\n2. Choose an audio output device capable of multiple speaker setups (this can be emulated with soundflower.app from cycling '74 if no appropriate device is available).\r\n3. Click \"configure speakers\"\r\n4. Choose \"Multichannel\" and choose any setup from the menu other than the default\r\n5. Click \"apply\"\r\n6. Click \"done\"\r\n7. Quit \"Audio Midi Setup\"\r\n8. Repeat steps 1-3. It will be obvious that the setting set in step 4 has not been saved\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEither the user should be prompted to authenticate as an admin so that the change can be applied\r\nor\r\nThe setting should be saved as a ByHost preference for the non-admin user\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe setting is not saved at all for a non-admin user\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPresent in 10.5.8 and 10.6.2\r\n\r\nNotes.\r\n\r\nSoundflower (mentioned above is available here:  http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/audio/soundflower.html\r\n\r\nFrom running dtruss, what appears to happen is Audio Midi Setup tries to write to /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist and fails without any user feedback. This seems like a goiod candidate for a ByHost preference setting."
