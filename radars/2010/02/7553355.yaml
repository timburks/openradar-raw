    description: "NS(Mutable)Dictionary has the following methods:\r\n\r\n- (id)initWithObjects:(NSArray *)objects forKeys:(NSArray *)keys;\r\n+ (id)dictionaryWithObjects:(NSArray *)objects forKeys:(NSArray *)keys;\r\n\r\nNSMutableDictionary has -addEntriesFromDictionary: but this isn't very useful when the keys and values are already in parallel NSArrays (e.g. they were passed to me in that form, and I need to add them to an existing array, possibly replacing some values). One workaround is to create another dictionary using -initWithObjects:forKeys: and adding those entries using this method, but it wastes memory and time. Iterating through both arrays and calling -setObject:forKey: also works, but is unwieldy and it could almost certainly be done in a faster way internally."
