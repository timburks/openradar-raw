    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is not possible to configure an IPv6 address for a printer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFrom \"System Preferences\" select \"Print & Fax\".  Hit \"+\" to add a printer.  In the box where it asks for your address, enter the Printer's IPv6 address.  In our case the address entered was 2001:480:822:179::147\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe IP address should have been accepted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get an error message: \"Invalid or incomplete address.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe error always occurs, on all systems.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a serious problem for our printers that live on IPv6-only networks, or printers that are configured for IPv6-only.   The MACs can't print to them.\r\n\r\n----  Response from Apple Engineering ----\r\n\r\n30-Jul-2009 10:24 AM:\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nThere is no manual configuration of IPv6 printers in OS X.  If the pritner supports Bonjour, then it will favor the IPv6 address.  Or you can give the printer a name and your dns server can serve-up an IPv6 address."
