    description: "It would be really useful it it were possible to denote an attribute in a Core Data entity as \"unique\".  For example, If I have an entity \"Person\" with an attribute \"socialSecurityNumber\" (String), this would be an excellent candidate for uniquing.\r\n\r\nIf I insert a new Person into the managed object context with an SSN of \"123-45-6789\", then it should succeed if no existing Person has that same SSN.  If someone does, then the insert should fail and return nil (or fill an NSError object, etc).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to work around this is to ascertain before insertion if another instance has that attribute.  This can be accomplished via a fetch request (potentially expensive) or caching the known values in memory (potentially memory intensive)."
