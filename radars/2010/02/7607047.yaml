    description: "03-Feb-2010 07:03 AM Paul Goracke:\r\nSummary: \r\ncom.apple.dock.iconcache file becomes unwritable, causing new icons to be lo-res\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI am not sure what causes this to happen, but it seems to be related to error messages like \"2/3/10 6:15:28 AM\t/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/OSServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/CSConfigDotMacCert[465]\tMDS Error: unable to create user DBs in /var/folders/Ha/HaPCwT7uETKlKwNbvL85e++++TM/-Caches-//mds\" found via Console.\r\n\r\nI was noticing that icons where starting to look low resolution in the dock. It wasn't so noticeable in the dock itself, since I keep that small, but when using Cmd-Tab it looked terrible. I thought it was third-party apps primarily, but then the 9.0.3. iTunes update also looked bad so I realized it was newly added icon resources which indicates a bad cache.\r\n\r\nI deleted the /var/folders subfolders, logged out then back in, and the icons are beautiful once again.\r\n\r\nI realize this doesn't help figure out _why_ the caches become inaccessible but hopefully this can provide a data point.\r\n\r\nI have shared this information in the Apple Support Discussion Forums: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2132399&start=135&tstart=0\r\n\r\npg"
