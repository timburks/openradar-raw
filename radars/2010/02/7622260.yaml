    description: "07-Feb-2010 10:12 AM Jon Thompson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nApple remote pairing/unpairing does not follow the convention of being able to be modified as long as and administrator has authenticated the Security System Preference, no matter the ability level of the user logged in. Instead, it requires the administrator to physically log in, which this is the sole time that I have found that necessitates this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an admin user, Create a nonadmin user.\r\nLog in as nonadmin user.\r\nGo to the Security SP and authenticate as the admin user.\r\nTry and pair an Apple remote.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPairing button becomes available\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPairing button stays gray.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNo idea what versions this affects."
