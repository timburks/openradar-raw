    description: "I use an X.509 certificate to sign my email and encrypt messages to other users. On occasion, a message I send to a person who has no such certificate is encrypted. This has happened numerous times when sending a normal email to my wife, and seemingly always after I have sent an encrypted email to another person. My wife doesn't have any sort of certificate, and my keychain doesn't even contain a secure iChat certificate for her. (We are both MobileMe users.) She can't decrypt the message, and it shows up as a .p7m attachment.\r\n\r\nWhen I send a message to her that ends up being encrypted, the lock icon is unlocked and gray, signifying that the message should be unencrypted. (I always leave signing enabled, though.) It seems that every message I send to her is encrypted until I begin composing a new email to an individual with a certificate (at which point the lock icon changes to enabled and locked, signifying encryption is on) and turn off encryption.\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure what public key Mail would be using to encrypt. If it would help, I can try to reproduce and attach an encrypted email message and screenshot of what it looks like for her. I'm sure there must be something in the message that indicates an identity to use for decryption, but I haven't found one yet."
