    description: "When trying to use the Developer Forums (htttp://devforums.apple.com), AJAX is used to power the message board pagination.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the pagination works in such a way that the URL in the location bar is not updated, pressing the browser back button will always take you back to the first page.\r\n\r\nExample scenario:\r\n\r\nYou are browsing through the topics in any given forum. You paginate through to page 3, find a thread you want to read and click it to read the thread. When you are done, you hit the back button on your browser and find yourself back on page 1 of the forum.\r\n\r\nI use Safari but I imagine this is a general issue.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if either:\r\n\r\na) AJAX was not used for pagination; it seems to add little value, or\r\nb) AJAX was used as a progressive enhancement, where the pagination links act as normal hyperlinks in the absence of Javascript and use of the back button i spossible."
