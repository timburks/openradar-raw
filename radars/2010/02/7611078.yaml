    description: "Highlighting a variable within a given scope and the Edit > Edit All in Scope command nearly always works as expected, but I've found a case where they don't. As of Xcode 3.2.1, \"normal\" variable declarations (with only one variable declared in a given statement) are recognized, as is the first variable in a declaration, but any subsequent variables are not. Here is a simple concrete example:\r\n\r\nint main(void) {\r\n\tint foo = 1, bar = 2, baz = 3;\r\n\tprintf(\"%d %d %d\\n\", foo, bar, baz);\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf this code is saved in a .c file and opened in Xcode, clicking on foo will display underlines below each location where it appears in the code, but this does not happen for bar and baz. It doesn't matter whether I click on the declaration or any usage of the variable — nothing I tried will get it to highlight. This is obviously a toy example, but I came upon it when trying to rename a variable that appears nearly 20 times in a given method, and Xcode was inexplicably unable/unwilling to help me.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Xcode is just ignoring the subsequent declarations, even though they are syntactically valid. One may argue that it is poor form to declare multiple variables in one statement in this manner, but some programmers prefer this style, some projects define a set coding style, etc. Regardless, this behavior is pretty clearly a bug — it seems unreasonable that this would be the desired behavior.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs anywhere variables are defined with a comma, whether or not they have initial values. For example, from <rdar://problem/6873242>:\r\n\r\nmain() {\r\n    int var1, var2;\r\n    var1 = var2 * 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\nHere, \"Edit All in Scope\" works for var1, but not var2.\r\n\r\nmain() {\r\n    int var1;\r\n    int var2;\r\n    var1 = var2 * 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\nHere, \"Edit All in Scope\" can be use with both variables.\r\n\r\nFrom <rdar://problem/6808264>:\r\n\r\nfor (NSUInteger i = 0, size = [array count]; i < size; i++) {\r\n    printf(\"%lu of %lu\\n\", i, size);\r\n}\r\n\r\nHere, \"Edit All in Scope\" works for i, but not for size."
