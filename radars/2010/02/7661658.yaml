    description: "See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map for background if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn Safari 4, the View > Zoom In / Out commands change the scale of an entire webpage, including the images. The problem is that the image map coordinates don't seem to be correct; the clickable areas no longer line up over the correct places on the image.\r\n\r\nFor example, scaling down this page causes the areas to become misaligned.\r\n\r\nhttp://dysart.cs.byu.edu/CHDataStructures/inherits.html\r\n\r\nI realize that image maps are less popular in modern code, and are probably considered an ugly stepchild approach, but they are still used, and Safari should do its best to have them work correctly, regardless of the zoom level."
