    description: "It is unclear whether the preferred action is to always allow a Revert to Saved and not display the ellipsis (TextEdit) or to grey out the menu item if there are no unsaved changes and use the ellipsis (Preview).\r\n\r\nIf you don't grey out the menu, you give the user the opportunity to force the app to reload the document, in case it was changed on the filesystem but the changes aren't reflected in the app.\r\n\r\nPlease clear up this ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nRevert to Saved has no ellipsis in the HIG docs:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGMenus/XHIGMenus.html\r\n\r\nUsing the Ellipsis character in the docs states that an ellipsis should be used if a command always requires confirmation:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGText/XHIGText.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000365-TPXREF126"
