    description: "12-Feb-2010 12:27 AM Karl Adam:\r\nWhen compiling static libraries with ObjC code in them if they have categories in them it's necessary to link them passing the -ObjC flag to ld which loads all symbols for any shared library that has any ObjC symbols. This worked fine for i386 binaries but when compiling x86-64, armv6 or armv7 code it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this is to use -all_load, but the problem with -all_load is that it forces all symbols for all linked shared libraries to be loaded into your binary at link time.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this bug, you can check out MPOAuth in which I've recreated all the many ways in which this will fail complete with unit tests which will helpfully fai\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) svn checkout http://mpoauthconnection.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mpoauth\r\n2) Remove -all_load from OTHER_LD_FLAGS aka \"Other linker flags\" in the Static Library Targets(libMPOAuth and libMPOAuthMac) for iPhone and Mac\r\n3) Compile \"Build All\" target and let the Unit Tests run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) All the unit tests run successfully\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ni386 Tests run successfully, all others, x86_64, armv6, and armv7 fail.\r\n\r\n13-Feb-2010 03:45 AM Karl Adam:\r\nI should also point out that because this works in i386 builds and the simulator runs as a i386 process the problem doesn't manifest in the simulator. So it is unlikely to be apparent to many developers why their code would work fine in one place but not the other despite being exactly the same code and flags."
