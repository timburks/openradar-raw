    description: "When Xcode has been configured to use an external editor for files of type 'sourcecode', the \"Switch to Header/Source File\" option no longer works unless both files are already open within Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure all project files are closed.\r\n2. Open a single implementation (.m) file.\r\n3. Select View > Switch to Header/Source File.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe corresponding header file should be opened and made the active document.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. The header file is not opened and there is no indication that something went wrong.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's worth noting that if both the corresponding header and implementation file are open in Xcode, then \"Switch to Header/Source File\" works as expected. It is only when one is open that switching does not work.\r\n\r\nI have recorded a brief screencast demonstrating this problem here: http://screenr.com/xHx - this screencast also covers another related problem to do with Find & Replace which I will cover in a separate bug report.\r\n\r\nA related issue, concerning \"Find & Replace\" has been filed: rdar://7637666"
