    description: "Summary:\r\nGetting the scroll offset of a UIWebView is currently only possible through undocumented methods. It would be much better if this was documented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne would expect that there would be a way to programmatically scroll a UIWebView. It would be great if there were a properly on UIWebView to get and set the scroll position and possibly the visible rect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis used to be possible by using undocumented methods on UIScroller (which is also undocumented), but is no longer an option as applications using undocumented API calls are now rejected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand that you have chosen not to document UIScroller and the rest of the UIWebView internals (such as UIWebDocumentView). I am just asking for some of the scrolling functionality to be exposed."
