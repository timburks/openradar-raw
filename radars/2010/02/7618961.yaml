    description: "Documentation error:\r\n\r\nThe documentation says the textColor property is nil by default. This doesn't seem to be the case. A newly allocated UITextField returns a textColor object with a class of UICachedDeviceWhiteColor.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can't set the textColor value to nil without getting an exception. Based on the documentation I would expect that I could set the value to nil to return to the default color."
