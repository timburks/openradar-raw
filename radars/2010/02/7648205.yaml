    description: "While coding Objective-C, I'll frequently need to call a superclass' implementation of a method. Routinely, I'll need to pass the same parameters that my method got passed to super's implementation. Therefore, this should be able to do using autocomplete.\r\n\r\nWhen in an Objective-C .m file, and want to call a super's method, the first word I type is \"super\". When I type this, the autocomplete window should pop up with a recommendation for \"super\". If I select it, it should replace the \"super\" with the full line of code.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nFor a method with this signature:\r\n\r\n-(void)drawRect:(NSRect)aRect{ ... }\r\n\r\nInvoking this \"super\" autocomplete should print:\r\n\r\n[super drawRect:aRect];\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for this signature:\r\n\r\n-(NSString *)foo:(id)aFoo bar:(id)aBar baz:(id)someBaz{ ... }\r\n\r\nInvoking \"super\"'s autocomplete should print one of these, possibly based on context:\r\n\r\nNSString *value = [super foo:aFoo bar:aBar baz:someBaz];\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n[super foo:aFoo bar:aBar baz:someBaz];\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis addition would significantly speed up coding, especially in situations where subclasses need to override a lot of methods, while still invoking super's implementation (such as UIViewController subclasses on iPhone, where methods like -viewWillAppear: and -viewDidAppear: are often overridden in subclasses)."
