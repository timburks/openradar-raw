    description: "Summary:\r\nQCPathController is not documented. All of this information is for OS 10.4-10.6.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that QCPathController would be documented. It would be nice to be able to use its type when creating outlets to them and such. I would also like to be able to create them programmatically.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nQCPathController is not documented. Its type is not valid and throws a compile error of unknown type (on OS 10.4-10.6). You cannot create them programatically.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
