    description: "Safari accepts URLs that contain a username and password at the front, like so:\r\n\r\nhttp://username:password@www.example.com/some/path/\r\n\r\nThe username and password are passed on to the web server, and authentication successfully takes place.\r\n\r\nHowever, once the authentication has occurred and the page is loaded, the URL remains unchanged. Further, relative links on the same site preserve the username and password at the front of the URL. Generally, it is desirable to leave the location bar unchanged, but if the URL contains a password, not so much.\r\n\r\nFirefox handles this scenario somewhat better. It first prompts to make sure you want to login, and if so, it rewrites the URL to exclude the username and password fragment. The confirmation lets the user know that they are logging into a site, and reduces the surprise when the URL is modified. This would be a great feature for Safari on the odd occasion that such a URL is used. It would certainly be better for users' security."
