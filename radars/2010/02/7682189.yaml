    description: "Summary: \r\nSometimes, upon closing my MacBook (Jan. 2008) and opening the lid back up, OS X decides to act very strange.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Shut MacBook's lid.\r\n2.) Open MacBook's lid.\r\n3.) Wait for it to wake up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEverything to appear and function as it did before I closed the lid.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The menu bar switches to opaque. \r\n- No icons are shown on my desktop. They appear in the Finder window when I browse to ~/Desktop.\r\n- The cursor turns into a fuzzy little white / black box until a program explicitly changes the cursor. I used the screen capture utility to turn it into the camera then back into the pointer.\r\n- If the MacBook is plugged into an external display, then resumed from sleep, the dekstop wallpaper on the MacBook is changed to the default Aurora.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm running 10.6.2 on a MacBook3,1 (Jan. 2008). \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSystem Profiler Report and screenshot is attached."
