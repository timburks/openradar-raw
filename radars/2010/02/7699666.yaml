    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt is no longer possible to manually start GUI programs with another User account.\r\nFast user switching is fine for switching between accounts for separate humans, however,\r\nit is also valuable to be able to run processes under different accounts, all managed by a single person.\r\nFor example, I have a \"git\" user and several other accounts running daemons so that I can share\r\ndata with friends and colleagues. I manage these accounts via the Terminal & shell from my normal user account. This means that I can reference my personal data (e.g.: email descriptions of problem reports and notes that I've kept from previous actions) while simultaneously working on the other account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nStart Terminal.app\r\nSwitch to another user on the local machine\r\nStart any GUI application\r\n\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\n% su - {user}\r\n% open /Applications/Automator.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe application should appear on the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n% open /Applications/Automator.app\r\nLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/Automator.app\r\n\r\n% open /Applications/Vim.app\r\nSun Feb 28 16:15:55 hymie Vim[1240] <Error>: kCGErrorFailure: Set a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged.\r\n_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly until at least OS X 10.5.8\r\n\r\nNotes:"
