    description: "Summary:\r\nImageUnitAnalyzer successfully analyzes an Image Unit when run in xterm, but fails the same Image Unit when run as part of an Xcode build.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an Image Unit.\r\n2. In xterm or Terminal, use ImageUnitAnalyzer to test the Image Unit.\r\n3. Add a shell script phase that uses ImageUnitAnalyzer to test the Image Unit.\r\n4. Build again, thereby running the script phase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImageUnitAnalyzer validates the IU in both runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImageUnitAnalyzer passes the IU when run from xterm or Terminal, but fails the exact same build when run in Xcode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe shell script phase has one input file, which is $(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(WRAPPER_NAME), and the script is:\r\n\r\nImageUnitAnalyzer \"$SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0\"\r\n\r\nI have also tried prefixing this with env -i, to run ImageUnitAnalyzer without the environment that Xcode sets up. This made no difference.\r\n\r\nThe failure output is:\r\n\r\n##############################################################\r\n###########  Image Unit Analyzer Tool Version 1.1  ###########\r\n###########  Copyright 2005, Apple Computer, Inc.  ###########\r\n##############################################################\r\n\r\nVALIDATING IMAGE UNIT: /Volumes/RAM Disk/Builds/Debug/Nearest_Neighbor.plugin\r\n\r\n\r\nVALIDATING IMAGE UNIT BUNDLE \r\n- PASS: Image Unit has correct extension plugin\r\n- PASS: Description.plist exists /Volumes/RAM Disk/Builds/Debug/Nearest_Neighbor.plugin/Contents/Resources/Description.plist\r\nERROR: The Image Unit is not build for x86_64\r\n\r\nVerification of /Volumes/RAM Disk/Builds/Debug/Nearest_Neighbor.plugin failed with code: -1 \r\n** FAIL\r\nCommand /bin/sh failed with exit code 255\r\n\r\nThe path is correct; I can copy and paste it to the aforementioned xterm, and ImageUnitAnalyzer will again pass the IU.\r\n\r\nPhotographic evidence is attached.

I've clarified it in the title: ImageUnitAnalyzer 1.1 is not seeing that the plug-in does, in fact, have an x86_64 architecture."
