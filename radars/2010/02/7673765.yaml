    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nIntelliJ IDEA automatically inserts import statements while you are typing, and detects non-imported classes found in pasted blocks of code. When a class is found, that has not yet been imported, IntelliJ IDEA displays a hint and allows you to quickly insert the required statement with Alt+Enter. \r\n\r\nHaving something similar in Xcode would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would work like so:\r\n\r\n1. In Xcode type \"CalTask *newTask = nil;\"\r\n2. A drop-down appears asking if you want to import <CalendarStore/CalendarStore.h>\r\n3. Press Command-Enter and \"import <CalendarStore/CalendarStore.h>\" is added to the top of the class's .m file."
