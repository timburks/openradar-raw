    description: "It would be useful to have a STWarn() macro similar to STFail(), just takes one argument and used like:\r\n\r\nSTWarn(@\"Test not yet implemented\");\r\n\r\nUseful for placeholders or temporary notices that bugs need to be fixed. Could produce a yellow-bubble style warning in XCode."
