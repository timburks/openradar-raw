    description: "http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSEvent/mouseLocation\r\n\r\nThere is a note attached to the class method +[NSEvent mouseLocation]  that says:\r\n\r\n\"The y coordinate in the returned point starts from a base of 1, not 0.\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't figure out what this meant at first, as it implies that all of the returned y coordinates are offset by 1. \r\n\r\nA quick test showed this to be incorrect.  I then realised that what it really means is:\r\n\r\n\"The y coordinate is never smaller than 1\"  \r\n\r\nAs the mouse pointer is stopped at the y=1 position.\r\n\r\nAn update of this note in the documentation would help clarify what is going on with mouse coordinates.\r\n\r\nThis has been updated by Apple in the documentation."
