    description: "17-Feb-2010 09:45 AM Dallas Brown:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is currently no easy way to tell Xcode to build and deploy an iPhone app on a device, without launching the application after deployment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an iPhone app and try to deploy to a device without launching the application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a build option of 'Build and Deploy' along with 'Build an Debug' that can also be assigned a keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no easy way to build and deploy without launching the app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only currently known workaround is to do just a build and then drag the application from \"products\" section in your projects files into the Applications section of the device you want to install on within the Organizer. This is neither well known nor quick and easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n22-Feb-2010 02:18 PM [Name Redacted] :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nCould you please tell us why you're interested in adding this ability?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27-Feb-2010 01:12 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nThere are several reason that occur for me (I know others have the same reasons/wishes as well as others reasons)\r\n\r\nOne reason is for testing intercommunication between applications using url schema.\r\nFor example I register my app to respond to the schmea newsprint:// and I want to install this new code on the device and test it with another app, be it mobile safari or a 3rd part app. Currently I have to build and install which means I have to wait for it to build, wait for it to install and then wait for it to run (which can take longer to run when using build and go then if you just launch the app). Once the app finally gets to the point that I can kill it, I can close the app and start my actual testing. (This example is the same for testing things like bluetooth and WiFi connections between apps for game play code)\r\nThis would have been so much easier and faster if I could simply say, build and install, but don't run.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is if you are wanting to test launch speeds. Currently you must go through the entire process above, including launching the app, just so you can close to that just to open it again in a non-connected way.\r\nOnce again a simple build, install, but dont run would make the process so much easier and faster.\r\n\r\nThis same example becomes even worse if you are trying to test launch speed of your initial launch, as Xcode will launch for you, screwing up your \"first run\" making it so if you close and launch again you are no longer on the apps first run.\r\nTherefore we have to code in something to clear out any preferences and/or any files that are made on first launch. Take for example a Core Data app which comes with a \"sample\" or \"starter\" database. Because of the way we have to work with delivering files and the sandbox, we have to place this sample within the app and then on first run copy it out into say the documents folder.\r\nTherefore if Xcode runs this we have to have a way to remove this file within code and a special button or something (since we don't have access to the devices directory system manually) so we can test launch time with this happening.\r\n\r\nA less normal yet still important example would be say I have just made a change to the code and I have to hurry and leave somewhere, so I figure it is a good chance to do some real world testing in various 3G and Edge areas. Once again I have to wait for not only the build and the install but the launch to get to a point where I can close it.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that if you try and kill the launching of the application (even using Xcode's big red Stop button) before the application has finished launch completely, bad things can happen. For example I have had simply pressing the stop button during a launch process hang my iPhone to the point that I had to do a hard reboot and the reboot process took 3x longer then normal.\r\nIt should also be stated that even if killing the application during the launch didn't have the chance of hanging the device, it still would not be enough as all of the other reasons I mentioned would still be valid."
