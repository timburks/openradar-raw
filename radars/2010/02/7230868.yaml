    description: "NSString has -stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet: (added in 10.2) which always returns a new *immutable* string, regardless of whether the receiving string was mutable. Also, there is no equivalent method for NSMutableString to allow for modifying the same string. This is at odds with the presence of methods to append, insert, replace, and remove characters in a mutable string.\r\n\r\nSee http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1422369/ and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1774766/ for examples of how this bug can bite developers.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is a nuisance in any situation, and removing leading/trailing whitespace (or other character sets) is a great match for a mutable string operation."
