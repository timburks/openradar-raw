    description: "CGRectContainsPoint will return false if you provide it a point that is on the boundary of the CGRect.\r\n\r\nI understand that the strict definition of contains means that this function is performing as it should.\r\n\r\nHowever most developers (myself included at first) will expect these points to be considered 'contained' by the CGRect.\r\n\r\nTo save developers in the future a lot of time (and possibly obscure bugs). It would be great if we could get a little note on this function that reminds us that points on the CGRect boundary are not considered to be 'contained'.\r\n\r\nRelevant documentation is here: \r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000016-BBCIGACJ"
