    description: "On Snow Leopard, focus rings fail to draw if the destination context is not one that was handed to you by the view system for a -drawRect call.\r\n\r\nAttached is sample code [email me if you want it]. The green box on the left is drawn with a focus ring into a created context. The green box on the right is drawn with a focus ring directly into the context created by the view system.\r\n\r\nBoth green boxes should have focus rings. On Leopard, they both do. On Snow Leopard, the one on the left does not.\r\n\r\nWhy?"
