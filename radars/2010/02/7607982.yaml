    description: "My wife and I both have MobileMe accounts, both have iDisk Sync turned on (in the MobileMe preference pane, iDisk tab), and use fast user switching, so we're frequently logged in at the same time. On my account, my iDisk appears on the desktop (all the boxes are checked in the General tab of Finder preferences) as expected. However, when she is logged in but I'm the active user, her iDisk also appears, but with a folder icon and a red badge indicating that I don't have privileges to view it, like one would see when browsing another user's home folder. \r\n\r\nIt probably appears because it's mounted in /Volumes. For example, here's what I'd see from my wife's side:\r\n\r\nshayla$ ls -l /Volumes\r\ntotal 16\r\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root    admin    1 Jan 24 14:46 Snow Leopard -> /\r\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 shayla  admin   21 Feb  3 11:51 iDisk -> /Volumes/s***\r\ndrwx------  14 quinn   staff  850 Feb  3 11:01 q***\r\ndrwx------  13 shayla  staff  782 Feb  3 10:11 s***\r\n\r\nI've also included a picture of what it looks like, including clicking on the iDisk in the sidebar.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the component that would actually have to be changed to avoid this, but it would be nice if other users' iDisk sync volumes did not appear on my Desktop. (There must be a way to detect whether a volume is being used for iDisk syncing and keep it from appearing.) Perhaps there could be a Finder option to display only volumes I can access? At the very least, the icon could be more accurate, like an iDisk â€” my wife asked me why the heck I put a folder with my name on her desktop. :-)"
