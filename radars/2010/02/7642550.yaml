    description: "Summary: \r\nI want to provide free content that is treated just like paid in-app purchases, but iTunes Connect doesn't support this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In iTunes Connect, edit an in-app purchase.\r\n2. Try to set the price tier to free.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's possible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's not: the lowest available price tier is \"Tier 1.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nA developer can provide most of this functionality by duplicating infrastructure provided by iTunes Connect and StoreKit relating to localized names, descriptions, and prices.  Restoring such content is not possible, however, without requiring more information from the user, which makes for a worse user experience.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFrom a StoreKit perspective, this only requires that the -price method of a free SKProduct return [NSDecimalNumber zero].  I would also expect free \"purchases\" to be restorable and generate a verifiable receipt."
