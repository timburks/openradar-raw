    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHitting Cmd-Tab sometimes starts a auto-cycle through all the open apps without hitting the tab key again. The \"selected app\" blue box indicator just keeps cycling until I let got of the cmd key or hit escape. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Hit Cmd-Tab\r\n\r\n2. At random times this will trigger the auto-cycle, but it's not consistent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nStable \"previous\" app selection until additional Cmd-Tab's move to other apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nauto-cycle that is only broken by letting go of the Cmd key or hitting Escape. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis appears to be in all Snow Leopard versions, but became more prevalent since 10.6.1"
