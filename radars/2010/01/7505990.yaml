    description: "03-Jan-2010 10:23 PM Stephen Riehm:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOpening 2,000 windows on OS X results in memory corruption and an unstable environment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen Mail.app with at least one folder containing approx. 2000 emails.\r\nSelect all emails in a folder with cmd-A\r\nOpen the emails with a double click.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA pop-up window to ensure that the user really wants to open so many windows.\r\nIf the user does want to open them, then new windows should be created until the system reaches it's viable limit - at which point a second pop-up should appear to indicate that no more windows can be opened. (or the system should be able to handle an unlimited number of windows, as long as memory allows).\r\n\r\nA way to interrupt the creation of so many windows would also be good. For example, a floating bezelled button similar to the buttons that appear during an iPhoto slide-show, allowing the user to stop the creation of windows.\r\n\r\nSeeing Expos√© handle 2,000 windows would have been fun - but it never happened.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAt first a pop-up window telling the user that 2000 separate windows will be created and asking for confirmation.\r\nIf the user agrees to open that many windows (as I did), then windows appear in quick succession, progressively getting slower. After a while, the newly created windows appear corrupted, with their title bars appearing in the middle of the window, the graphics within each window being chopped up and garbled and finally, all new windows appear simply black.\r\n\r\nThere was no way to stop this process once it had begun and obviously OS-X (or Mail.app) went further than it reasonably could.\r\n\r\nNo error was reported and all other apps continued to run fine - performance and reaction times of OS-X were also more or less unaffected. Mail.app however didn't recover.\r\n\r\nNow the weird bit: when I opened the force-quit window with alt-cmd-esc, it too was corrupted beyond recognition!\r\n\r\nI managed to kill Mail.app and the windows all duly disappeared, however, from that point on my system was plagued with problems such as hanging apps etc. until such time as I rebooted.\r\n\r\nDue to the secondary problems encountered (corrupted new windows from other apps including the force-quit window and subsequent hanging apps), I expect that the OS-X window sub-system itself ran into memory problems rather than Mail.app having done something wrong.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI have not tried this with older versions of OS-X\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\nMac Pro (2007)\r\nOS-X 10.6.2 (Build 10C540)\r\n2 x 2.66GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon\r\n8GB RAM, 4TB Disk\r\nGraphics Cards:\r\n    Slot-1: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT, 512MB VRam, 23\" + 30\" Cinema Displays, 32 Bit Color.\r\n    Slot-4: NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT, 256MB VRam, 23\" Cinema Display, 32 Bit color."
