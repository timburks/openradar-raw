    description: "29-Jun-2008 02:41 AM Clarence Locke:\r\nSummary:  when an Aperture Export Plugin is set to export MASTER images and the propertiesForImageAtIndex: or propertiesWithoutThumbnailForImageAtIndex: methods are called from a thread other than the main thread, an exception is thrown.  Calling these methods from any thread when exporter VERSIONS does not exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Build and install the supplied export plugin into ~/Library/Application Support/Aperture/Plug-Ins\r\n2) Launch Aperture\r\n3) Select 1 image\r\n4) Perform Export | ApertureExportBug\r\n5) From the export plugin's export setup panel, click on the 'call propertiesForImageAtIndex:' button with the 'Call From Main Thread' checkbox set.  See that the image's property dictionary is output.\r\n6) Repeat with 'Call From Main Thread' checkbox cleared.  Again the image properties are output.\r\n7) Change from Version to Master export.\r\n8) Set the 'Call From Main Thread' checkbox and click the button.  Again the image properties are output.\r\n9) Clear the 'Call From Main Thread' checkbox and click the button.  See than an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nException in Aperture: *** -[RKOriginalVersion file]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1690aae0\r\nBacktrace:\r\n0x00071fea  (in Aperture)\r\n0x9677edb7: +[NSException exceptionWithName:reason:userInfo:] (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x96786342: -[NSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector:] (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x9678494c: ___forwarding___ (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x96784a12: _CF_forwarding_prep_0 (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x00579db2  (in Aperture)\r\n0x00572955  (in Aperture)\r\n0x96784a7d: __invoking___ (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x96784468: -[NSInvocation invoke] (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x96784538: -[NSInvocation invokeWithTarget:] (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x967849aa: ___forwarding___ (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x96784a12: _CF_forwarding_prep_0 (in CoreFoundation)\r\n0x12c0c712  (in ApertureExportBug)\r\n0x936dbf1d: -[NSThread main] (in Foundation)\r\n0x936dbac4: __NSThread__main__ (in Foundation)\r\n0x94dac6f5: _pthread_start (in libSystem.B.dylib)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  In all cases, I expect to obtain valid image properties without an exception being thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n'getPropertiesForImageAtIndex_bug.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Jun-2008 08:21 AM Clarence Locke:\r\nThe attached zip file contains a complete Xcode project for an Aperture Export plugin that demonstrates this bug.\r\n\r\n29-Jun-2008 02:31 PM Clarence Locke:\r\nAperture 1.5.6 does not exhibit this behavior â€” it works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n22-Mar-2010 Clarence Locke:\r\nAperture 3.x does not exhibit this behavior."
