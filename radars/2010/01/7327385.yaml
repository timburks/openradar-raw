    description: "22-Oct-2009 01:47 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nOn 10.6.1, using cmd-C to copy a frame from a video with a graphicsModePreBlackAlpha video track over a video no longer works; instead of getting what's shown in the player window, it shows the transparent track over a white background.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Move attached Perian.component to ~/Library/QuickTime/.\r\n2. Open attached 2tracks.mkv in QuickTime Player 7.\r\n3. Hit cmd-C.\r\n4. Open Preview.\r\n5. Hit cmd-N.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe text \"Subtitle track 2\" over the first frame of the video.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe text \"Subtitle track 2\" over a white background. There is a single black pixel in the upper-left, which doesn't appear in any of the original video tracks.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorked in 10.5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame file as radr://7327287."
