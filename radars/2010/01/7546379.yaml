    description: "Summary: any edits that result in text spanning fewer pages can result in the apparent \"loss\" of a floating graphic on the last page.  This may have to do with the philosophic distinction between \"word processing\" and \"page layout\" documents but this behavior seems wrong for a \"word processing\" document.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(1) open new blank \"word processing\" document\r\n(2) insert a page break\r\n(2) insert a floating shape on the second page\r\n(4) delete page break\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing mysteriously disappears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou now have a one page document with the shape gone (floating off in limbo somewhere).  First of all this can cause user panic (\"OMG what happened to the diagram I just spent the last hour making?!\") especially if the lost graphic is not noticed until well after the edit that caused the change in pagination.  Secondly, in what sense is it correct to treat a document with text on one page and a graphic on the second as a single page document?\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would expect this to result in a two page document.  If not there really ought to be some way to see (in the thumbnail or when scrolled down to the bottom of the document) that there are floating objects in \"limbo\"."
