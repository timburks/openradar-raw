In Workgroup Manager, set a user's password policy so that they must change their password upon next login.\r\n2. Access the PasswordReset web app (i.e. https://server.example.com/changepassword/).\r\n3. Attempt to log in as the user in step 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should be allowed into the web app in order to change their password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe authentication dialog shook side to side and disallowed the login.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs in all versions Mac OS X Server 10.6 and higher.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone."
