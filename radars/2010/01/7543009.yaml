    description: "A few times per day I experience that some of the icons in Finder are blank, see the attached screenshot. I haven't seen it in other Snow Leopard setups. No other programs are exhibiting this behavior. I guess Finder has an icon cache that sporadically returns NULL. \r\n\r\nOne way that is almost certain to trigger this is if I visit iusethis.com and download a program I never have installed on my computer before. When I mounts the DMG I under normal circumstances see the icon of whats contained inside the DMG, but now in most cases there are no icons visible. Dragging out the application from the DMG into the Applications folder, leaves the applications with a blank icon.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly sure that I can repeat it if I get a DMG file with an application inside."
