    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no link that takes me a list to all documents of a single type within a given documentation set. I can go to a single Guide, a Reference, or a single Release Notes document, or to a list of *all* documentation in a documentation set (all Guides, all References, all Release Notes, etc., all together), but not only all Guides or only all References or only all Release Notes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to the Mac Reference Library (http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/navigation/) or the iPhone Reference Library (http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/navigation/).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe “Guides”, “References”, and “Release Notes” items in the list on the left side are links, each of which goes to a page that will list only Guides, only References, or only Release Notes documents.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such links exist. The items in the list are JavaScript hot buttons; there is no way to link to the subset lists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes. The old documentations site had separate pages for Guides, for References, and for Release Notes documents, making it easy to link to the separate lists of each.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's difficult for a new Cocoa or Cocoa Touch programmer to explore the APIs when they're buried in a soup of documents of varying types. The first stop every such programmer should make is to the list of Guides, but there is currently no one-click, bookmarkable way to get there.\r\n\r\nEvery Cocoa or Cocoa Touch programmer should check the chronologically-sorted list of Release Notes documents periodically to see what's new and changed, but there is currently no bookmarkable way to get a list of all of the Release Notes documents.\r\n\r\nWhen Apple releases a new version of one OS or the other, sometimes they add new frameworks, which come with new framework references. There is currently no one-click, bookmarkable way to get a list of these.\r\n\r\n[Closure message]\r\nThis support is provided -- clicking one of the links in the TOC changes the URL in the browser to a bookmarkable URL with that setting, such as this to see all the Guides:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/mac/library/navigation/index.html#section=Resource%20Types&topic=Guides\r\n\r\n[My response]\r\n> … clicking one of the links in the TOC …\r\n\r\nThere aren't any links in the TOC. There are only list items with on-click handlers. If they were links, I could right-click on them and choose “Copy Link to Clipboard”, but since they aren't links, I can't.\r\n\r\n> … changes the URL in the browser to a bookmarkable URL with that setting, such as this to see all the Guides:\r\n> \r\n> http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/navigation/index.html#section=Resource%20Types&topic=Guides\r\n\r\nAh, OK. That should work."
