    description: "Summary:\r\nPressing Return or Enter in Instruments' “Choose Executable” dialog will simply close the dialog, instead of pressing the Choose button (the default button).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Instruments, create a new document. I used the Time Profiler template.\r\n2. From the Default Target toolbar item's “Launch Executable” submenu, choose “Choose Executable”.\r\n3. In the source list, select Volumes.\r\n4. Select a volume using the mouse, then use the arrow keys to drill down to a single application.\r\n5. Press Return or Enter to press the Choose button in order to choose the application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Return or Enter key-press presses the default button, which is Choose. Thus, the user chooses the application. The dialog goes away and the selection in the toolbar item is now the application that was selected in the dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Return or Enter key-press appears to press no button. The dialog goes away anyway, and the selection in the toolbar item is unchanged.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot that I know of.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor one thing, why is this dialog box not a sheet on the document window?\r\n\r\nFor another, why is it a separate dialog box and not a stock NSOpenPanel with an accessory view?\r\n\r\nThere are many ways the current “Choose Target” dialog box is broken, most of which I haven't yet figured out STR for. NSOpenPanel suffers from none of them. Why not use what already works?\r\n\r\nI've recorded video: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PitfXhuo_tY"
