    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running ibtool to apply incremental changes to our localized xibs, some strings are being stomped on. For example, we ran ibtool to apply a change from our en xib to our pt-PT xib. The change had nothing to do with strings, but was merely a move of an element. When we ran the ibtool command, everything in the pt-PT xib was correct, except the headers of the NSTableView were in English instead of Portuguese. Thus, ibtool is not preserving the NSContents of the NSHeaderCell for NSTableView in the incremental-file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attached is a simplified version of the environment to reproduce this bug. Unzip the attachment.\r\n2. Run this ibtool command (derived from http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/IB_UserGuide/LocalizingNibFiles/LocalizingNibFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005344-CH13-SW8) in the unzipped folder:\r\n\r\nibtool --previous-file ./old/en.lproj/HouseGreeting.xib --incremental-file ./old/pt-PT.lproj/HouseGreeting.xib --localize-incremental --write ./new/pt-PT.lproj/HouseGreeting.xib ./new/en.lproj/HouseGreeting.xib\r\n\r\n3. Open ./new/pt-PT.lproj/HouseGreeting.xib and note that localized NSTextFields have been preserved in Portuguese, but the headers of the NSTableView are in English now.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nHeaders of the NSTableView are in Portuguese in ./new/pt-PT.lproj/HouseGreeting.xib\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHeaders of the NSTableView are in English in ./new/pt-PT.lproj/HouseGreeting.xib\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI was able to reproduce this bug on Mac OS X 10.5 running Developer Tools 3.1.x."
