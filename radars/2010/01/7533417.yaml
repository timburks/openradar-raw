    description: "12-Jan-2010 05:28 PM Emanuele Vulcano:\r\nSummary:\r\npasteboardWithName:create: does not return a UIPasteboard if its second parameter is NO; instead, it returns nil. The documentation says it should return nil only if the pasteboard does not exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In one application, create a pasteboard (for example, with -[UIPasteboard pasteboardWithUniqueName]) and make sure to make it persistent. Pass its name to another application.\r\n\r\n2. In that application, given NSString* theName the name of the other pasteboard, execute the following:\r\n\r\nUIPasteboard* pb = [UIPasteboard pasteboardWithName:theName create:NO];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\"pb\" points to a UIPasteboard with the same contents as the one produced by the first application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\"pb\" is nil."
