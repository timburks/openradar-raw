    description: "19-Jan-2010 09:16 AM Eric Vitiello:\r\nDisabling MobileSafari on the iPhone/iPod Touch is the only control available for parental control of MobileSafari.  I would be helpful if MobileSafari (or more importantly the device as a whole) had a whitelist of acceptable sites, such that when the device is in parental control mode:\r\n\r\n1. The user of the device attempts to visit a site not in the white list\r\n2. The parent is notified via push messaging, and is given the option to:\r\n   1. Deny the request\r\n   2. Approve the request\r\n   3. View the site in question (and then approve/deny)\r\n\r\nThus allowing a smooth workflow for parental controls via two devices."
