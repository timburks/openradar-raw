    description: "Summary\r\n======================\r\nWhen dragging an unselected file from a Finder window in list view, the file being dragged is not initial visually apparent.  This is especially ambiguous when the current selection set is non-empty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce\r\n======================\r\n1) Open a Finder window in list view.  Ensure that the contents of the folder has more than one item.\r\n\r\n2) Select one item in the list by single-clicking.  Observe the selection change (on mouse _up_).\r\n\r\n3) Initiate a drag operation on an unselected item in the list by performing a mouse down on the item.  Before moving the mouse, observe that there is no visual indication that an item different than the current selection is about to be operated on.\r\n\r\n4) Continue the drag operation.  Observe that an partially transparent icon representation of the selection moves with your mouse.\r\n\r\n5) Now repeat steps 3) and 4) in a more \"human time\" fluid motion.  It is visually ambiguous that the item you grabbed is _not_ the highlighted item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\n======================\r\nWhen a mouse down operation on an item in the Finder list view occurs, there should be some visual feedback to indicate which object is about to be operated on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\n======================\r\nNo visual cue occurs until the mouse is moved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression\r\n======================\r\nPerforming the same steps on Leopard has the selection change on mouse down.\r\n\r\n\r\n'SnowLeopardFinderListDrag.mov.zip' was successfully uploaded"
