    description: "iPhoto can take many seconds to show a best-quality image, and in the interim it shows a lower quality (fuzzier) image. When working with high-quality photos (I use 2-5.5mbyte 15mpixel photos), the delay is long. As a result, there is an indeterminate time during which a fuzzy image might be due to a poor photo, or simply because iPhoto hasn't shown me the best image it can yet.\r\n\r\niPhoto needs an indication of whether it's still working on rendering the current image(s). It can be subtle, but we need *something*."
