    description: "Regardless of parental control ratings, 17+ rated apps show up when casually browsing the app store.  Unlike music and movies, these apps typically have icons, names and screenshots that border on obscene just by themselves.  It's gotten so bad that it's actually not possible to allow a typical young child to browse the app store by themselves without them being assaulted by various boob/softcore porn apps.\r\n\r\nThe apps that are clearly \"adult in nature\" should either be forced into a separate \"Red Light District\" category, or they should be hidden when parental controls are enabled.\r\n\r\nI specify \"Adult in nature\" here because clearly, apps that simply allow internet access (for example Twitter clients) should NOT be placed into this \"Red Light District\".  This is plain common sense here.  What we're talking about is apps like \"Abnormally Big Boobs\" and \"Asian Schoolgirls\" and so on.\r\n\r\nThe point here is to stop the polluting of categories like Lifestyle, Entertainment, etc with these apps that clearly don't belong there.\r\n\r\nOf the solutions proposed above, I feel a \"Red Light District\" category as well as the ability to restrict access to it would be ideal."
