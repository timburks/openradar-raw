    description: "03-Jan-2010 10:41 PM Stephen Riehm:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen updating an OS-X file-system alias to point to a new target, the file-browser sheet always starts at /Applications.\r\nThe file browser should open in the directory containing the current target, if possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a directory structure (in my case: ~/Documents/Correspondence/Yearly Archive/2009/...).\r\nCreate an alias to one of the directories in your directory structure. (ie: Current Correspondence -> .../2009)\r\nOpen the alias' Info via cmd-I.\r\nClick on the \"Select New Original\" button in the info window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe file browser which appears should open the folder containing the current target of the alias.\r\nIf this is not possible, I would expect to see the user's home directory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe file browser opens with /Applications pre-selected.\r\nAn option to jump to the directory containing the current target of the alias is not available.\r\nThe current target of an alias is presented in the Info pane, as \"Original:\", but it is not possible to set the file browser to open in that location. To add insult to injury, this information is then obscured by the file browser sheet which opens when you click on \"Select New Original\".\r\n\r\nIn my view, /Applications is an edge case and very easy to find. The current target of an alias could point anywhere and could be infinitely obscure to locate.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn my case I wanted to create a new correspondence directory for 2010.\r\nMy expectation was  to simply open the existing alias, use the file browser to create a new 2010 directory and set it as the new target of the alias."
