    description: "22-Jan-2010 12:30 PM Richard Glaser:\r\nWe want to use Screen Sharing in our Mac classrooms to allow students remotely observe the instructors stations.\r\n\r\nWe were planning creating web internet location doc's that used vnc://[instructors IP] on all the students classroom Mac's, but we can't get observe only to work.\r\n\r\nWe have following options with System Preferences -> Sharing -> Remote Management and have the \"Control\" option deselected\r\n\r\nWhen connecting from a Mac OS X 10.6 client with the \"Control\" deselected, it displays dialog in the background, which you have to click on the Screen Sharing dialog to display. Shouldn't this automatically display in front and not require clicking on the connection dialog?\r\n\r\nOnce you click Ok, it crashes. The Screen Sharing app is version 1.1.1\r\n\r\nAttached the crash to this bugreport. It is called \"Mac OS X 10.6.2 (10C540) - Screen Sharing Crash.txt\"\r\n\r\nWhen connecting from a Mac OS X 10.5 client with the \"Control\" deselected. It keeps trying to connect for several minutes and then you must click on the \"Screen Sharing\" icon in the Dock for it to display the same dialog and then Screen Sharing application crashes. Shouldn't this automatically display in front and not require clicking on the Screen Sharing application icon in the Dock?\r\n\r\nThe Screen Sharing app is version 1.0.3\r\n\r\nAttached the crash to this bugreport. It is called \"Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L31a) - Screen Sharing Crash.txt\""
