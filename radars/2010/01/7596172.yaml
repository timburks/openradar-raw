    description: "Summary: \r\nIn some situations, there's a need to undo the mistakes that we made in \"Manage App ID\" section of iPhone Developer Program portal\r\n\r\nThis is important because developers at some point need to create a suite of App IDs for testing purpose or development purpose. While using different IDs for production purpose or release.\r\n\r\nEspecially when we want to test Push Notification or maybe In-App purchase.\r\n\r\nThis process is prone to typos or mistakes, so the ability to modify the existing App ID on the iPhone Developer Program Portal is necessary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an App ID.\r\n2. Create the Bundle Seed ID and Bundle ID\r\n3. Done.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDevelopers should be able to remove or modify existing App IDs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe App ID is not modifiable."
