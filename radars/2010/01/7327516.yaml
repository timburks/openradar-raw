    description: "Summary:\r\nExporting the attached file (with a transparent video track using graphicsModePreBlackAlpha) using \"Export for Web\" in QT Player 7 or any export method in QT Player 10 fails - the resulting files only show the transparent video track over a black background.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Move attached Perian.component to ~/Library/QuickTime/.\r\n2. Open attached '2tracks.mkv' in QT Player 7.\r\n3. Export to a Desktop movie using 'Export for Web'.\r\n4. Open the resulting file.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe text \"Subtitle track 2\" over the first frame of the video.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe text \"Subtitle track 2\" over a black background.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nExport for Web worked under 10.5. (I'll check that one again, though.)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame file as radr://7327385 and nearly the same problem, though it's probably a different cause this time.\r\n\r\nNearly the same problem as radr://5563623. (note that you won't be able to reproduce that bug with the component attached here, since it has a workaround hack in place)"
