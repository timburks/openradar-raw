    description: "25-Feb-2009 12:38 PM Eric Vitiello:\r\nThe enhanced Web Inspector in Safari 4 is excellent, but could use some additional features to put it on par with FireBug:\r\n\r\n1. Cookie Inspector for current website\r\n2. Request & Response Header Inspector (ideally with support for things like FirePHP)"
