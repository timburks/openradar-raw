    description: "26-Jan-2010 09:01 PM Todd Ditchendorf:\r\n'WorkflowTest.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n26-Jan-2010 09:01 PM Todd Ditchendorf:\r\nSummary: \r\n----------------\r\nDragging an Action from either the Finder or from Automator.app to an AMWorkflowView does not have desired effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-----------------\r\n1. build/Run attached sample project (simple window with an AMWorkflowView).\r\n2. note that the AMWorkflowView invites you to drag an Action onto it.\r\n3. drag an Automator action from either the Finder or Automator.app onto the window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n----------------\r\nAction should be added to the workflow\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n----------------\r\nWhen dragged from Automator.app, nothing happens. When dragged from the Finder a \"Get Specified Finder Items\" Action is added instead of the one you dragged (with the path to the Action you dragged pre-populated)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-----------------\r\nI also saw the same behavior when testing on 10.5.8. Dunno if this ever worked.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-----------------\r\nMaybe i missed something in the setup of the AMWorkflowView. If not, this seems like a serious issue that would prevent AMWorkflow from being usable."
