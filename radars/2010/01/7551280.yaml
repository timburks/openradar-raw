    description: "Summary: \r\nRandom screen flickers occurring on iMac 27\" (Radeon HD 4850, Core i7) with screen blackouts. PRAM reset, SMC reset and Firmware Update didn't solve it. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nKeep the machine running, comes faster if put to sleep instead of turning it of when not used for a longer period. There are no real steps as such to reproduce the error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results. No flickering.\r\n\r\nActual results: flickering, blackouts. The flickering is visible as bars of noise running at certain, limited areas across the screen (bars of noise). Before the Radeon update these bars have been mainly black. After the update these bars contain noise. Similar to what you can sometimes see when switching windows in Safari on low performance hardware like the MacBook Air.\r\n\r\nRegression: The problem occurs more frequently when the iMac runs for longer period of time (real uptime > 12 hours) and is only put to sleep when not used for longer period ( at night). CPU load, chip temperatures etc. seem to have no effect. I can run a 3D game in Parallels window mode and have the fan running most of the time without flickering. I also tried different power setups, so same wall outlet as other hardware or a single outlet for the iMac to no real avail.\r\n\r\nNotes: The user and apps where migrated from a TM backup, while the OS installation was the original one as it came from the factory."
