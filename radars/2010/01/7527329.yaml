    description: I used to be able to type a partial URL such as "google/maps" into Safari's Location bar, hit Return, and have it intelligently fill it out to <http://www.google.com/maps>. This no longer works -- now I additionally have to type '.com' in the domain. I am not using OpenDNS or something else that captures traffic, so this appears to be a Safari regression.
