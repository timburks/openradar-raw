    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, the only way to lock or unlock one's nibs for localizers to safely handle is to do so one nib at a time using the IB GUI. This makes life difficult for projects with many nibs, which may be multiplied by many languages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to use ibtool or AppleScript to set the locking mode of every nib in a directory hierarchy.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nibtool can set the locking mode. If it can't, IB exposes it as a property of the document object that I can set from an AppleScript script.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeither ibtool nor IB via AppleScript can set the locking mode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot that I'm aware.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNon-localization changes from over-aggressive non-technically-inclined localizers are a certainty if we cannot easily lock every nib before putting them up for localization and unlock them after localization.\r\n\r\nThe fix (preferably, an option to ibtool) should provide all of the same locking modes as the IB GUI, as listed in the IB User Guide: http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/IB_UserGuide/LocalizingNibFiles/LocalizingNibFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005344-CH13-SW4"
