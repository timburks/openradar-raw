    description: "20-Aug-2009 11:45 AM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen deleting files with the same name, they are renamed in the Trash. When you put back a deleted file whose name has been changed, it should change the name back to the original, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Empty the trash.\r\n2. Make new folders \"dir 1\" and \"dir 2\".\r\n3. Inside both folders, make a new folder named \"a\".\r\n4. Delete both \"a\" folders.\r\n5. Put back both folders.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe directory structure should be the same as it was after step 3.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nOne \"a\" folder will have been renamed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn step 4, if you select both \"a\" folders at the same time and open the contextual menu for them, there won't be a \"put back\" option for both of them at once. But in other situations, you do seem to be able to put back multiple things. I don't see why.\r\n\r\nI actually ran into this when I deleted several Xcode build directories then realized I wanted them after all."
