On a German keyboard they are located right next to \"P\" and \"L\", as you probably know.\r\nHowever, on the iPad with all the new screen real estate it brings with it, you failed to add those rather important keys to the layout.\r\n\r\nI consider it inacceptable for a German user to have to resort to such solutions like on the iPhone, i.e. tapping and holding \"A\" to get to \"Ä\". Now that you offer such a big on screen keyboard, you should definitely offer the correct layout, at least as a users choice.\r\n\r\nSee attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: Attachment was: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1041539/Screenshot%202010-01-28%2019h%2044m%2029s.png"
