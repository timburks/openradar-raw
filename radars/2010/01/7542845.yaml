    description: "Summary:\r\nOn my Apple Studio Display 17\" LCD (white, tripod, ADC, shiny Apple logo), Snow Leopard renders pure blue from the Generic RGB color space as a purplish color (a little under 1/3 red, in addition to 1/1 blue).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be using a 17\" LCD Apple Studio Display.\r\n2. Be using the profile for this display that came with Snow Leopard.\r\n3. Display pure blue (#00f) in the Generic RGB color space on this display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe color appears pure blue, or something close to it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe color appears purple.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes. Leopard did not have this problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have compiled copious evidence:\r\n\r\n- Screenshot of menu selections: http://boredzo.org/screenshots/SnowLeopard-PurpleIsTheNewBlue-MenuSelections.png\r\n- Screenshot of an app in the App Store: http://boredzo.org/screenshots/SnowLeopard-PurpleIsTheNewBlue-RippedOffIconIniPhoneAppIniTunesStore.png\r\n  - The icon itself is that of CandyBar, by Panic Software. I hope they've alerted you to the trademark/copyright infringement. The difference is most visible (in my configuration, at least) between the background of the application icon and the background of the screenshot. The difference is also visible in the filling of the candy bar, although it's hard to notice because even the correctly-displayed icon has purple highlights.\r\n- Screenshot of Deus Ex, running in CrossOver Games: http://boredzo.org/screenshots/SnowLeopard-PurpleIsTheNewBlue-DeusEx.png\r\n  - Called out are a NanoKey (1), the Dragon's Tooth sword in belt slot #1 (2), and the stack of bioelectric cells in belt slot #9 (3). All three should be shades of pure blue. The Dragon's Tooth (2) is the most obvious error.\r\n- Video showing the difference between pure blue in Generic RGB converted (erroneously) to the display's \r\ncolor space and pure blue created within the display's color space: http://youtube.com/watch?v=acYr4Niyt-E\r\n  - My converting the video to H.264 really brought out the color difference (probably by “correcting” the colors a second time), so if anything makes the bug obvious, this will.\r\n\r\nThis bug is related to, if not an outright duplicate of, x-radar://problem/7285816."
