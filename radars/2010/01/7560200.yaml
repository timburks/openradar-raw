    description: "### Summary\r\n\r\nWith parental controls enabled, iTunes still allows users to view the icons, descriptions and screenshots of applications that fall outside of the current age restriction.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Lanuch iTunes\r\n2. In the Parental tab of preferences, select \"4+\" form the \"Applications to\" popup.\r\n3. Lock the dialog with the padlock.\r\n4. OK\r\n5. Select iTunes store in sidebar, navigate to Lifestyle section of App Store.\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nExpected that only applications rated 4+ would be visible.\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\n\r\nApplications of all age ratings are viewable, along with app details and screenshots, some of which are quite explicit:\r\n\r\n- \"Peekababe Lite\"\r\n- \"Sexy Girls Uncovered\"\r\n- \"A Hidden Cam Thong\"\r\n- \"Brainy Teen\"\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nI'm planning to deploy 120 iPod touches to the school I work in. As it stands, I cannot give the students access to the iTunes store, even just to browse.\r\n\r\nPlease consider hiding applications that fall outside the age restrictions. In the current setup the App Store contains content that would be a serioous disciplinary matter if we found any student browsing similar images on the open web.\r\n\r\nAn archive of screenshots of iTunes with a 4+ rating restriction in place is attached. (OpenRadar people can find their own porn)."
