    description: "[Summary]\r\nAfter a first time confirmation to send a crash report to Apple, the 'Send Dialog' is missing a 'Cancel' Button in every subsequent Crash Report dialog box, thus making it impossible to not send a crash report.\r\n\r\n[Steps to Reproduce]\r\nCrash an App, Crash Reporter becomes active, send the Crash Report, Provoke another Crash: the dialog is missing the 'Cancel' button.\r\n\r\n[Expected Results] \r\nSince I cannot see any advantage in sending my development crashes, I really want my Cancel button back! \r\n\r\n[Regression]\r\nDifferent behaviour in Mac OS X 10.5"
