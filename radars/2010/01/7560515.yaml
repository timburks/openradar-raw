    description: "Summary: \r\nOpenCL's performance is greatly diminished at certain image sizes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetting the image width and height parameters in clCreateImage2D to prime numbers. E.g. an image size of 811 x 647 drastically reduces performance. The problem appears to be greatest where the product of the width and height has a limited number of divisors (hence prime numbers providing the worst case scenarios).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWith my sample application an image may be rendered in approximately 0.3 to 0.4 seconds. E.g. with an image size of 805 x 650\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn the worst case, the time to render an image may decrease to around 9 seconds (e.g. for an image of size 811 x 647)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem seems to be present on any graphics card I have tested. The numbers quoted are on a GeForce 9600M GT, but I have seen the problem on other MacBook Pro cards. I do not, however, see this problem when running OpenCL directly on the CPU."
