    description: "18-Apr-2006 11:30 AM Karl Kuehn:\r\nSummary: \r\n\tWhen using the \"send unix command\" through AppleRemoteDesktop to a computer with either ARD 2 or 3 there is a limit to the size of the script you can send. Anything longer than that limit hangs the ARD client on the remote computer, and requires that ARD be restarted on it (usually through a reboot).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\tChoose an ARD client that has already been setup.\r\n\t\"Send UNIX Command\" with a bunch of comment lines with gibberish on them (the important thing is the number of characters)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\n\tThe command should send to the client (even if it takes a while), and run.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\n\tARD shows the command as \"sending\" and will continue to do so indefinitely. If you stop the send the ARD admin app can continue to function normally, but that client now needs to have the ARD agent restarted (through a reboot for instance) as it is hung.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\n\tHappens both in version 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\tRight now I am working around this by wrapping things in .pkg's, but I am not happy with that.\r\n\r\n25-Apr-2006 06:03 AM Karl Kuehn:\r\nHere is a trivial script, as I said in the notes all you need is a certain number of characters (one less line and it works). Also, this is not a pathological case as I do encode data for inclusion in scripts (for example to push users and groups out):\r\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
