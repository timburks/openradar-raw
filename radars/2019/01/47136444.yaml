    description: "Summary:\r\nHitting cmd-space and looking up an application name (e.g. \"Safari\") I constantly see the search window of Spotlight showing \"afari\" only and the \"S\" was dropped.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- as you would type any text/character sequence in a normal text field, type \"cmd-space\", \"Safari\" without visually waiting for the Spotlight search bar to appear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- all of my \"Safari\" text input should appear in Spotlight search bar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- the \"S\" is dropped and only \"afari\" appears\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is super frustrating to not being able to continue typing in the usual typing speed after hitting cmd-Space to invoke Spotlight search bar - a significant blocker.\n\nThis happens on Mojave and it already happened on High Sierra as well and I thought it was due to my previously slow MacBook but I now have the most recent MacBook Pro.\n\nFun fact is that this worked better in older incarnations of macOS and got worse in recent years."
