    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a UIKeyCommand with a discoverabilityTitle and input=UIKeyInputEscape this is shown in the keyboard shortcut HUD as being invoked with \"Esc\"\n\nMost keyboards used on iPad have no physical escape key and require the user to hold down Cmd and press . to get the equivalent of escape. \n\nMany users are unaware of this and it would be much better if UIKit could determine if the connected keyboard had a physical escape key or not and automatically show the invocation as \"⌘ .\" when there is no physical escape key.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a external keyboard without a escape key to iPad\n2. Open the Maps app\n3. Tap \"Search for place or address\" field to start searching.\n4. Hold down ⌘ until the shortcuts HUD is shown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"End Search\" should display the shortcut \"⌘ .\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"End Search\" displays the shortcut \"esc\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
