    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation of the velocity parameter of -[UISpringTimingParameters initWithDampingRatio:initialVelocity:] states “specified as a unit vector”.\n\nA unit vector is “a vector which has a magnitude of one” (from the Mac Dictionary).\n\nHowever, the rest of the description makes it clear this does not need to be a unit vector, such as by saying “specify a vector with a magnitude of 0.5”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead the documentation at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uispringtimingparameters/1649832-initwithdampingratio?language=objc\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould not state the vector should be a unit vector.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStates “specified as a unit vector”.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2019-01-29\r\n\r\nNotes:"
