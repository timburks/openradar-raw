    description: "Area:\r\nVision.framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhile running an iOS app on current iOS (12.1.2) + iPhone XS, these errors (below) are sent to Xcode logs. The App uses Vision with ARKit. The purpose is to use Vision's VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest along with ARKit's features.\r\n\r\nNote: the error doesn't seem to occur on my iPhone 7, but always occurs on my iPhone XS.\r\n\r\nThese errors always occur:\r\n> 2019-01-04 03:03:03.155867-0800 ARKit Vision Demo[12969:3307770] Execution of the command buffer was aborted due to an error during execution. Caused GPU Timeout Error (IOAF code 2)\r\n> 2019-01-04 03:03:03.155786-0800 ARKit Vision Demo[12969:3307850] Execution of the command buffer was aborted due to an error during execution. Discarded (victim of GPU error/recovery) (IOAF code 5)\r\n\r\nSometimes this error shows up:\r\n> [SceneKit] Error: display link thread seems stuck\r\n\r\nThis prototype/concept code is based on the guide https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/using_vision_in_real_time_with_arkit\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nApp is on Github https://github.com/xta/ARKit-Vision-Demo (App also attached as Xcode project ZIP)\r\n\r\n* Run app on actual hardware, specifically iPhone XS. \r\n* Allow camera permissions for AR app\r\n* Point phone's camera at faces (or image of faces)\r\n* App hangs/crashes/errors\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app uses Vision to detect face rectangles in the camera's image. Or at a minimum, the app doesn't freeze/hang/crash/error when a face is detected by Vision.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhile using the app & looking around the user's environment with the camera, the app freezes/hangs/errors often. Either just looking around or looking at a JPG (on computer screen) of a face, the app will hang/freeze/crash error.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n1.0/Alpha\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nlatest Xcode 10.1, latest iOS 12.1.2, iPhone XS"
