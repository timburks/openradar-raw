    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a setup where we dynamically allow the UITextField to change its font’s point size. \n\nIn the case that somehow a UIFont with pointSize 0 is assigned to a UITextField’s font property, the UITextField completely breaks: its cursor becomes a “dot”, and typing will make the control appear that it’s behaving erratically.\n\nIt appears that setting a UIFont with pointSize 0 is undefined for UITextField. I think in these cases, there should be a warning about this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Instantiate a UITextField\n2. Set its font property to a UIFont object with pointSize 0\n3. Try to interact with the text field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere’s either a warning indicating that the text field’s behavior with a font of size 0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo warning is issued and the text field behaves erratically when interacting with it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
