    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter an MKAnnotationView has been created & displayed, then updating its image to one with a different horizontal size than the original image does not modify the x-position of the callout bubble. In other words, updating to a larger image in `mapView(_:didSelect:)` will present the callout at the correct y-position (at the top of the grown annotation view), but the x-position will fall short of the center. A workaround to this would be to modify the `calloutOffset` to the difference in distance between the old & new image centerX. This is obviously not preferred as a `calloutOffset` of `CGPoint.zero` should imply that the callout is horizontally centered above the annotation view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an MKMapView with a list of annotations, each with a non-nil `title`\r\n2. Within the delegate implementor, ensure that each `MKAnnotationView` has:\r\n- `canShowCallout` set to `true`\r\n- `image` set to a provided `UIImage`\r\n3. Within `mapView(_:didSelect:)`, update the annotation view with a horizontally larger `UIImage` than the original\r\n4. Within `mapView(_:didDeselect:)`, update the annotation view with the original image\r\n5. Run the project and tap on any annotation view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCallout bubble animates in (or not) to the correct position above the annotation view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCallout bubble animates in to the correct y-position, but at the incorrect x-position of originalImage.width/2\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1.2, Xcode 10.1, Swift 4.2"
