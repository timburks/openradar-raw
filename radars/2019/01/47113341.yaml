    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing named colors in an asset catalog causes the IBDesignables agent to crash and leave IB in an unusable state if you attempt to access and force-unwrap those colors in `prepareForInterfaceBuilder`. \r\n\r\nIf your asset catalog is in the `main` bundle, passing `Bundle.main` is still not sufficient, you have to pass something like `Bundle(for: AppDelegate.self)` (or some other class in the main bundle) for the agent to stop crashing. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add named colors to Asset Catalog in main bundle\r\n2. Attempt to access said colors in `prepareForInterfaceBuilder` without specifying bundle\r\n3. IBDesignables agent crashes, IB turns into Big Pile Of Boxes Of Sadness\r\n4. Attempt to use main bundle\r\n5. Pile of Boxes of Sadness Remains\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNamed colors in the asset catalog can be referenced from `IBDesignable` without having to pass in a bundle if they’re in the main bundle. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashola.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAgain, this *can* be worked around by passing in `Bundle(for: AppDelegate.self)` but that’s really not obvious at all. See `Color.swift` for the 3 options I tried and how they worked.\r\n\r\nThis is all only something you can figure out if you dive through crash reports in Console. There is no indication of where the issue is directly within Xcode when the IBDesignables agent crashes."
