    description: "Area:\r\nVision.framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen running a VNTrackRectangleRequest on a VNRectangleObservation that has been manually created (using one of the provided initializers), the VNRectangleObservation output from the tracking request has an incorrect bounding box.\r\n\r\nI've attached a slightly modified version of the sample code TrackingMultipleObjectsOrRectanglesInVideo, found here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/tracking_multiple_objects_or_rectangles_in_video\r\n\r\nMy changes can be found on line 68 of VisionTrackerProcessor.swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a rectangle observation: VNRectangleObservation(boundingBox: myCustomBoundingBox)\r\nCreating a VNTrackRectangleRequest with the rectangle observation\r\nObserve the bounding box property of the VNRectangleObservation output when the tracking request has completed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tracking request is able to accurately track a given rectangle across several frame.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tracking request outputs an incorrect bounding box, and therefore is not able to track the next frame with that previous output.\r\n\r\nHere is the debugger output of a rectangle observation before being fed into a tracking request, and then the rectangle observation that is returned as the output of that tracking request:\r\n\r\n<VNRectangleObservation: 0x280ca55f0> 08D44526-469F-4CA0-929D-6C69ABC29180, revision 1, 1.000000 [0.308167 0.377704 0.375584 0.215798]\r\n\r\n<VNRectangleObservation: 0x280ca4b40> 08D44526-469F-4CA0-929D-6C69ABC29180, revision 1, 1.000000 [0.0125 0.0125 0 0]\r\n\r\nYou can see that the UUID is the same, but the bounding box changes to a completely incorrect [0.0125 0.0125 0 0].\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 10.1 (10B61)\r\nDeployment Target 12.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7\r\niOS 12.1.2 (16C104)"
