    description: "Summary:\r\n`pbcopy` fails at a pretty significant rate, making the clipboard unusable. From the terminal fails about 10-20% of the time in the trivial case of copying plain text content. It seems to fail like 30-40% of the time when using CMD+C to copy lines of code in Xcode, making it very difficult to use the machine productively. Looking at the contents of the Clipboard in Finder indicates that there is nothing on the Clipboard when this happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the following command in a Terminal many times: \r\n\r\n> echo foo | pbcopy && pbpaste\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe output `foo` should appear consistently in the Terminal each time the command is run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`foo` is output is displayed sometimes, but sometimes nothing appears.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nMacOS Mojave 10.14.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)\r\nFull system info dump attached"
