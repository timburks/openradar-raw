    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSetting location in the simulator from the debug menu works intermittently for the location options that move.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWith an app running in the simulator, switch location between Apple and Freeway Drive several times.  It may take a few runs of the app before it happens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe blue dot showing the user's location should move to the appropriate location and in the case of Freeway Drive it should start moving along the set path.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt works a few times, then setting Freeway Drive results in the blue dot turning grey and no movement is observed.  Some combination of restarting the simulator and turning location services on and off in the simulator will get it working again, but it often takes 3 - 4 tries of flipping between Apple and Freeway Drive before it finally works.  It seems to degrade as time goes by until it no longer works at all.\r\n\r\nI found this SO post which shows it is happening to others as well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52726731/location-simulation-not-working-in-xcode-10-and-ios-12\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61)\r\niOS 12.1 (16B91)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nNot sure what to include here."
