    description: "Summary:\r\nFile search in the Files app or apps using UIDocumentBrowserViewController does not reliably find documents stored in Google Drive. I suspect this may be a bug on the integration on Google’s side,  but filing this Radar anyway just in case. And you’re in a better position to follow up with Google about this than we are.\n\nI’m on the team at PSPDFKit making PDF Viewer, which uses UIDocumentBrowserViewController. (https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1120099014?mt=8)\n\nI wish everyone would use iCloud Drive because it’s more reliable, but the reality is that Google Drive is quite popular so it’s desirable for Apple to have this working well in the Files app and apps using UIDocumentBrowserViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOne case where this seems to happen reliably is newly added files but it is not the only situation where files don’t show in search.\n\n1. Open the Files app on iPad\n2. Drag a file from local files into Google Drive in the Files app\n3. Search some text from the name of that dragged file using the search field at the top of the files list\n\nYou can see something similar in our PDF Viewer app when creating a new PDF in Google Drive using the new document button enabled in the UIDocumentBrowserViewController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file in Google Drive should show up in the search results alongside the original in local storage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the file in local storage shows up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
