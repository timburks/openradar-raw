    description: 'Displaying any UIViewController on top of CKSMSComposeController (Messages popup from UIActivityController) doesn''t let me dismiss the keyboard. The reason I am doing it, because it is an audio/video calling application, where user has an ability to disable CallKit. I tried to hide using [UIViewController.view endEditing: YES]; - no result.'
