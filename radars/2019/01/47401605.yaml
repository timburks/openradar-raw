    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a keyboard shortcut for going to springboard, but when I would like to be able to lock my iPad (put the screen to sleep) when using it. If I had to be at springboard to activate this, that would be ok with me. I propose maybe Command-L for lock. Anything will do. A complicated shortcut would be fine as well.\n\nI leave my iPad with the display always on, so I constantly want to lock it in this manner.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to lock the device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUse a keyboard shortcut to lock the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to reach up, find the button, and click it to lock the device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
