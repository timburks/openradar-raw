    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen transitioning an NSCursor (e.g. between `arrow` and `pointingHand`), the cursor often jumps a small amount for a frame or two before jumping back to what seems like the proper position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find somewhere in an app that uses the `pointingHand` cursor, such as the attached HTML file in Safari.\r\n2. Move the mouse between the two halves of the HTML document to toggle between `arrow` and `pointingHand`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe `arrow` cursor transitions into the `pointingHand` cursor and back in a smooth fashion with no jumpiness.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor often (maybe 50% of the time?) jumps (by maybe 10-15 points if I had to guess) very briefly (maybe for a frame or two?) before snapping back to the expected positioning.\r\n\r\nPossibly interesting notes:\r\nIf you open QuickTime Player and make a screen recording, you can't see the cursor jump. But if you watch with your own eyes, or record the screen with your iPhone (use slo-mo), you can see the cursor jump.\r\n\r\nYou can see the same issue in Preview. Open a wide or tall document, then hold Option-Space to switch to the open-hand cursor, and release to go to crosshair. Repeat a few times and you'll see the jump.\r\n\r\nOnce you see it, you can't un-see it. Sorry.\r\n\r\nBaseless conjecture:\r\nIt might happen more between cursors that have different hot spots?\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14.2 (18C54)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014)"
