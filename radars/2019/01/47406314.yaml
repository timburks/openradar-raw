    description: "When a document-based app used `UIActivityViewController` and provides the URL to a document that is stored in iCloud Drive (e.g., use `UIDocument.fileURL`), the \"Add People\"/\"Show People\" activity will be available. This let's users share the iCloud Drive document with other users.\r\n\r\n*It would be useful if this activity would pick up other activity items, in particular strings, so that a custom message can be passed on.*\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Present `UIActivityViewController` providing both the URL to a document that is stored in iCloud Drive as well as a string.\r\n- Launch the app and tap the \"Add People\" activity.\r\n- Select the message or mail option.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\n- The string is part of the message or mail, along with the default link to the shared document.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\n- The message or mail only consists of the default link to the shared document, the string is ignored."
