    description: "Summary:\r\nIt appears that when an image exceeds around 2000px horizontal or vertical, the Files app will only render a downsampled version of the asset meaning that as a user — I cannot view the image at actual size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Save an image asset with detail (to gauge quality downgrade) of 3000px square to a folder in Files/iCloud Drive.\r\n• Navigate to image asset to inspect quality once saved.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to view (pinch to zoom and pan) an image that exceeds well beyond 2000px X or Y — particularly on the new iPad Pro.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage quality is downgraded, and dimensions downscaled. This is unexpected behaviour and there is no indication of what those limits are.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1.1 (16C50)"
