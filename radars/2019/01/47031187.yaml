    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an SFSafariViewController is presented from a view controller in a popover presentation, and then dismissed via its “Done” top-left button, the popover is laid out full-screen (as opposed to retaining its popover size and position) doing the dismissal animation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Present a view controller inside of a popover\n- Present a SFSafariViewController from the popover\n- Press “Done”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view controller inside the popover retains its size and position that it had before the SafariVC was presented\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view controller inside the popover is laid out taking the whole bounds of the window while the SafariVC is dismissing (“popping”), and then snaps back to its original position when the dismissal animation is done.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
