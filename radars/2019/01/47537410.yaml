    description: "The XCTest Framework in its current capacity does not provide us Developers/QA  with the ability to rerun failed/flaky tests. It would be nice to have a feature like this implemented wherein you could specify how many times you would like to run flaky tests and they would be run that many times. What i am looking for is something similar to a @Retry annotation which TestNG (http://static.javadoc.io/org.testng/testng/6.13/org/testng/IRetryAnalyzer.html) & JUnit test frameworks have. \r\nI don't think the current XCTest framework has anything like this, so it would be nice to have it implemented as it would benefit everyone. If such a thing already exists, then please point me in the right direction."
