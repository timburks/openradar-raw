    description: "Area:\r\nTerminal\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApplying a Password Policy profile may break ability for `sudo su` to authenticate properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Password Policy profile with requirements that make current password non-compliant. (Example: set current password to `password`, apply profile that requires numbers in password)\r\n2. Open Terminal\r\n3. Type `sudo su`\r\n4. Attempt to authenticate.\r\n5. Note that user is prompted to reset the password. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should be allowed to successfully change the password, if prompted in Terminal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCommand results in `Sorry` message and the user is unable to proceed despite having provided the correct credentials. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nConfirmed in 10.14.2, unclear if it appears earlier. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUser account with password set."
