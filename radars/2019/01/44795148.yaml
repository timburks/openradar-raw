    description: "Summary:\r\nSince Mojave, enabling touchpad dragging makes tap to click way less reliable\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n∙ Enable Tap to click in System Preferences → Trackpad → Point & Click\r\n∙ Enable drag-lock in System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse & Trackpad → Trackpad Options… → Enable dragging with or without drag lock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping once anywhere on the trackpad should click immediately, the way it is with dragging disabled. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTapping once anywhere on the trackpad does nothing most of the time, but double tapping results in a click. \r\n\r\nA single tap *does* work when I use a very small touch area like the very tip of my thumb, so with dragging enabled the touchpad seems to ignore taps with a bigger touch area. But tapping is nowhere near as fast, nor reliable when using the side of my thumb, as with dragging disabled. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS Mojave 10.14 (18A391)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)"
