    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen implementing IAP renewable subscriptions and changing the renewal option within a subscription group (e.g. changing from a monthly to a yearly subscription) the transaction observer (paymentQueue:queue:transactions:) always gets passed a transaction with a .failed transactionState even though the subscription change seems to have gone through successfully (according to the \"Your are all set\" alert and the server-to-server notification and receipt validation).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAssuming that 3 features are available on IAP Subscription: (1-Week, 3-Months, 1-Year)\n\n- Subscribe to 1-WEEK feature\n- Wait for completion\n- Change subscription to 3-WEEK\n- \"Your are all set\" is displayed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA transaction with transactionState = .purchased is sent to the SKPaymentTransactionObserver. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA transaction with transactionState = .failed is sent to the SKPaymentTransactionObserver. The transaction.error:\nError Domain=SKErrorDomain Code=0 \"Cannot connect to iTunes Store\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1.3 (16D5032a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame error occurs on iOS 11.x, too."
