    description: "Summary:\r\nNon-printing characters, especially in strings, are hard to notice, and can cause subtle bugs. Xcode should either show an error/warning in such cases, or should render these characters in a special way that makes it more obvious that they are present.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to run this code:\r\n\r\nlet url = URL(string: \"https://apple.com\") // valid URL\r\nlet sadness = URL(string: \"‌https://apple.com\") // zero-width joiner at start of string, invalid URL\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt’s trivially easy to tell that the first string has all printing characters, and the second has a U+200D ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER at the start. Xcode either shows a warning/error or renders the character as some kind of special glyph, maybe one that you can click on to get more info.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode does nothing to help you see what’s going on. Your only chance of noticing is either a) enumerating the string character-by-character, or b) using the arrow keys to move one character at a time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61) on macOS 10.14.2 (18C54)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUseful site for seeing non-printing characters in a string: https://www.soscisurvey.de/tools/view-chars.php."
