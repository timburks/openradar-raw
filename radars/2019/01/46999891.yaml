    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you ⌘-tab to Safari, open a new tab, paste a URL and then press enter. Safari sometimes misses this and just show you an empty page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. ⌘-C URL\n2. ⌘-tab to Safari\n3. ⌘-T (for new tab)\n4. ⌘-V \n5. Return (or enter)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo go that URL in a new page\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nURL disappears, sad empty Safari page is mocking me \n\n[pjaspers intensifies] \n\noh how it mocks me.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0.1 (14606.2.104.1.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is some SPEED required to engage this bug, I have a made small documentary out of it, which you van view here: https://pile.pjaspers.com/Untitled-uGCaV1.mov\n\nAs you can see, if I work at normal human speeds it works just fine. But when I go into full-pjaspers-speed the machine isn't able to handle the raw speed of my actions® (I just do ⌘-V and enter, but humour me, filing a radar is not exactly the most glamorous highlight of my day)"
