    description: "Closed: old\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen we try to compile our apps for iOS for the Appstore something in Xcode 10.1 allocates too much wired memory to the point where the computer becomes unresponsive for a prolonged period of time.\r\nChanging from building with dwarf and dsyms to only dwarf resolves it but this is not an option for a shipped App.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an app which uses 3rd party frameworks and use DWARF with DSYM debug information format.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould build in a reasonable amount of time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTakes abnormally long, computer becomes unresponsive\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.1\r\nBuild version 10B61"
