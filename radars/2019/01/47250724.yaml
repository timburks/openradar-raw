    description: "It would be GREAT to have a utility class (like UIImagePickerController) that read the information off of credit cards and provided just the card information, and no image, to the calling application.\r\n\r\nWhy? There are many apps that ask for camera permission only to read a credit card, which will be stored, and the camera will never be used again by that app. At the moment, a user needs to go into Settings and revoke the camera permission after completing payment setup in order to maintain the expected privacy of the application.\r\n\r\nApple could provide a mechanism for app developers to get the card info that did not require the user to trust the application with unlimited use of the camera."
