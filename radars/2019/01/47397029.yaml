    description: "Summary:\r\nI asked Siri to tell me when fifteen (15) business days would be after a certain date. Instead of counting, and at least not understanding to calculate business days (rather than calendar days), Siri’s response was just to give me a year after the date I provided.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI asked Siri to tell me when would be fifteen (15) business days after January 11. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected it to tell me the answer (I’ve now counted it out), which is February 1, 2019.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI hadn’t done the math or looked at a calendar, but the answer it gave was January 20, 2020.  From the attached screenshot, it is clear that Siri understood what I asked, but it didn’t quite figure out how to translate that. Off the top of my head, I didn’t immediately know the answer, but I at least knew it wasn’t in the year 2020.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14.2 (18C54)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
