    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter a month of intense usage of the latest \"Butterfly keyboard\" on the MacBook Pro late 2018, I still find it hard to have a decent typing performance and suffer a lot from keyboard navigation by means of the cursor keys and their small up- and down-arrow layout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- while typing normal text, I hit two keys more often than with the previous \"Scissor keyboard\"\n- while navigating through text, moving the cursor around by means of (blindly) using the arrow keys is almost impossible and I find myself actively looking at the keyboard in search of the correct arrow thus severely reducing my typing speed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- using the keyboard should be a no-brainer\n- finding the correct keys should feel comfortable and muscle memory should easily serve the intended input\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- (as a software developer) I'm heavily distracted and interrupted by the latest/newest \"Butterfly keyboard\" mechanics and esp. the awkward cursor layout\n- my typing speed is much lower than before\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n15,2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
