    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen returning a non-successful response with a custom message for a custom intent, Siri simply says \"Sorry, there was a problem with the app\" rather than my custom message. Setting my response to a successful response results in the message being spoken, but I want my response to be reported as non-successful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a SiriKit extension with a custom intent\r\n2. Create a non-successful response type with a custom message\r\n3. Call the completion block with the non-successful result either in the confirm or handle methods.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should respond with my custom message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri says \"Sorry, there was a problem with the app\" regardless of what I specify as my custom message."
