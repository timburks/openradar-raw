    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a Logitech Circle 2 camera connected via Homekit. When on MacOS (10.14 (18A391)) and my Airpods connected (I do not have another bluetooth headset to verify that it goes beyond Airpods) when loading the video feed, the audio will switch over to the degraded audio quality as expected because the camera has an intercom feature. After exiting the video feed view sometimes the audio quality will not return to normal. I've tried changing the audio input source back to internal microphone and there was no change. Removing my headphones, putting them back in the case and power cycling the computer's bluetooth does not fix the problem. The only fix I've found is a full system reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Using Homekit on Mac connect to the video feed of a Logitech Circle 2 (Possibly any camera with an intercom feature) and using Airpods\r\n- Open video feed (Audio quality should degrade)\r\n- Close video feed\r\n- Close HomeKit app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio quality should return to normal upon closing of video feed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio quality does not return to normal until computer reboot"
