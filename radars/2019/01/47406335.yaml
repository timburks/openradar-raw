    description: "When a user is sharing an iCloud Drive document of a document-based app using `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, `UIDocumentPickerViewController` or `UIActivityViewController`, the recipient will get a message and upon tapping that link, the document will show in the Files app. *It would be nice, if the file could open directly in the app, if it's already installed.*\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Present `UIActivityViewController` providing both the URL to a document that is stored in iCloud Drive as well as a string.\r\n- Launch the app and tap the \"Add People\" activity.\r\n- Select message or mail and share it with someone.\r\n- On the device of that other person, open the message.\r\n- Tap the link in the message and confirm with \"Open\".\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\n- If the app is installed, the document should open right in the app.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\n- The document is displayed in the Files app."
