    description: "Summary: \r\niOS 12.2 beta introduces a new permission setting in Settings called \"Motion & Orientation Access\" which is off by default. This breaks all existing webpages that use Motion & Orientation functionality including all AR/VR experiences powered by Mozilla A-Frame, 8th Wall, Amazon Sumerian and others. This immediately breaks large branded experiences such as Sony Picture's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse AR (https://intothespiderverse-ar.com), Dreamworks/Universal's First Man AR (https://moon.firstman.com/), Netflix's She-Ra VR (http://dreamworkstv.com/she-ra/) and many others. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nUpgrade to iOS 12.2 beta and navigate to any site that uses IMU information. Example developed by Google here: https://konterball.com/\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nMove the paddle by rotating the gyro to play the game. \r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nDevice unresponsive when rotated, no view of game assets in sight.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 12.2 beta\r\n\r\nConfiguration: iPhone 8 Plus"
