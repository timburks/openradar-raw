    description: "Summary:\r\nAs a user I want to be able to buy any app from any of the App Stores: macOS app from an iPhone/iPad/Apple TV, iOS/tvOS app from a MacBook Pro, an iOS/macOS app from tvOS.\nSpecifically not being able to buy iPad apps from an iPhone is super frustrating.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSurfing the web for apps, I eventually click on a link for the corresponding app store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want to be able to buy the software even if I am currently not at the \"destination platform\" for this app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI'm blocked either with a broken flow or by means of an error message, that the app is not compatible with the current device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nany\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a user I am well aware of the situation to not use the app immediately but as I have all these devices in multiple versions for years, the app stores should be smarter and not limit myself. This would especially help to better discover and convert apps altogether."
