    description: "iCloud has powerful sharing features, which are especially useful for document-based apps. The \"Add People\"/\"Show People\" view controller let's users share individual documents stored in iCloud Drive and select granular access permissions. Unfortunately, this view controller is only accessible indirectly through the `UIActivityViewController` (by providing the `fileURL` to a `UIDocument` that is stored in iCloud Drive).\r\n\r\n*It would be great to be able to present it directly, to, say, add a collaboration button to a document-based app, similar to what iWork does.* The \"Add People\"/\"Show People\" view controller could then presented as a pop-over on iPad attached to that button.\r\n\r\nFor this, it would also be good if that view controller can also expose whether the document is already shared or not, in order to pick an appropriate icon."
