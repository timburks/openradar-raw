    description: "Users can share the documents of a document-based app, if they are stored in iCloud Drive, using the Files app, `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, `UIDocumentPickerViewController` or the `UIActivityViewController`.\r\n\r\n*It would be great if the app could detect whether a particular file is shared and ideally, with whom.* This would allow the app to present custom UI indicators to show what files are shared and which are private to the user.\r\n\r\nAn appropriate place for this could be through `NSFileManager` or a convenience method in `UIDocument`."
