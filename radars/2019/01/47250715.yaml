    description: "Animoji is a fun way to enhance FaceTime calls. However as AR becomes more prevalent and useful in apps, it would great to share this experience with people in a FaceTime call.\r\n\r\nSome examples would be:\r\n- “what do you think of these sunglasses I’m thinking of buying from this shop?”\r\n- “do you this this sofa would look good in this corner?”"
