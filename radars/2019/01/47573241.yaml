    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning `xcrun simctl list devices --json` to list the available devices produces an output that appears not to be backwards compatible with Xcode 10.1.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the JSON \"devices\" object is missing entries of \"iOS 12.1\", etc. that identify devices given the platform.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if that's a regression or working as intended.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun `xcrun simctl list devices --json` using Xcode 10.2 beta 1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA JSON output that includes a platform entry with a list of devices.\r\n\r\nSample output at \"simctl-list-devices_expected.json\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSample output at \"simctl-list-devices_actual.json\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.2 beta 1\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nA bit of a background.\r\n\r\nI installed Xcode 10.2 beta 1, alongside the existing installation of Xcode 10.1, as well as the Additional Tools when prompted as part of launching Xcode for the first time.\r\n\r\n* I tried to explicitly set the Xcode installation using `xcode-select -s` to Xcode 10.1  but doesn't seem to change the output.\r\n* Removing Xcode 10.2 beta 1 from /Applications doesn't seem to change the output."
