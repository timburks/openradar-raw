    description: "Area:\r\nSecurity Framework\r\n\r\nFollowing from a discussion on the Apple Developer Forums, I am raising this enhancement as proposed by eskimo at apple.com (Apple Developer Relations, Developer Technical Support, Core OS/Hardware).\r\n\r\nThread:\r\nRSA public/private key generates with swift does not compatible with any other platforms\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/message/256298\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nOften public/private keys and other cryptographic material (certificates, lists, requests, messages, etc) must be transmitted to and received from various parties in various formats. This often involves structuring the material according to ASN.1, encoding and decoding according to BER or DER, then further encoding/decoding for transmission/reception over text protocols such as HTTPS using PEM/Base64.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive overview of common formats used, refer to RFC 7468 (proposed standard).\r\n\r\nThe existing iOS Security APIs make it difficult to transform cryptographic material between these formats. Providing base APIs to manage common cryptographic structures and encodings (ASN.1, BER, DER, PEM) would be useful. In addition, providing convenience methods to transform between formats proposed in RFC 7468 would be even more developer-friendly.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nTextual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468\r\n\r\nPCKS#8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification v1.2 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5208.txt"
