    description: "There are a number of domains that SiriKit supports. I'm missing a place search / POI finding domain that would support invocation phrases like this\r\n\r\n- Show me nearby <category> places\r\n- Navigate to the next <category>\r\n- Call a <category> near <location>\r\n\r\nINSearchForNotebookItemsIntent is a bit similar but focused on notes instead of places."
