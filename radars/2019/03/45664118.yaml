    description: "I'm loading images from server. So, I'll return nil from QLPreviewItem's previewItemURL if the image is downloading. Until iOS 10, QLPreviewController shows \"loading\" until I return non-nil value. This no longer the case from iOS 11.0.\r\n\r\nFrom the official documentation of QLPreviewItemURL (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartz/qlpreviewitem/1419913-previewitemurl):\r\n\"If the item is not available for preview, this property’s getter method should return nil. In this case, the QLPreviewController displays a “loading” view.\"\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the official developer documentation of previewItemURL, we can return nil for this property and in that case, QLPreviewController will show the loading view.  This works fine until iOS 10. But from iOS 11 onwards, it doesn't show the loading."
