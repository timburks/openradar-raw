    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe delegate method is invoked twice upon pulling the Notification Center, when the center is extended completely and when it’s dismissed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app project using the Single View App template.\r\n2. Put print(\"app did become active\") into applicationDidBecomeActive(_:) method of the application delegate.\r\n3. Build & start the app.\r\n4. Pull the Notification Center from the top.\r\n5. Dismiss it to get back to the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTwo “app did become active” console messages, one printed on app launch and another on notification center dismissal. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThree “app did become active” console messages.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.1.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease note that UIApplication.didBecomeActive behaves the same way, i.e. posted twice when pulling & dismissing the notification center.\r\n\r\niOS 11 is also affected, although I couldn’t reproduce it on iOS 10."
