    description: "Summary:\r\nSince updating to Xcode 10.2 I'm getting a bunch of scary warnings when I try to build my app. They all start with \"ignoring build task 'ConstructedTask(forTarget: SoupKit, 3 inputs, 1 outputsâ€¦\" and end with \"This warning represents an extremely serious project misconfiguration and will cause some build tasks in your project to be skipped entirely, leading to other build failures or missing files in the build directory.\"\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the warnings mention an Intents.strings file, and the error suggests that the conflicting tasks are for the exact same file. I suspect the warnings are not as serious as the message makes them sound, but needless to say I'm not really comfortable ignoring them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS project\r\n1. Add an intents extension including an .intentdefinition file\r\n2. Add a localization to that file\r\n3. Set the deployment target to iOS 10.3 or earlier\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this using the \"SoupChef\" sample app provided by Apple, with some minor modifications. Here's the original demo: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/soup_chef_accelerating_app_interactions_with_shortcuts All I did to reproduce the warning was add localizations for Intents.intentdefinition, set the deployment target to iOS 10.3, and then fix some errors so the project would build. This project is attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should not get any warnings about the .intentsdefinition file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are several warnings like this:\r\n:-1: ignoring build task 'ConstructedTask(forTarget: SoupKit, 3 inputs, 1 outputs, ruleInfo: [\"CopyStringsFile\", \"/Users/username/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SoupChef-rojbzdehurmlgakeaipmwucmevgx/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/SoupKit.framework/en.lproj/Intents.strings\", \"/Users/username/Downloads/SoupChefAcceleratingAppInteractionsWithShortcuts/Shared/en.lproj/Intents.strings\"])' which produces files already produced by another task:\r\n/Users/username/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SoupChef-rojbzdehurmlgakeaipmwucmevgx/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/SoupKit.framework/en.lproj/Intents.strings\r\nThis warning represents an extremely serious project misconfiguration and will cause some build tasks in your project to be skipped entirely, leading to other build failures or missing files in the build directory. (in target 'SoupKit')\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.2 (10E125)"
