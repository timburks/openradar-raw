    description: "Chrome observes occasional crashes in the AE framework's quotedStr(char const*, unsigned long) function. The function performs logic like the following:\r\n\r\nquotedStr(unsigned char* ptr, size_t len) {\r\n  if (memchr(ptr, '\"', len) || ptr[len] || memchr(ptr, 0, len-1)) {\r\n    /* ... */\r\n\r\nWhen it accesses ptr[len] it performs an off-by-one OOB read. ptr[len - 1] is the last valid array value. This can lead to crashes when the 'ptr' allocation lands on the rightmost edge of the heap and ptr[len] accesses unmapped memory.\r\n\r\nWhen quotedStr() crashes it is always reached from implAsStr(). implAsStr() is reached from either AESendMessage() calling descAsString() or AEProcessMessage() calling aeProcessIncomingEvent(AEDesc*). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A, these crashes have been observed in the wild.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nThese crashes have been observed in versions of macOS up to 10.14.3 and I have confirmed that assembly for this function in AE in 10.14.4 still includes the off-by-one array access."
