    description: "Area:\r\n\r\nMail\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen Mail displays an email that contains data in the multipart/alternative format (as described in RFC 1521, section 7.2.3), the app currently has the following behaviour: the last part inside the email is always displayed regardless of Content-Type it has set.\r\n\r\nHowever, per the specification, the email client is expected to ignore a format that it doesn't recognize or can't display. For example, if the last part is in the \"text/x-whatever\" format, this means the sender prefers this format, but the client should only display it if it can display \"text/x-whatever\". If not, it should revert to one of the previous, less preferred formats (one of which is usually text/plain or text/html).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSend a multipart/alternative email containing the following formats in that order:\r\ntext/plain\r\ntext/html\r\ntext/x-other\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe text/x-other part is ignored because the text/x-other Content-Type can't be displayed and text/html (second preferred format) is displayed instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOn iOS: The text/x-other part is assumed to be text/html and is displayed instead. text/html part is not displayed.\r\n\r\nOn macOS: The text/x-other part is displayed as plain text. text/html part is not displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nOn iOS: Mail version 1.3.2, iOS version 12.1.4\r\n\r\nOn macOS: Mail version 11.5 (3445.9.1)"
