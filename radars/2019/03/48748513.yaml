    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen viewing the HTML export of a Keynote presentation on a mobile device in portrait mode, only a fraction of the presentation is visible (tried this with multiple presentations, multiple (WebKit-based) browsers, multiple devices, and the iOS simulator). This is improved by switching to landscape and back to portrait, which means that the portrait presentation depends on whether you've visited landscape.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the exported DisplayManager.js, specifically in the line:\r\n\r\nsetElementPosition(this.infoPanelIcon, this.usableDisplayHeight - kInfoPanelButtonHeight, this.usableDisplayWidth - kInfoPanelButtonWidth - 5, kInfoPanelButtonWidth, kInfoPanelButtonHeight)\r\n\r\nThe info panel button sizes aren't defined, so the layout function exits before doing the rest of its work. Removing this statement fixes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. From Keynote (for macOS): File -> Export to -> HTML. Export.\r\n2. Place the resulting directory (called, e.g., `bugtest`) somewhere where it can be served to the mobile browser. Here, I'll use jekyll to serve it (convenient for my use case).\r\n3. Open the slides  (e.g., `bugtest/index.html`) in Safari on a mobile device in portrait mode.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, switch portrait -> landscape -> portrait to show that portrait is different after a landscape than before it.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the specific attached images:\r\n\r\n1_portrait : after step 3 above (using iOS Simulator as iPhone XR, 12.1)\r\n2_landscape : rotate to landscape mode after 1_portrait\r\n3_portrait : rotate back to portrait mode after 2_landscape\r\n4_fixed : comment out the javascript line mentioned above; open/reload in portrait mode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFull slide visible when viewed in mobile Safari.\r\n\r\nPortrait mode should look the same before or after a switch to landscape.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFraction of slide visible in mobile Safari with first loaded in portrait mode. \r\n\r\nPortrait mode looks different after a switch to landscape.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nKeynote 8.3 (5989)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nSimplest test occurs when viewing in iOS simulator when served by jekyll.\r\n\r\nAlso occurs when Keynote is embedded in iframe, viewed iPhone XS, XR, or iOS Simulator, served with Apache."
