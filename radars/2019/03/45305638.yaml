    description: "Summary:\r\nOnce selecting a variable and picking Edit in Scope via the jump menu, the default visual seems like the whole variable name is selected. It has both solid dark blue background like other occurrences in the scope (I guess it shouldn't have, see default state of Rename tool – `refactor_rename` image) and another rounded selection colour, slightly lighter one, which might be understood as a word selection, although it doesn't behave like that – see `double_selection_background` image.\r\n\r\nI've recorded a short video – `edit_in_scope` attachment. I try a few basic actions after picking the Edit in Scope option:\r\n\r\n• Press left arrow – I expect to move the cursor to the beginning of the variable name, but I'm out of the editing context and it's effectively cancelled.\r\n• Press right arrow – again, I expect to move the cursor to the end of the variable name, but instead, I'm at index 1 of the variable name.\r\n• Start typing – I expect to replace the whole variable name. Instead, I'm adding characters at the beginning of the variable name.\r\n\r\nBoth the dark blue indication and light blue textual selection seem to work invalid in comparison with Rename → Refactor function.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProbably the easiest solution – make the default state the same as if I choose Refactor → Rename – variable name properly selected, with only related light blue selection background, no solid dark blue like on other occurrences.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Hight Sierra latest @ Mac mini 2012"
