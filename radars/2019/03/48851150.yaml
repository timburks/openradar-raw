    description: "The coremlc generate tool generates Swift sources which do not have the public visibility attributes set. This makes it harder to include the generated sources in Frameworks to share them across apps and extensions, since they are not public and therefore not accessible from the app or extension targets.\r\n\r\nCould the coremlc generate tool generate public declarations instead? Or at least be configurable to generate public declarations? This would avoid the need for SwiftSyntax tools or wrapper classes to access these symbols from the framework."
