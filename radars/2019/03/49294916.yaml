    description: "Here's some sample code that works fine in Xcode 10.1, but fails to compile in 10.2 even though it's valid code.\r\n\r\n// This variable uses #if to create two possible code paths, in this example, it's just using `true`, but\r\n// in my real project it uses a variable defined in the Scheme. The result is the same.\r\n// The error here is that Xcode is disallowing the use of the variable name `firstVar` inside the braces\r\n// which is perfectly valid code. You can see it work correctly below in `secondVar`.\r\nlet firstVar: String = {\r\n    #if true\r\n        let firstVar: String = \"One\"\r\n    #else\r\n        let firstVar: String = \"Two\"\r\n    #endif\r\n    return firstVar // Variable used within its own initial value\r\n}()\r\n\r\n// This variable breaks down to the exact same code, but without the #if and it works correctly.\r\nlet secondVar: String = {\r\n    let secondVar: String = \"Three\"\r\n    return secondVar // Essentially the same code, but with no error\r\n}()\r\n\r\nPlayground attached as well.\r\n\r\nThe #if/#else/#endif code seems to be confusing the compiler and thus it is mixing up scope.\r\n\r\nXcode Version 10.2 (10E125) -> Broken\r\nXcode Version 10.1 (10B61) -> Works correctly"
