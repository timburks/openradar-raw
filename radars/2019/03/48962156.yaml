    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nUIButton would benefit greatly from proper support for different border colors per UIControl state.\r\n\r\nA very common design for buttons is a button with text and a border around it. However, to do this properly, the border color should change or update itself according to the UIControl state of the button. For example, a button could have a blue border for its normal state and a grey border for its disabled state.\r\n\r\nCurrently, that's hard to do, causing developers to come up with hacks around UIButton that cause other conveniences or features for users to break. \r\n\r\nProposed API:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen func UIButton.setBorderColor(_ color: UIColor, for controlState: UIControl.State)\r\nopen func UIButton.borderColor(for controlState: UIControl.State)\r\n```"
