    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Assistant Editor to edit a Test Classes file, the source code indentation settings from Xcode Preferences are used instead of the project-specific override settings defined for the project/workspace.\r\n\r\nWhen the same file is edited in the main editor, the correct (project/workspace) indentation settings) are used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Xcode > Preferences > Text Editing > Indentation, prefer Intent using Spaces and set Tab Width and Indent Width to 2.\r\n2. Create a new iOS Objective-C single-view application (or use the attached test project) and make sure that you include Unit Tests\r\n3. Click the Project navigator, select the top level project and open the Inspector at the right-side of the Xcode window\r\n4. Under Text Settings, set Tab Width to 4 and Indent Width to 4\r\n5. Create a ViewControllerTests.m test file in Objective-C, and make sure you include and reference ViewController.h in that file. Save it.\r\n6. Open the ViewControllerTests.m file in the MAIN EDITOR and confirm that the 4-space indent settings are being respected.\r\n7. Now, open ViewController.m in the MAIN EDITOR and open the Assistant Editor for Test Classes. Note that ViewControllerTests.m correctly opens in the Assistant Editor.\r\n8. Now start typing a test method in the Assistant Editor. Note that the indent width is 2 when it should be 4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject-specific indent settings should be respected for all files in the project, and for both the main and assistant editors.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode default indent settings are used when editing a test class file in the Assistant Editor.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0b5 (8S193k)\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nOS X 10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways reproducible using iOS Objective-C projects. Not sure about Swift projects."
