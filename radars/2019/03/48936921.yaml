    description: "WKWebView shows a built-in context menu when long-pressing URLs or images.\r\n3rd party browsers (such as Firefox iOS) will want to install their own context menu to present options specific to their application.\r\n\r\nThe request is for the web view to callback (perhaps by a delegate) when a long-press gesture on a link or image has occurred, so that the native menu is not shown, with parameters for\r\n- url\r\n- type (image, or link)\r\n- location of touch"
