    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOn a project that targets a fairly old version of iOS, thus compatible with all of the updates since, while testing builds in different simulators at the same time, it’s really cumbersome re-targeting the build for a simulator that I already have running. \r\n\r\nFor instance, the “iPad Pro (12.9-inch)” simulator has 7 variants available to pick from, and the difference in naming between them can really easily be overlooked:\r\n\r\n- iPad Pro (12.9-inch)\r\n- iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (11.4)\r\n- iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (12.1)\r\n- iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation) (10.3.1)\r\n- iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation) (11.4)\r\n- iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation) (12.1)\r\n- iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (3rd generation) (10.3.1)\r\n\r\nAnd this pattern is repeated for basically every device that the project can be targeted to run on.\r\n\r\nThe running simulators are not highlighted in any way in the simulator menu that’s displayed in Xcode, only the current one selected has a check mark next to its name.\r\n\r\nIt would be really useful if the running simulators were grouped together at the top of the list so that we could get to them more easily, avoiding confusion and the unnecessary booting of new simulators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a project with a fairly old platform version target in Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe simulators that are already booted and ready to be used are grouped together in the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere’s no way to distinguish which simulators are already booted.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.1"
