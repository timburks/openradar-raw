    description: "Currently it is only possible to specify a loop region which start at some timestamp and ends exactly at the end of the track by setting the track property  kSequenceTrackProperty_LoopInfo. This is very limited. I want to be able to set  loop region to whatever range I want. To do it now I will need to make some ugly ineffective stuff like trimming the whole sequence every time I set a loop that is not snapped to the end of the sequence. \r\n\r\nSo please add startTimestamp and endTimestamp to the MusicTrackLoopInfo struct instead of the duration."
