    description: "Summary:\r\nBoth I and a number of employees within The Warehouse Group have upgraded or otherwise replaced our iPhones, and restored from backup. We use an app that is developed in-house (The Warehouse App), and sent push notifications out to our customers of sales. Neither myself or any of the other people whom have replaced our phones have not had any push notifications sent.\r\nIn fact, I have had another app (Powershop) end up sending me duplicated push notifications much to the developers confusion.\r\nI have considered it always reproducible in that I always either get send duplicates or no notifications, but not easily in that for the production apps we build I cannot test this as I will send it to all our customers, not just myself and the others in the company that are affected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app that sends push notifications\r\n2. allow push notifications\r\n3. backup to iTunes\r\n4. buy new phone\r\n5. setup new phone from backup\r\n6. observe that others get notifications from the app but not you..?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be sent notifications if I allowed them in the intended quantity through the replaced phone without revoking the permission.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI do not get notifications, or I get duplicate notifications.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1.4(16D57)\r\niPhone 10s Max\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
