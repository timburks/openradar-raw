    description: "The UnitConcentrationMass offers an initializer for the unit millimolesPerLiter that takes a gramsPerMole parameter. The official documentation states that the coefficient to the base unit (g/L) is 18 * gramsPerMole.\r\n\r\nThe factor of 18 seems superfluous, and yields an erroneous result when converting a Measurement in millimolesPerLiter to a value in gramsPerLiter. Also, the conversion is off by 3 orders of magnitude (10e3)\r\n\r\nA simple dimensional analysis can show that the factor 18 is superfluous and the conversion millimole to mole (* 10e3) is not accounted for.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- NaCl (table salt) has a molecular mass of 58 g/mol (see Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration#Examples)\r\n- Let's imagine a solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L (i.e. 1000 millimoles per Liter)\r\n- With 1 mol/L and 58 g/mol, the same concentration of 1 mol/L is equivalent to 58 g/L\r\n\r\nAs a result, to conversion coefficient for millimolesPerLiter to the base unit (g/L) should be \"gramsPerMole / 1000\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee attached playground \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSwift 4.2"
