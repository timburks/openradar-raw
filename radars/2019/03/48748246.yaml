    description: "When running UI Tests in Xcode it is possible to set a GPX file to be used for location simulation.\r\n\r\nThis is reflected in the Scheme as a LocationScenarioReference like the following:\r\n<LocationScenarioReference\r\n    identifier = \"../locations.gpx\"\r\n    referenceType = \"0\">\r\n\r\nThis configuration is not respected when executing the scheme using an equivalent xcodebuild invocation.\r\nIt would be desirable for the invocation through xcodebuild to mirror the behavior in Xcode for continuous integration."
