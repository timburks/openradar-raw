    description: "Duplicate of: 16207533        \r\nStatus: Open      \r\nCan be replicated in: Xcode 10.1 (10B61) on macOS 10.14.3 (18D109)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you select the Text Editing preferences to Automatically trim trailing whitespace Including whitespace-only lines, you can still save a file with whitespace on whitespace only lines.\r\n\r\nThis causes problems for linting tools like Swift Lint (https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) as they will report warnings for whitespace on empty lines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any Xcode project or create a new one.\r\n2. Verify the two Text Editing preferences are selected. \"Automatically trim trailing whitespace\" and \"Including whitespace-only lines\". \r\n3. Choose a .swift, .h or .m file.\r\n4. Hit the 'return' key one or more times (but don't move the cursor).\r\n5. Take note of which line the cursor is placed.\r\n6. Use the project navigator to navigate away from the file (this will cause the edited file to save).\r\n7. Navigate back to the file you edited.\r\n8. The line where the cursor was will contain whitespace.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe line where the cursor was should not contain whitespace.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe line where the cursor was will contain whitespace.\r\nOther developers experience this bug. See thread: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/18#issuecomment-253801311\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0/8A218a & OS X 10.11.6/15G1004"
