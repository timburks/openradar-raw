    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ClockKit API docs for CLKSimpleTextProvider specify the following: \"When creating a simple text provider, you can specify both a long version and a short version of your text. Providing both strings gives you more control over the text displayed by your complication.\" This works for many complication styles, but at least two of the new Infograph complication styles fail to fall back to the short text when the long version is too long. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a CLKComplicationTemplateGraphicCircularOpenGaugeSimpleText or CLKComplicationTemplateGraphicCircularOpenGaugeRangeText\r\n2. Assign it a CLKSimpleTextProvider with text that is too long (in the attached test project, the month \"MAR\"), and shortText that is sufficiently short (in the test project, \"M\"). \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe complication will fall back to the short text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe complication displays the long text, truncated by ellipses.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome of my users, in reporting this behavior, have suggested that I shrink the font size slightly to fit all three characters of the month in the gauge. This would be preferable, but ClockKit does not have an option for this (possibly by design). Either way, the short text should be a viable fallback, and is for almost all other complication styles; the new Infograph complications seem to be the odd ones out in this regard. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nwatchOS 5.1.3 (16S535)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Series 4 44mm, as well as simulators for both the 40 and 44mm case size."
