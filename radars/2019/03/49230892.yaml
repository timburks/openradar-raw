    description: "Area:\r\nScreen Saver & desktop\r\n\r\nMy company would like the ability to configure the Mac lock screen and login screen with custom backgrounds but allow the user to customize their desktop background.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would be able to deploy the image/configuration via MDM config profile.\r\n\r\nSome companies may want to deploy separate pictures for login window vs lock screen. It would be good to keep them separate."
