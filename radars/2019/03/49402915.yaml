    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 10.2 with new build system enabled there is always ProcessInfoPlistFile action as a last step even if buildsetting \"Info.plist file\" is empty. It is a problem when actual Info.plist file for app is created in separate script (for example when using xcode with external build system, when all of the bundle creation process is performed in custom action).\r\n\r\nThere should be an option to disable this step or, at least, make it run before custom action.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.2 (10E125)"
