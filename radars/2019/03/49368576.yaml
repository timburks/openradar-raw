    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA freshly downloaded copy of 10.14.4's installer shows signing that expires October 24, 2019. I suspect most (all?) signed installers and updates currently circulating will also have October 2019 expiration dates\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nView the cert info on the 10.14.4 OSInstall.mpkg inside of Installer.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis is expected, but I hope everything can be re-signed and posted for download long before it becomes an actual problem.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHopefully, not another certpocalypse.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201336\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nAll?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll?"
