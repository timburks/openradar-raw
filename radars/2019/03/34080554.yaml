    description: "Summary:\r\nThe code completion could be a bit smarter when hinting to complete a function block given in a form of a variable/parameter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAlthough the source editor has some knowledge about a block type stored in a variable/parameter, the hinted completion is always just a raw var/param name without the parentheses and typed parameter placeholders. This could be a bit smarter and put in this part in cases where applicable.\r\n\r\nI've tried to illustrate it as well as I could in the attached video.\r\n\r\nThe only thing coming on my mind would be an ambiguity about how should the completion behave â€“ it needs to distinguish between a direct call of the function (when it could be completed with param hints) and passing as a variable (where you only want the param name part without the parentheses). But I believe you can handle this somehow. :)\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the code completion could take a param type in mind in situations like assigning to a variable (when completing `int a = {HERE}` it could prefer integer values from the local scope, same applies when hinting parameters like `NSNumber *a = [AnyImpl numberFromString:{HERE}` or `process({HERE})` where defined as `- (id)process(NSString *s)` to prefer NSString*-returning stuff from a local scope etc.).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmarter blocks variable completion.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBasic completion.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 7 and basically all previous Xcode versions"
