    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrade to 10.14.4 public/retail build (18E226), Mail.app (v12.4) can no longer properly authenticate to G Suite for your Domain mail service. Mail either repeatedly asks for password or throws “Enter the password for the account ‘(null)‘. Google requires completing authentication in Safari.” error. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThese steps require having a G Suite for Your Domain/G Suite for your Workplace account. Issue can _not_ be duplicated with a regular Gmail account. \r\n\r\n1. Have an existing G Suite account configured in System Preferences > Internet Accounts and setup in Mail.app\r\n2. Upgrade to 10.14.4\r\n3. Attempt to access account after upgrade\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail should properly connect to G Suite services and provide mail to Mail.app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail.app fails to properly authenticate. Issue also happens if you attempt to setup the account anew or use a second account in the G Suite domain.\r\n\r\n- Accounts are not using 2-factor authentication\r\n- Happens even if G Suite Domain Security and email account security are set to use “Less secure app access”\r\n- Happens on machine both with and without iCloud Keychain enabled. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n18E226\r\n\r\nSee attached animated GIF (10144vsMailvsGsuite.gif) for an example of the behavior. Most current system.log is also attached.\r\n\r\nThank you."
