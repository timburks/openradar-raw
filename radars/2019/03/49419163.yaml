    description: "Area:\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nI'm looking to manage Disk Encryption via MDM. With APFS drives logout is not required anymore, but in order to enable disk encryption via an MDM delivered configuration profile I must use the Defer option. \r\n\r\nAllow for MDM to enforce disk encryption without a logout. \r\n\r\nAttaching the example payload that works today."
