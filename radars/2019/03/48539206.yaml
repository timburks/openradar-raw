    description: "Area:\r\nPerformance (slow, hung)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf an application is offscreen, performance is degraded with no recourse.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTurn on spaces.\r\nOpen an application that is time-based (a web browser with http://flipclockjs.com is sufficient), or maintains a connection with an internet service.\r\n\r\nGo to another space.\r\n\r\nWait. Go back to the original space. Flipclock will have lost four seconds for every ten. If you have an app with a persistent connection, such as a remote control application, you'll become disconnected because the delay will result in a loss of handshaking with the external application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nProcesses not get slowed when offscreen. Remote connections not get disconnected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n18D109\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nPretty stock macbook pro.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nI suspect this might actually be intentional by Apple as it didn't happen in High Sierra, but does in Mojave. IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BE DISABLED. THIS IS SERIOUSLY DAMAGING MY WORKFLOW.\r\n\r\nOh, forgot to mention. This also occurs when the screen is shutoff, but the setting to prevent the computer from sleeping is set. The expected behavior is that the processes are NOT SLOWED. That's why this setting is set, so the computer doesn't slow down when the screen is off.\r\n\r\nFinal test. I wondered if the processes are slowed when a window is occluded, but not off the main screen or the screen turned off. It does not, so that works as expected."
