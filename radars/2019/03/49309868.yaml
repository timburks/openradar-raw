    description: "In Safari 12.1, the View âž¤ Stop menu is no longer disabled when there is nothing to Stop.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from previous versions and leave the user thinking the page is still loading when it has finished.\r\n\r\nThis also impacts automatic detection of completed page loads."
