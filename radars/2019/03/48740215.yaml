    description: "To make exported JavaScript APIs feel more \"JavaScripty\" it would be great to have Initialisers exported to JavaScript instead of relying on factory methods.\r\n\r\nIn the following example it's not possible to init Person in JavaScript directly using `Person(\"Grace\", \"Hopper\")`:\r\n\r\n@objc public protocol PersonJSExports : JSExport {\r\n    var firstName: String { get set }\r\n    var lastName: String { get set }\r\n    \r\n    /// create and return a new Person instance with `firstName` and `lastName`\r\n    ///\r\n    /// The init(firstName:lastName:) initializer won’t be accessible from JavaScript,\r\n    /// because it isn’t part of the exported interface declared by PersonJSExports;\r\n    /// instead, a Person object can be constructed through a type method imported as\r\n    /// Person.createWithFirstNameLastName(_:_:).\r\n    /// Source: https://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/\r\n    static func createWith(firstName: String, lastName: String) -> Person\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Custom class must inherit from `NSObject`\r\n@objc public class Person : NSObject, PersonJSExports {\r\n    // properties must be declared as `dynamic`\r\n    public dynamic var firstName: String\r\n    public dynamic var lastName: String\r\n    \r\n    public required init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {\r\n        self.firstName = firstName\r\n        self.lastName = lastName\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class func createWith(firstName: String, lastName: String) -> Person {\r\n            return Person(firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName)\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt would be fantastic if this would be possible, even though I understand the question around how to expose different initialisers doesn't make it easier either.\r\n\r\n\U0001F64F"
