Add your developer account to Xcode\r\n\r\nBecause, of course, I'm not logged in there.\r\n\r\nI would like a way to either\r\n\r\n- Pass credentials to `xcodebuild […] -allowProvisioningUpdates`, or\r\n- Add an account to Xcode's Accounts preference pane from the command line\r\n\r\nSo that I can use this great feature on my CI server!\r\n\r\nIf you know of any workarounds that don't require using the GUI I would love to hear them"
