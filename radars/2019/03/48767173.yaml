    description: "Methods included in a JSExport protocol in Swift are not exported if they are throwing errors.\r\n\r\n// Custom protocol must be declared with `@objc`\r\n@objc public protocol PersonJSExports : JSExport {\r\n    /// Not exported because of `throws`\r\n    func greet() throws\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe greet function in the example above is not exported, resulting in the following message.\r\n\r\nTypeError: person.greet is not a function. (In 'person.greet()', 'person.greet' is undefined)\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour would be to to run `greet()` and throw any error produced within the method in order to handle it properly within JavaScript using a `try...catch...finally block."
