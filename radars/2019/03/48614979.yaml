    description: "It should be possible to activate the Simulator’s options from the Hardware → Keyboard submenu programmatically. I’m running UI tests, and I want to be able to tap the keys on the software keyboard. That is, not just type keys into a text field using XCUITest, but XCUIApplication().keys[“0”].tap(). This constitutes a more realistic end-to-end test, and will catch the kind of bugs that developers usually miss when running in the simulator, where they are just using their computer’s hardware keyboard.\r\n\r\nHowever, the simulator defaults to having the software keyboard hidden, and when running on a continuous integration server, we don’t have the ability to open the Simulator app and fiddle with the menus, so it would be nice to be able to control this at run time, either via XCUITest, via xcrun simctl, or both."
