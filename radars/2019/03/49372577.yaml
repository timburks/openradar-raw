    description: "When applying a NEHotspotConfiguration the callback returns once the configuration is applied. There is no way of telling why the following connection to the network might have failed. \r\n\r\nIn order to check if it was successful we check if the current SSID matches the desired one after a delay. If it does not, iOS presents an error dialog eventually but there is no callback in code that tells us why it failed. \r\n\r\nThis is causing us much trouble in our app and we have no way of debugging what is going wrong internally.\r\n\r\n*Suggestions*:\r\n- log errors into system log\r\n- introduce callback / delegate for the connection part"
