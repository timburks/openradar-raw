    description: "Summary:\r\nI would kindly like to ask for a further improvement of type awareness in Objective-C.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of type notations (f.e. on `NSArray`s) in Objective-C was a great move.\r\n\r\nTo better compete with Swift world, some gimmicks regarding the type safety and checking would be awesome to see them implemented.\r\n\r\n• strict type-checking of `foreach` (`for (NSString *x in array)` with `array: NSArray<SomeObject *> *`) and other use cases\r\nThis way of Fast enumeration performs no `NSString`×`SomeObject` type checking of `x` variable – even when the `array` is defined as `NSArray<SomeObject *> *`. This applies to arrays, dictionaries, sets, … as well.\r\n\r\n• improved behaviour/definition/return type of `-copy`/`-mutableCopy`\r\nCurrently, `-copy` method gives back an instance of `id` type thus the resulting variable may completely lose any type information. This is even more dangerous when used within the fast enumeration as described above – performing `for (NSString *s in array.copy)` or `NSArray *copiedArray = array; for (NSString *s in copiedArray)` may have fatal (crashing) consequences with no compiler warning/error neither static analyser issue.\r\n\r\n• improve Objective-C type checking in overall\r\n\r\nSome new compiler warnings/errors and static analyser issues would be very welcome!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open an Xcode project written in Objective-C\r\n2) Watch for type safety issues\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMore strict checking.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nPretty good, but not perfect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9, Xcode 10.x"
