    description: "MDM Allows creating an Admin account with the AccountConfiguration command. \r\nHowever, there is no way to specify that this account should be \"MDM Enabled\" (trigger an Authenticate response so the MDM can manage it). \r\n\r\nIf the SkipPrimaryAccountCreation is not disabled, then the account the user creates for themselves does become enabled. \r\nHowever, that's not a desired workflow in all cases. An organization that only has one user per machine would like to have that user be managed, so that it can push User level profiles for that user. \r\n\r\nSuggestion: Allow the AutoSetupAdmiAccounts user to be MDM managed if there are no additional users on the mac. \r\nAlternatively, allow the MDM to specify which account will become the MDM managed account."
