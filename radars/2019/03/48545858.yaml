    description: "Summary:\r\nThe green icon for Time Machine volumes doesn't stick on an external Time Machine volume; it keeps reverting back to the default yellow icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Time Machine Preference.\r\n2. Click \"Add or Remove Backup Disk...\"\r\n3. Select the mounted external drive volume from the Available Disks list.\r\n4. Allow Time Machine backup to complete.\r\n5. The icon on the mounted external drive changes from the default yellow icon to the green Time Machine volume icon.\r\n6. Restart machine with external drive attached OR dismount and remount the drive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icon for the Time Machine volume should stay as the green Time Machine volume\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe icon for the Time Machine volume reverts back to the default yellow drive.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G5019), although it was doing the same thing with Sierra.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe drive is connected to a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) via an Thunderbolt adapter: Drive FW800 -> FW800 to Thunderbolt -> Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt 2 (USB-C).\r\n\r\nI have another Time Machine external drive connected via USB 3 to an iMac, and the Time Machine icon never reverts.\r\n\r\nNote that the volume does NOT have a custom icon."
