    description: "At the top of the Xcode window, there's a little view that shows build progress. As of the new build system, this view includes fine-grained reporting of how many steps are remaining, and the progress bar reflects this as well. This makes it easier to see how a build is progressing.\r\n\r\nHowever, when running a build script phase, there is no fine-grained reporting available, as far as I know. The particular use case I've got in mind is Running Muter, a mutation testing tool: https://github.com/SeanROlszewski/muter. Muter necessarily runs slowly, because it must rebuild the project many times with slight changes, but its normal command-line log output includes progress in terms of (steps completed / total steps). It would be nice if Muter could expose this progress information to the build log in a way that Xcode would present it in the progress UI.\r\n\r\nScreenshot also posted to https://cl.ly/6c5a2afdd056\r\n\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61) on macOS 10.14.3 (18D109)"
