    description: "Duplicate of 16300505.\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nUIButton would benefit greatly from proper support for different background colors per UIControl state.\r\n\r\nA very common design for buttons is a button with a background color. However, to do this properly, the background color should change or update itself according to the UIControl state of the button. For example, a button could have a blue background for its normal state and a grey background for its disabled state.\r\n\r\nCurrently, that's hard to do, causing developers to misuse the background image functionality instead, often causing some other things to work less well. \r\n\r\nProposed API:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen func UIButton.setBackgroundColor(_ color: UIColor, for controlState: UIControl.State)\r\nopen func UIButton.backgroundColor(for controlState: UIControl.State)\r\n```"
