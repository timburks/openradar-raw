    description: "At the moment, there are no documented, acceptable ways to open specific views within the system Settings app. Currently, it is possible to use\r\n\r\nlet url = URL(string: \"App-Prefs:root=General\")\r\nUIApplication.shared.openUrl(url, options: [:]) { _ in }\r\n\r\nBut this has caused apps to be rejected for using a non-public urls and not all submenus within the Settings app are available.\r\n\r\nOne scenario where this is beneficial is if we notice an issue with the user's Touch ID or Face ID settings when they give positive intent to use Touch ID or Face ID in our app. We don't need to take any action for the user necessarily. However, it would greatly improve the user's experience to take them directly there instead of give them instructions on how to get there since the user would need to manually exit our app and return on their own."
