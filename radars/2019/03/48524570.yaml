    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPer https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201389:\r\n\r\n1. Spend any store credit remaining on your Apple ID. You must also wait for any pending store credit refunds to process before you can change your country or region. Learn what to do if your remaining store credit is less than the cost of a single item.\r\n2. Cancel any subscriptions, including Apple Music, and wait until the end of the subscription period to change your country or region. You'll also have to wait for any memberships, pre-orders, iTunes movie rentals, or Season Passes to complete.\r\n\r\nThis is just terrible. You may need to spend store credit buying items that you don’t want and cancel your subscriptions. Not only that, but you need to wait them to expire, which may take A FULL YEAR if you have a yearly subscription (like Apple Music offers).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Subscribe to Apple Music for 1 year to listen to music offline during your flight\r\n2. Move abroad\r\n3. Try to download an app that is only available in that country (let’s say your new bank app)\r\n4. You can’t, need to change your Apple ID country\r\n5. You can’t change your Apple ID country for ONE YEAR because of this stupid restriction \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou can change the country. \r\n\r\nI’d be ok with having to cancel the subscriptions, but I’d expect a partial refund based on how long my subscriptions would last. \r\n\r\nHowever, the first restriction (about store credits) would have to be removed as well for this to be useful. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou can’t use important apps (banking, etc) for a full year because of this.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12.1"
