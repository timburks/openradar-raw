    description: "Summary:\r\nIf there is a leap day within the next or prior 365 days, the Solar System watch face doesn’t correctly handle the date which is 365 days in the future.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be within 365 days of a leap day (the closest at the time of writing is February 29th, 2020!).\r\n2. Add the “Astronomy” watch face, with the “Solar System” variation.\r\n3. Rotate the Digital Crown until you are 364 days in the future, observe the state of the watch face.\r\n4. Rotate the Digital Crown one detent, so that the date is now 365 days in the future. Observe the state of the watch face.\r\n5. Rotate the Digital Crown one further detent, so the date is now 366 days in the future. Observe the state of the watch face.\r\n\r\nIf the nearest leap day is within the past 365 days, follow the above instructions but go that number of days into the past. Also invert the results below.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe watch face should read “+364 DAYS,” “+1 YEAR” and “+1 YEAR” at steps 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe watch face reads “+364 DAYS,” “+0 YEARS” and “+1 YEAR” at steps 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\r\n\r\nAttached screenshots IMG_1971, IMG_1972 and IMG_1973 show each of the above.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n5.1.3 (16S535)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Series 4, 40mm Aluminium"
