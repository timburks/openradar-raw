    description: "An NSAttributedString containing inline images displays fine in an NSTextView.\r\nBut drawn with NSAttributedString drawAtPoint: it draws incorrectly. If the view is\r\nset to FLIPPED, then the images are drawn, but the text is drawn over the top of\r\nthem (as if the images are in the background and take up no room). If the view is\r\nset to NOT FLIPPED, then the images are not drawn at all (or if they are drawn,\r\nthey are not drawn anywhere visible)."
