    description: "My home screen has a lot of apps. Sometimes an app receives a push notification and I don't even know that app exists on my phone. I want to delete that app for good but I don't know where the app is on my home screen. It may be inside some folder, which makes it even harder to find.\r\n\r\nI search in Spotlight and found the app. But the app icon there doesn't allow me to long press and delete it. It is annoying...\r\n\r\nI think the only way to delete the app is to find it on home screen, long press until the app wiggles, and then tap \"x\" to delete. There should be a better way to do this. \r\n\r\nOne idea is to add long press/force touch to app result in spotlight, which will open a menu. Add one menu action to move to a page on home screen where that app is and highlight it.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nApple replied and say it's a duplicate of 8229446 (https://openradar.appspot.com/29511246).\r\nWhich in that radar, it's a duplicate of 45464735, which I can't find in openradar."
