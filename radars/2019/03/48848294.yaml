    description: "In versions of macOS before macOS Mojave (10.14), one could press the Alt/Option key when viewing an image in Quick Look to zoom in to the \"actual size\" of the photo. And simply release the key to zoom back to \"zoom to fit\" size.\r\n\r\nThese shortcuts no longer work in the current version of Mojave. One must now use Command + 0 and Command + 9 to achieve that behavior, which is a much worse user experience. It is also not possible to overwrite those keyboard shortcut in System Preferences to restore the missing functionality, so there is no apparent workaround.\r\n\r\nStripping away that very useful functionality is a huge step backwards in making Preview a handy tool for working with images. One must now consider third-party solutions for an effective image-viewing workflow. Please restore these simple but powerful shortcuts!"
