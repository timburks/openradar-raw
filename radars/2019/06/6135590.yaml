    description: On Catalina, every app has to ask for user permission every time it wants to save a file to any new folder under the user's home folder. This is an onerous and unnecessary requirement as the user already has the correct file system privileges set by the underlying Unix file system. This is going to seriously impact the workflows of power users, and provides no real added benefit. Please consider removing this feature, or at the very least, allowing administrators to disable it.
