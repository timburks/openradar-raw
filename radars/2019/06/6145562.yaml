    description: "Especially when introducing a new, modern new API for declarative UI, it's very disappointing to see, that assets are still connected by their name (as String) and not in a type safe way which would allow the compiler to check for type mismatches, typos and missing resources.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nstruct ContentView : View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        Image(\"image\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf there is no image with the name \"image\" in the Assets catalog or if the resource was renamed or named with a typo or whatever, the swift compiler doesn't throw an error (or warning) during build time. Only at run time the app will crash with an exception. Furthermore, there's no autocompletion for such resource name strings...\r\n\r\nInstead I would expect something like the R.swift project already does for iOS 12 and before: It generates a swift file with typed constants for all resources and developers use these constants (and/or several generated convenience funcs) to  refer to resources. That way, removing or renaming a resource will result in a build time compiler error since the constant used in the source code doesn't exist anymore in the generated file.\r\nSee also: https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThere should be a type safe way to declare (Image-) resources in Swift UI. Be it by a build-time generated constants file, which contains type safe constants for each resource in a projects Assets catalogs. The Image class should provide a constructor for these constants and the constructor taking a string name should be deprecated. Have a look at R.swift (see above) for a nicely working example how this could be done and how it should work natively in Xcode with SwiftUI."

    title: Image objects are created with a String name. This is neither type save nor does it prevent runtime crashes due to typos or renaming of assets.
