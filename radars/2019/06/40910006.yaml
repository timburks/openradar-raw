The device requires resetting to work again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the app with a simulated location from a GPX file. Detach the debugger or unplug the cable. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSImulation should end as soon as running ends\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLocation remains stuck in simulated position\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4 and Xcode 9.4"
