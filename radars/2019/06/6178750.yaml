    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nI'd like to write tools to manage my iOS projects as Swift executables managed with SPM. It is often necessary to know the source directory for the project in order to do this, for example to run xcodebuild with Process to build the workspace located in SRCROOT.\r\n\r\nWhen running an iOS app in Xcode, it's possible to set environment variables that will be set, like SRCROOT = $(SRCROOT). This will be expanded and the app will have access to the expected value via ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment. When running an SPM package's executable in Xcode, this same UI is available to set environment variables but SRCROOT is not set. A possible workaround is to use #file in the executable source and navigate up the file's path hierarchy until you reach the SRCROOT path, but this is fragile.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nRunning the following from the attached iOS project:\r\n```\r\n        print(FileManager.default.currentDirectoryPath)\r\n        print(ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment[\"SRCROOT\"])\r\n```\r\nresults in the following output:\r\n```\r\n/\r\nOptional(\"/Users/brandon/Downloads/SPMTest\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the same from the Deploy SPM executable results in the following output:\r\n```\r\n/Users/brandon/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SPMTest-gbveyfcqhmdjkhfbxgfmuurogubg/Build/Products/Debug\r\nOptional(\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expected SRCROOT to be set when running the SPM executable, or a similar mechanism to be available to provide this value.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nIt was not set."
