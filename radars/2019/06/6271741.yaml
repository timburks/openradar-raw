    description: "Using SwiftUI to place a PresentationButton inside of a NavigationBarItem doesn't work correctly. The app will display the modal view once, but then never again. And if a modal has been displayed already, it won't even work once.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nstruct MainView : View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        NavigationView {\r\n            VStack {\r\n                Text(\"Main View\")\r\n                PresentationButton(destination: ModalView()) {\r\n                    Text(\"Open\") // Button 1\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            .navigationBarItems(trailing:\r\n                PresentationButton(destination: ModalView()) {\r\n                    Text(\"Open\") // Button 2\r\n                }\r\n            )\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct ModalView : View {\r\n    @Environment(\\.isPresented) private var isPresented\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            Text(\"Modal View\")\r\n            Button(action: dismiss) {\r\n                Text(\"Dismiss\")\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func dismiss() {\r\n        isPresented?.value = false\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nFull sample project here:\r\nhttps://github.com/DaveWoodCom/SwiftUIExperiments/tree/e60adf296585c0a478833f5b8a011cee5a40cdef\r\n\r\nThis sample shows that Button 1 works every time. While Button 2 will only work the first time it's pressed, if it's pressed first. It never presents the modal view a second time, even if Button 1 presented the modal view first.\r\n\r\nThis was tested with Xcode 11 Version 11.0 beta 2 (11M337n)"
