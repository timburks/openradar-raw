    description: "Xcode 11 allows the configure the Test plans to configure the testing layers. This is great feature to configure the tests independent of the schemes. However, there are address sanitizer and thread sanitizer can be enabled at the same time. \r\n\r\nOn the docs \"Address Sanitizer and Thread Sanitizer cannot be turned ON at the same time\" \r\nNot sure its changed recently, if not testplan should check if conflicting sanitizers are enabled."
