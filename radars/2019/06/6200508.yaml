    description: "Xcode does not show code coverage in swift package manager (package.swift)\r\n\r\nWhen opening a swift package by double clicking package.swift file Xcode does not show code coverage.\r\n**Please note that I am not using an Xcode project just a package with a package.swift file**\r\n\r\nStep to reproduce\r\n1. Use a random swift package with a test in it. (`swift package init`) \r\n2. Double click package.swift to open in Xcode 11\r\n3. Run the tests\r\n4. Code coverage is NOT shown.\r\n\r\nEven changing \"Hide Code Coverage\" or \"Show Code Coverage\" in the menu button \"Adjust Editor options\" seems to not work for swift packages."
