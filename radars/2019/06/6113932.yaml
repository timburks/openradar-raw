    description: "Please describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n- Enable FileVault with either a script or a signed Authorization Plugin written in Swift \r\n- User is presented with a confusing dialog box allowing them to not enable FileVault I would like this to be able to be suppressed with a profile delivered by MDM\r\n\r\nPlease describe the business impact, if any, of the issue you are reporting\r\nThis will prevent us from deploying macOS 10.15 on X devices as users are able to choose not to enable FileVault. This is likely to drive adoption of alternative platforms."
