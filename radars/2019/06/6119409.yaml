    description: "Pre-requisites \r\n- Add second international keyboard \r\n- Password AutoFill was enabled in iCloud \r\n- Associated Domains and AutoFill Credential Provider capabilities are disabled \r\n- The app is not trying to use AutoFill feature \r\n\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce the bug are listed below in given when then (BDD) format. \r\n\r\nGiven I select a textfield which has a content type set to email \r\nWhen the textfield becomes first responder, the German keyboard is displayed -- this works \r\nNext, I select a textfield which has content type set to password and secureEntryText to true \r\nThen I should see the German keyboard -- this step fails. I\r\nnstead, the keyboard disappears for a second and then a mix English/German keyboard is displayed. \r\n\r\nThis is 100% reproducible if the view controller class name includes the work \"register\" \r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that the system is trying to present the AutoFill password keyboard and fails because AutoFill password is not configured properly. This error is not handled properly and a mix English/German keyboard is displayed. I expect the system to display the previously selected international keyboard in this case the German one. \r\n\r\nI have uploaded sample code and attached screenshots in this publicly available repository - https://github.com/harmeetsingh/InternationalKeyboardsBug"
