    description: I saw that offline FairPlay is not supported in macOS, but is on iOS. We develop an app for professionals in the movie industry and are moving to using FairPlay DRM for our offline playback feature. However, we have a Mac app as well. So, we were really looking forward to supporting the feature on iOS and macOS. It would be very helpful if this could be implemented on macOS. Otherwise, we canâ€™t provide the feature on Mac.
