    description: "When configured a certain way, a UITextView will crash when using its tokenizer.\r\nA sample project that reproduced this crash is included in this report.  To reproduce the crash, simply run the code and click on the ellipsis (\"...\") at the end of the presented text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Extend a UITextView and add the following override: \r\noverride func point(inside point: CGPoint, with event: UIEvent?) -> Bool {\r\n        guard let position = closestPosition(to: point) else { return false }\r\n        \r\n        // Crash occurs here. However it happens on a seperate thread so the\r\n        // stack trace is difficult to debug as it has no reference to this line.\r\n        guard let range = tokenizer.rangeEnclosingPosition(position, with: .character, inDirection: UITextDirection.layout(.left)) else { return false }\r\n        \r\n        let startIndex = offset(from: beginningOfDocument, to: range.start)\r\n        \r\n        return attributedText.attribute(NSAttributedString.Key.link, at: startIndex, effectiveRange: nil) != nil\r\n }\r\n\r\n2. Configure your UITextView as such:\r\n        textView.isScrollEnabled = false\r\n        textView.isEditable = false\r\n        textView.textContainer.maximumNumberOfLines = 3\r\n        textView.textContainer.lineBreakMode = .byTruncatingTail\r\n\r\n3. Add text to the text view that goes beyond 3 lines. Such as:\r\n\"Hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms, for jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out , who's the baby, so i am the best but throw down all the stuff in the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd doing this:\r\n\r\nRun the code and click on the ellipsis (\"...\") at the end of the text."
