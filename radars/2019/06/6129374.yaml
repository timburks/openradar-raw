    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\n\r\n1. When using the new Feedback system https://feedbackassistant.apple.com, all new lines seem to be stripped. So instead of you receiving the bug report laid out in a clear manner, you get everything jumbled together in one holy long paragraph.\r\n(2x Newline Here) \r\n\r\n2. In this bug report for example, I'm numbering each paragraph, and letting you know where I've added a newline. So you can see how the bug report was entered, verses how you're receiving it.\r\n(2x Newline Here)\r\n\r\n3. Hopefully this is something you can fix, as it makes it difficult for us to read the bug report later, so it must be awful for you.\r\n(Newline Here)\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Sent this bug report.\r\n(2x Newline Here)\r\n\r\n2. That is all.\r\n(Newline Here)\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\n1. I expected each paragraph to remain its own paragraph.\r\n(2x Newline Here)\r\n\r\n2. These paragraphs have fought their whole lives to remain independent, it's probably against some constitution somewhere that they be forced together like common gibberish.\r\n(Newline Here)\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n\r\n1. All of the paragraphs where smushed together like grapes being made into wine.\r\n(Newline Here)"
