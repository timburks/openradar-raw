    description: 'Since macOS 10.14.3 (unaware if this was due to the update to that version or introduced sometime between 10.14.3 & 10.14.4), if a link is opened via the favorites section (either in a new tab or when clicking the address bar on an open webpage and opening it through there) it will cause the CSS :hover state not to fire. You must go directly to the URL without interacting with the Favorites section to have it work properly. Steps to Reproduce: 1) Open a new page via the Favorites view on a new tab or clicking on the address bar on an open webpage. 2) Hover over an element that has a known defined CSS hover state. Expected Results: The CSS hover state should fire as expected. Actual Results: The CSS hover state will not fire as intended.'
