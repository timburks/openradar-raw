    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nIn an app targeting versions < iOS 13, implementing `UIViewControllerRepresentable` and `PreviewProvider` always results in a crash in the Canvas preview.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nImplement `UIViewControllerRepresentable` and `PreviewProvider` from SwiftUI in an extension, using @available(iOS 13, *) for the conforming extension. Ensure the app targets iOS 11 (or anything below 13). Attempt to view the preview canvas.\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nPreview works even though app target targets iOS 11.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nPreview crashes with “'MainScreenViewControllerPreviews' is only available in iOS 13 or newer”. Swift generated extension doesn’t include @available(iOS 13, *), which causes a crash. Modifying the app’s deployment targets all to iOS 13 avoids the crash, but I assume it’s unintended behavior to have to keep changing my deployment target just to try out a non-deployment-related preview feature."
