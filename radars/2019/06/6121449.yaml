    description: "-  have an image in the application bundle\r\n - in a background thread use imagedNamed: to access the image\r\n - background the app. \r\nexpected:\r\n imageNamed should never return nil for images that are bundled with the app \r\nactual:\r\n sometimes it returns nil when access on a background thread when the app is backgrounded. Be aware - I am using the word \"background\" twice in two different contexts - it is not a mistake or confusion. \r\nNote: this does not seem to reproduce when using initWithContentsOfFile:\r\n this does not seem to reproduce when the images are stored in a asset catalog \r\nWe talked to Tony from the foundation team about this at WWDC 2019"
