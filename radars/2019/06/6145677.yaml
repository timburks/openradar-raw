    description: "A common approach to select one of multiple options, is to present a `UIAlertController` action sheet and show all available options there. A checkmark is often used to indicate the currently selected option. This can be seen in Apple's own Podcast app, for example. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is no API for the checkmark at this moment. Instead, the developer has to do the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\nalertAction.setValue(true, forKey: \"checked\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor iOS 13, it would be great to see official support for this behaviour. For example;\r\n\r\n```\r\nalertAction.checked = true\r\n```"
