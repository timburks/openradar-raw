    description: "FB6170422\r\n\r\nThe first row animates away and then both the new row and the old first row animate in. See first half of attached video of tapping + button.\r\n\r\nLaunch the attached project in Xcode 11b2, iPhone 8 Plus Portrait simulator. Tap the add button a few times.\r\n\r\nAlso didChangeContentWithSnapshot snapshot is not including the reload items. If you click the Update button where it updates the timestamp of the last item in the list (so it moves to top) however it does not show the new time because the cell was not reloaded (see second half of video tapping update button). Uncomment out MasterViewController line 52 to see the expected behaviour where I added the reload item to the snapshot myself."
