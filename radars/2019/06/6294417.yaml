    description: "When setting NSImageView.image to a large image with high dimension (like 19200*10800), the whole system will freeze.\r\nThis issue does not happen on old macOS versions, or machines with other graphics card (like Intel HD Graphics 6000).\r\nBut with macOS 10.14.5 + Intel Iris, this issue will happen."
