    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nspctl rejects Xcode 11 beta 1 because of invalid symbolic link destination. After downloading and moving Xcode 11 beta 1 to /Applications/Xcode-11.0.0-beta.app and running `spctl --assess --verbose --type execute /Applications/Xcode-11.0.0-beta.app`, the following result is shown: `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app: rejected (invalid destination for symbolic link in bundle)`. https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2206/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007919-CH1-TNTAG208\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Downloading and move Xcode 11 beta 1 to /Applications/Xcode-11.0.0-beta.app 2. Run `spctl --assess --verbose --type execute /Applications/Xcode-11.0.0-beta.app` 3. Observe: `/Applications/Xcode-11.0.0-beta.app: rejected (invalid destination for symbolic link in bundle)`. A colleague reproduced this result on their computer as well. I'm running 10.14.4 (18E226)\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI also have Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) installed and it is approved by spctl. I would expect Xcode 11 to also be approved by spctl based on this experience and my general (potentially incorrect) understanding of Gatekeeper's functionality.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nXcode 11 was rejected by spctl."
