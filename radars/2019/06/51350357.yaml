    description: "Summary:\r\nVery often, mostly on the first deployment try each day, as I try to deploy on my iPhone I get the following error:\r\n„Development cannot be enabled while your device is locked\r\nPlease unlock your device and reattach. (0xE80000E2)”\r\niPhone is connected via Lightning cable and unlocked. Restarting Xcode, locking and unlocking the iPhone and disconnecting and reattaching the device (in any combination), does not solve the problem.\r\nI have to reboot my Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs it often happens in the morning, I guess, returning from sleep could be a step to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConnecting the device and unlocking should enable deployment.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe error will not disappear.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXocde 10.1 / Xocde 10.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\ndefault"
