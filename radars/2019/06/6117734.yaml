    description: "Assertion in [UITableView _visibleCellsUsingPresentationValues]\r\n\r\nBug number on Feedback Assistance FB6117734\r\n\r\nThe issue occurred in new iOS 13 beta. \r\nFor iOS 12 everything works fine.\r\n When I run my app I'm getting crash. \r\n\r\nThere is a warning right before the assertion appears: \r\n[TableView] Warning once only: UITableView was told to layout its visible cells and other contents without being in the view hierarchy (the table view or one of its superviews has not been added to a window). This may cause bugs by forcing views inside the table view to load and perform layout without accurate information (e.g. table view bounds, trait collection, layout margins, safe area insets, etc), and will also cause unnecessary performance overhead due to extra layout passes. Make a symbolic breakpoint at UITableViewAlertForLayoutOutsideViewHierarchy to catch this in the debugger and see what caused this to occur, so you can avoid this action altogether if possible, or defer it until the table view has been added to a window. Table view: <GDEasyActivationTableView: 0x10b00d000; baseClass = UITableView; frame = (-1 75; 377 88); clipsToBounds = YES; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x28234ed00>; layer = <CALayer: 0x282d0b540>; contentOffset: {0, 0}; contentSize: {377, 88}; adjustedContentInset: {0, 0, 0, 0}; dataSource: <GDEProvisionViewController: 0x10b005a00>> 2019-06-05 10:24:11.546159+0300 GreetingsClient[442:39702] [BBD] DBG Reachability Flag Status: -R ------- networkStatusForFlags 2019-06-05 10:24:11.546282+0300 GreetingsClient[442:39400] *** Assertion failure in -[GDEasyActivationTableView _visibleCellsUsingPresentationValues:], /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.appl Environment: iOS 13 iPhone X The code snippet which causes the crash is in attachements\r\nTerminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Attempted to access the table view's visibleCells while they were in the process of being updated, which is not allowed."
