    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nAttempting to delete an SPM dependency in the package navigator does nothing in Xcode 11 beta 1\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Add an SPM dependency to an app project with File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.... E.g. https://github.com/Quick/Nimble\r\n2. Wait for the package to resolve and be checked out, so that it's listed with a version in the package navigator. E.g. Nimble (8.0.2)\r\n3. The Edit > Delete (command + delete) menu item and Delete contextual menu item are both active. Click either.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expect Delete in the Edit menu and contextual menu to either not be available or to perform a similar action as when removing an SPM dependency from a project's Swift Packages list.\r\n\r\n{What actually happened?\r\nNothing happens."
