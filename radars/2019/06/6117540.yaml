    description: "SwiftUI was released at WWDC 19 and looks like the future of UI on Apple platforms. It is everything that's modern in UI programming: FRP, reactive extensions, diffable views, live previews and more.\r\n\r\nIt's useful for all app developers, but it's most useful for developers of large popular apps. Large apps have many features to appeal to a large user base, and iterate on them frequently to improve them. The new paradigm saves time, and that time saving gets bigger the more features you have.\r\n\r\nWhen adopting new OS features, it is common to gate them with availability clauses. However, when developing core app UI, this isn't usually possible.\r\n\r\nLarge apps would be the last to adopt SwiftUI, because of backwards compatibility. For the same reasons of broad appeal, popular apps usually support several older versions of an operating system. This does not allow for using SwiftUI for several years to come. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, SwiftUI should be made to support older iOS versions.\r\n\r\nThere is ample precedent for this - Android support libraries, and in Apple's own space, the Swift support library, which was decoupled from the user app only recently."
