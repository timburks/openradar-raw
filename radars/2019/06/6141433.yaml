    description: "When starting up in Single User Mode, by holding down cmd-S, macOS 10.15 beta (19A471t) shows the message:\r\n\r\nTo mount the root device as read-write:\r\n    $ /bin/mount -X /\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the mount command does not know about the X option, so this command is not working.\r\n\r\nThe macOS system was installed from scratch, not as a upgrade from 10.14."
