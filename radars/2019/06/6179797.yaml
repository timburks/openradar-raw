    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nGiven a property with a property wrapper, renaming it with either the Edit All in Scope or Refactor > Rename features causes all uses of the property name to be correctly renamed, but any $-prefixed uses of the property name (referencing the wrapper itself) are not renamed. This causes errors that are especially hard to understand when the now-invalid $-prefixed property name is used within the SwiftUI DSL, because the error messages tend to be something like \"Cannot convert value of type LargeGenericType to closure result type ‘_’”.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nGiven a SwiftUI View struct like:\r\n```\r\nstruct MyView: View {\r\n    @ObjectBinding var viewModel = MyViewModel()\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        HStack {\r\n            Text(self.viewModel.isLocked ? \"Unlock\" : \"Lock\")\r\n            Toggle(isOn: self.$viewModel.isLocked, label: { Text(\"\") })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Place the cursor within `viewModel` on the second line and choose Editor > Edit All in Scope, or Editor > Refactor > Rename...\r\n- Give it a new name\r\n- Note that the use of viewModel in the Text declaration was renamed, but the use of $viewModel in the Toggle declaration has not been renamed\r\n\r\nSee the attached sample project for code you can try this with.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nBoth plain and $-prefixed uses of properties with property wrappers would be renamed by Edit All in Scope and Refactor > Rename.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nNeither properly renames $-prefixed uses of the property."
