    description: "Product version: iOS 13.0 beta (17A5492t)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen accessing the system font via UIFont.systemFont(ofSize:weight:), the font will often be rendered in Times New Roman instead of the expected SF font face. This does not occur when accessing the font directly by name instead, e.g. UIFont(name: \"SFUIText-Regular\", size: 16). \r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\nWhile we were unable to determine exact conditions to reproduce, we found the issue occurs primarily where we are accessing fonts declared as named static constants. Furthermore, we were also able to reproduce this in a playground by using the system accessor name to instantiate the font like this: UIFont(name: \".SFUI-Regular\", size: 14)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe font returned is in the SF system typeface, or nil is returned if an improper font name is passed in.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nThe font returned is Times New Roman in a size that matches the size passed in."
