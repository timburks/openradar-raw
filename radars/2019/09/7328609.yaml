    description: "I use a Mac, an iPhone SE 128 GB & an iPad (5th generation) 128 GB, all running on latest stable versions of their operating systems:\r\n- the Mac is on macOS 10.14.6 (18G103)\r\n- the iPhone & the iPad are on iOS/iPadOS 13.1\r\n\r\nBefore I updated the iPhone & the iPad to iOS/iPadOS 13.x, notes were syncing correctly. After I updated the iPhone to iOS 13.0, often the changes made to a note on my Mac didn't sync to the iPhone, requiring me to do another modification of the note on a Mac before all the changes were flushed. When I updated iPhone to iOS 13.1, the problem persisted. I then updated iPad to iPadOS 13.1 & the problem started appearing there as well so it's definitely OS-related. I'm afraid when Catalina gets stable & I'll upgrade, I'll start seeing the same issue on the Mac."
