    description: "Xcode syntax highlighting based on `.xclangspec` files in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications/` does not work in Xcode 11. \r\n\r\nTo get syntax highlighting in Xcode 11 to work you have to drop stuff directly into the `SourceModel.framework` folder *within* Xcode, which seems mega-fragile.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode 10.3. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Install plugin via the instructions here https://github.com/apollographql/xcode-graphql#manual-installation on Xcode 10.3 (specifically, the `cp GraphQL.xclangspec ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications/` bit.\r\n2. Have syntax highlighting work great for .graphql files\r\n3. Install plugin via the same instructions on Xcode 11.0\r\n4. No syntax highlighting for graphql files. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nSyntax highlighting from `xclangspec` files provided in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications` should continue to work in new versions of Xcode, or instructions for migration should be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n\r\nI needed to use a workaround found in [this dev forums thread](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/122901) to get syntax highlighting to work. \r\n\r\nBasically I moved the `xclangspec` to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/SourceModel.framework/Versions/A/Resources/LanguageSpecifications`  and created a brand new `Xcode.SourceCodeLanguage.GraphQL.plist file (basically copying the existing js one) in ``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/SourceModel.framework/Versions/A/Resources/LanguageMetadata`. \r\n\r\nThis seems fragile as hell though, so it'd be nice to know if there's a better way."
