    description: "When using UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning to provide a custom transition animation on iOS 13.0 GM and iOS 13.1 beta 3, the transition context's view(forKey:) method is incorrectly returning nil under certain circumstances. I have verified the behavior on both simulators and devices.\r\n\r\nIt appears this is happening for view(forKey: .from) when the presenting view controller is being presented non-modally. When dismissing a view controller that was originally presented from a non-modal view controller, the result of view(forKey: .to) is also nil. \r\n\r\nBy non-modally, I mean that I have confirmed this behavior with iPad form sheets and popovers, and the new default sheet-style presentation on iPhone in iOS 13.\r\n\r\nI don't see anything in the documentation that indicates this is an intended change in behavior. \r\n\r\nA workaround is to use the root view controller of view controller returned by viewController(forKey:) method, although the documentation explicitly discourages that: \"The view returned by this method may or may not be the root view of the corresponding view controller.\" (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontrollercontexttransitioning/1622055-view)\r\n\r\nAnother manifestation of this issue seems to be that the finalFrame(for:) method returns an incorrect CGRect when asked what the final frame for this view controller should be. In my testing, it is returning a full-screen rect, even though the correct view is smaller.\r\n\r\nI have provided a sample project that illustrates the issue. To reproduce the issue, launch the app on an iPad simulator, tap the \"Present Sheet\" button, and then tap the \"Attempt Custom Transition\" button. Then, look at the debug output. When running on iOS 12, you will see the output \"From view DOES exist\", whereas on iOS 13, you will see the output \"From view does NOT exist\".\r\n\r\nSample project: https://github.com/clindsay/TestTransitionBug"
