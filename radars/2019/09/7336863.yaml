    description: "- Create a subclass of UITextView\r\n- Override “textInputMode” and have it return one of the “UITextInputMode.activeInputModes”\r\n- Expect the keyboard for the given input mode to open\r\n- See the system keyboard open instead.\r\n\r\nThis was working until iOS 13. It seems to be fine in iOS 12.\r\n\r\nThis is being built on a slightly older version of — Xcode Version 10.2.1 (10E1001)\r\nBeing run on an iPhone X, iOS 13.1.1 (17A854), but getting reports from multiple users on multiple devices for this issue.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample project that illustrates the problem: https://github.com/cjwirth/radars/tree/master/keyboard-sadness"
