    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nThere is no way to select a different bank account or add a new bank account in the “Banking” section of App Store connect. The place you have to look for it is goofy enough that I sat on hold with developer support for five minutes while *they* had to figure it out.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Decide to close bank account currently on App Store Connect\r\n2. Log into app store connect to change bank account\r\n3. Go to Agreements, Tax, And Banking > Banking\r\n4. Be able to delete non-“In use” accounts and see what account is in use, but not be able to add a new account or switch which account is “in use”. \r\n5. Call support because this makes no sense\r\n6. Sit on hold with support while they try to figure it out too\r\n7. Have support tell me I have to go to Agreements, Tax, And Banking > Agreements > Paid Apps > Bank Accounts\r\n8. Have that work\r\n9. File a radar because that’s super-silly. \r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI should be able to add, edit, or switch the primary account in the Banking tab in addition to viewing and deleting the non-primary account.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nChanging or adding a bank account must be done through going to Agreements, Tax, And Banking > Agreements > Paid Apps > Bank Accounts"
