    description: My app uses custom fonts and has a variety of different color themes. In order to make them work with iOS 13 Context Menus, I need a way to apply my fonts and colors to those menus. I was able to change menu item (individual UIAction) colors with the appearance manager, but I cannot find a way to apply colors to the separator lines between UIActions or to UIMenus displayed inline. I also was not able to change the font used by UIAction titles.
