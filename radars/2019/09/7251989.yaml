    description: "In Catalyst builds with Xcode GM seed running on Catalina beta 8, dynamic system colors .label, .systemBackground and .systemSecondaryBackground that are set in Storyboard do not adapt to dark mode on macOS.   They should, but they don't.  They do adapt properly to dark mode on iOS, but not on Catalina beta 8 through Catalyst.   A workaround is to have an outlet for every label, text field and background view, and to explicitly set the text color and background color in code.  This works and suggests that the problem in not entirely with the dynamic system colors but rather has something to do with how they are being set when specified in Storyboard and building with Catalyst. \r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nIn Storyboard set a color to .label, .systemBackground or .secondarySystemBackground.  \r\nBuild for macOS through Catalyst.\r\nSet dark mode on macOS.\r\nThe colors do not change to their dark mode values.\r\nRepeat but set the colors in code.\r\nNow the colors adapt to their dark mode values.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nColors set in Storyboard should adapt to dark mode.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nColors set in Storyboard did not adapt to dark mode."
