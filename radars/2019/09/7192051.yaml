    description: "When linking a binary framework as a dependency of a Swift package, if the binary framework is the product of an Xcode project, placing the Swift package and the Xcode project under the same Xcode workspace should be enough to build the Swift package successfully. Instead,  \"Find Implicit Dependencies\" is not working, and building the Swift package fails with the error \"No such module 'XcodeProjectDependency'\".\r\n\r\nI created an example repository here: https://github.com/acecilia/FindImplicitDependenciesBug\r\nFor more context see: https://forums.swift.org/t/binary-frameworks-with-swiftpm/26225/8\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1- Create a Swift package with a target that links a binary framework: `linkerSettings: [.linkedFramework(\"XcodeProjectDependency\")]`\r\n2- Create an Xcode project with a target named `XcodeProjectDependency`\r\n3- Put them both under the same Xcode workspace.\r\n\r\nExpectation:\r\nDue to the \"Find Implicit Dependencies\" setting being on, building the swift package should succeed, as Xcode should detect that it depends on the `XcodeProjectDependency` target.\r\n\r\nReality:\r\nBuilding the Swift package fails with the error \"No such module 'XcodeProjectDependency'\"."
