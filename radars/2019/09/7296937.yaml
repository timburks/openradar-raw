    description: "Problem:\r\n\r\nWhen a view controller gets presented modally as a sheet, the `UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate`'s `presentationControllerDidDismiss` only gets called during pull-to-dismiss. It does not get called when the view controller gets dismissed programmatically. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nUnzip the attached file and run the playground. Click the `Present` button in the middle of the screen which should present another view controller as a sheet. Pull-to-dismiss the view controller and `dismissed controller` will be printed out in the console. This signifies that `presentationControllerDidDismiss` was called. Click `Present` again to create the view controller again. Click `Done` on the top right of the new screen and notice that `dismissed controller` was not called this time.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n\r\nI expected that `dismissed controller` is printed in both cases (when pulled-to-dismiss and when dismissing through the `Done` button).\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n\r\n`dismissed controller` is only printed when pulled-to-dismiss."
