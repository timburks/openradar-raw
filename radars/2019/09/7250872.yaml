    description: "Problem:\r\nOn iOS 13 GM Seed (17A577), applying a transform ramp to an `AVAsset` using `AVMutableVideoCompositionLayerInstruction.setTransformRamp(fromStart:toEnd:timeRange:)` does nothing. This currently works on iOS 12.4.1 and below.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n- We’ve filed our initial bug report regarding this issue here: FB7076739\r\n- This bug was fixed in the iOS 13.1 beta (17A5837a), but was not fixed in the iOS 13 GM Seed (17A577)\r\n- We found another person facing this issue here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/120946\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project on iOS 13 GM Seed (17A577).\r\n1. Tap the “Original” button, which will play the asset in its original form.\r\n2. Tap the “setTransform” button, which uses `setTransform(_:at:)` to apply a transformation (working as intended).\r\n3. Tap the “setTransformRamp” button, which uses `setTransformRamp(fromStart:toEnd:timeRange:)` to apply a transformation (NOT working as intended—no animation, no transformation on iOS 13). On iOS 12, you will see that the same code animates the transformation.\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\n`setTransformRamp(fromStart:toEnd:timeRange:)` applies (and animates) a transformation of `translationX: 200.0`, like it does for `setTransform(_:at:)`, and `setTransformRamp(fromStart:toEnd:timeRange:)` on iOS 12.4.\r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\nTransform does not apply at all (no animation, no transformation)."
