    description: "BACKGROUND:\r\nThe visibilitychange javascript notification allows a web developer to know if the user has stopped viewing a site and then returned to it. It allows script to run when the user returns to the site.\r\n\r\nBUG:\r\nIn iOS 13 Beta and iOS 13.1 Beta, If you save multiple sites to your home screen, opening one will fire the visibilitychange notification on all others that are still in the App Switcher (Previously opened) even though they are in the Hidden state.\r\nThis results in any previously opened web app to fire it's visibilitychange code thinking it is Visible even though the visibility of that page has not actually changed at all and it is Hidden.\r\n\r\nHOW TO REPRODUCE:\r\nI have created 2 web pages to demo this:\r\n\r\nhttp://venderbase.com/vischange.html\r\nA simple website that subscribes to the visibilitychange notification and updates the display to show that visibility had changed with the state and time.\r\n\r\nhttp://venderbase.com/nojs.html\r\nDoesn't do anything. It has no Javascript code whatsoever.\r\n\r\nNavigate to the above 2 websites and add them to the Home Screen from the Share menu.\r\nFrom the home screen, open the vischange website.\r\nFrom the home screen, open the nojs website.\r\nGo back to home screen and reopen nojs.\r\nGo back to home screen and reopen nojs.\r\nRepeat opening and closing nojs a few times.\r\nOpen vischange again and you will see that it's visibilitychange notification had been fired for every time you opened nojs even though visibility hadn't changed for vischange.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT:\r\nI have tested this using an iPhone 7 on iOS 13 Beta 5 through 8 and iOS 13.1 Beta 1"
