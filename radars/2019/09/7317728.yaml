    description: "In previous versions of the iOS SDK, an Xcode project could include the following two files in the app target and use imageNamed: to get the correct one for their device:\r\n\r\n- image~iphone.jpg\r\n- image~ipad.jpg\r\n\r\nThis behaviour changed with iOS 13 (even though the app in question could link against the iOS 12 SDK, or earlier). \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Create an iOS project with Xcode 10.\r\n- Add two identically-named images (except for ~iphone and ~ipad suffixes to distinguish between the device idioms).\r\n- Try loading the image on an iOS 13 device\r\n\r\nExpect results: you get the image.\r\n\r\nActual results: you get nil.\r\n\r\nI have created an Xcode project to recreate the bug (and I have verified that it works as expected on iOS 12 devices): https://github.com/ashfurrow/ios-13-uiimage-crash I will also attach the directory to this bug report."
