    description: "My VPN app defines a custom \"Extension type\" and a corresponding \"Imported UTI\" for .ovpn files. This way it can open .ovpn files and shows up as \"Copy to Passepartout\" in the menus. It has happily coexisted with other apps like OpenVPN Connect doing the same, until now.\r\n\r\nIt looks like as long as other apps handle the same file extension, only one of them appears as \"Copy to xxx\". In fact, if I uninstall OpenVPN Connect, my app does show up again as usual. If both are installed, only one of them appears. Mostly the other ones, but _not_ always.\r\n\r\nThis has never happened before iOS 13, so some behavior must have changed under the hood."
