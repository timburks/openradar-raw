    description: "Since iOS 13 beta, If you install a WebClip mobileconfig that uses a URL scheme as it's URL, it fails to open more than once.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nInstall the attached test.mobileconfig to a device running iOS 13 or iOS 13.1 and confirm installation through the Settings app.\r\nThis installs a home screen webclip that launches the Calendar app using it's URL Scheme: calshow:// (this bug happens with all URL schemes, but I chose calshow:// as it is present on all devices).\r\nPress the newly installed icon on the home screen and it opens and launches calendar.\r\nGo back to the home screen and press it again, it opens but stays on the blank fullscreen web app page.\r\nOnly when you remove it from the app switcher will it work again."
