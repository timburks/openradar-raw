    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working on a larger Objective-C project, interacting with a header file routinely crashes Xcode if the header contains collapsed documentation comments, due to an index out of bounds exception in `-[NSMutableRLEArray objectAtIndex:effectiveRange::]`.\r\n\r\nThe interactions include (but are not limited to) scrolling, clicking somewhere, moving the cursor, …\r\n\r\nIt is hard to overstate how annoying this is, and because I suspect that this is timing dependent, I have not attempted to reproduce this in a sample project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. in a larger Objective-C project — I guess something like DevToolsCore.framework will do — open a header file that contains multi-line documentation comments\r\n2. select the “Editor > Code Folding > Fold Comment Blocks” menu item or invoke the corresponding shortcut\r\n3. scroll, click, or move the cursor below a folded section a few times\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe source code editor scrolls, responds to the clicks, moves the cursor in a regular fashion\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWay more often than not, Xcode crashes with a stack trace like the one I’ve attached.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nFirst observed on Xcode 10.2 (10E125)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
