    description: "One of the main limitations of this framework has been the lack of a native way to add obstacle occlusions. \r\nYou can see a demo of such feature in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZrmPTPgY3I\r\n\r\nThe addition of occlusion is key to maintain the illusion of an immersive AR experience: having this feature in ARKit would improve greatly the AR experience of millions of users worldwide.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2019-05-16:\r\nMarked as duplicate of 44229311 (not available on Open Radar)"
