    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a regression in Xcode 10, from Xcode 9.\r\nVerified by using `sample`, the amount of time spent in xctestrun specification generation increases exponentially in number of configuration build directories (In Xcode 9.4 it increased roughly linearly).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload the attached repo, run `./build-for-testing.sh`, and observe that the `xcodebuild` invocation takes ~5 minutes to finish after the last build step has completed. (This can be verified by inspecting the xcactivitylog, which shows that compilation finishes well before `xcodebuild` returns).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`xcodebuild` should finish almost immediately after compilation has finished.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`xcodebuild` spends a long time generating the xctestrun file.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.2\r\n\r\nYou can see the exponentiality by running the script at https://gist.github.com/segiddins/8c530d91f0617a0bc9bf3180e9e1759b."
