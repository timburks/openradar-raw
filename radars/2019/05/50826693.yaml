    description: "Summary:\r\nThe text editor in Xcode 10 does not handle Control-T correctly, at least when it comes to the very important special case of Control-T at the end of the line.  In NSTextView fields, and in Emacs generally back to at least 1979 (when I first encountered it), Control-T at the end of the line exchanges the last two characters of the line; this is a special case, but much more useful than the alternative of exchanging the character at the end of the line with the newline, thereby moving the last character onto the following line.\r\n\r\nSadly, this is what the text editor in Xcode 10 does.  Not only is this behavior inconsistent and unexpected, but it has no inherent utility.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Xcode 10, open a new empty text file; type several characters (e.g. \"12345\"), then press control-T.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe last two characters in the line (in other words, the two characters before the insertion point) are exchanged. (In the preceding example, the result would be \"12354\".)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe last character in the line is moved to the start of the following line."
