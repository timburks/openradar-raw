    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen AppleTV has previously played audio on HomePod, this preference is not always remembered. \r\nIf HomePod is not playing audio already, then Apple TV should reconnect to the last HomePod it was connected to for audio playback of movies. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Turn on Apple TV and play a movie\r\n2) Select HomePod as audio output\r\n3) Finish watching and put Apple TV into standby\r\n4) After a while, wake up Apple TV and play a movie\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe audio should be coming from the previously selected homepod\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe audio plays on the TV instead of the HomePod. Likely if HomePod played other music in between TV sessions. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nApple TV 4K, v12.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHomePod v12.3"
