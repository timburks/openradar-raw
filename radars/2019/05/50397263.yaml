    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPresenting a `.formSheet` modal view controller that supports all / default orientations from a view controller that has `.portrait` as the only supported orientation can lead to a crash. This occurs only on devices that have a regular size class in Landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Note - original radar has a sample application attached, the following section has been modified to provide clarity on open radar without the sample application)\r\n\r\n- Create a single view application\r\n- Embed the main view controller within a navigation controller\r\n- Set the supported orientations of the main view controller as `.portrait`\r\n- Create another view controller - modal view controller\r\n- Leave the supported orientations of the modal view controller set to default (i.e. don't override it)\r\n- Add a button to the main view controller's view to trigger the presentation of the modal view controller with a `.formSheet` `modalPresentationStyle`\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n    @IBAction func didTapPresent(_ sender: UIButton) {\r\n        let modalViewController = ModalViewController()\r\n        modalViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .formSheet\r\n        present(modalViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Launch the sample application on a Plus device (or XS Max / XR)\r\n- Rotate the device / simulator to landscape\r\n- Tap the button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should not crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app crashes (hits an internal UIKit assert)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Assert] transitionViewForCurrentTransition is not set! (<_UIFullscreenPresentationController: 0x7ff9be4023d0>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n- iPhone 7 plus (iOS 12.1) / iPhone XS Max (iOS 12.1)\r\n- Xcode Version 10.2 (10E125)"
