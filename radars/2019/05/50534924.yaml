    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController's Empty Recent Screen has broken support for Dynamic Type:\r\n1. When changing font size, the font used on the empty recent screen is not changed in real time. It changes only after the app restarts\r\n2. The \"No Recents\" title and body is covered by navigation bar on smaller screens (iPhone SE) when larger font size is used (XXL) without any option to scroll the text to make it visible.\r\n\r\nSee the Screenshot.png in the attached zip file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open iPhone SE Simulator\r\n2. Set the Font Size in Accessibility Inspector to XXL\r\n3. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app (created from Xcode template)\r\n4. See the \"No Results\" texts\r\n5. Change the Font Size in Accessibility Inspector to XXL\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The font size of the \"No Results\" text changes as font size setting changes\r\n- The text is not covered by navigation bar and is scrollable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The font size of the \"No Results\" text does not change as font size setting changes\r\n- The text is covered by navigation bar and is not scrollable"
