    description: "Since Xcode 10, thanks to localizable strings dictionaries, we have the possibility to declare and use Variable Width Strings, where the actual content of our string varies based on the space available.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if we could use this for the app titles (the one displayed under the app icon in the springboard), too. This would end app titles being truncated when:\r\n- an app has been updated or is being tested because of the blue/orange dot indicator. \r\n- When the uses has large font size text preference turned on (accessibility feature)"
