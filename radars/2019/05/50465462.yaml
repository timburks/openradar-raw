    description: "Area:\r\nApp Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nExpanded App Store screenshots on iOS are stretched horizontally. The regular non expanded screenshots are fine and have the original aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nI attached multiple screenshots to demonstrate the issue.\r\nThe issue applies to App Store screenshots from all apps, not only Transit.\r\n\r\nIn IMG_0825.PNG, we can see that the \"175+ cities\" white circle is correctly sized.\r\nIn IMG_0826.PNG, we can see that the \"175+ cities\" white circle is stretched horizontally (its width is ~2.6% bigger than its height)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open any app in the App Store on iOS on an iPhone X (not sure if the issue applies to all screen sizes)\r\n- Look at the screenshots\r\n- Tap on a screenshot to get the expanded (larger) screenshots\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The expanded screenshots keep the original aspect ratio\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The expanded screenshots are stretched by 3% horizontally\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.2 & iOS 12.3 beta 4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X\r\n\r\nhttps://dsc.cloud/felix/IMG_0825.PNG\r\nhttps://dsc.cloud/felix/IMG_0826.PNG\r\nhttps://dsc.cloud/felix/app-store-stretch.png"
