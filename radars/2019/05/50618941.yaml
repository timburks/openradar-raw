    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere once was a time where Mac OS would not allow windows to steal focus. It was a glorious time where we all danced and celebrated and lived carefree lives. But, as all things unfortunately, dark clouds slowly crept in and soon enough windows began looting and rioting and stealing the focus from other windows. It's like living in the lawless times of the wild wild west, and frankly, we want our old sheriff back that would hold fast against such window-stealing bandits. Make Windows Great Again (MWGA!)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen more than one window at a time. Some notorious examples are Slack, and multiple projects in any IntelliJ editor - the latter being the most dizzying of them all (especially on multiple monitors).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhichever window has the focus, keeps the focus. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf you're an epileptic, or easily succumb to motion sickness, you end up vomiting all over your expensive Apple keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.4 (18E226), but has been around for quite a while now.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDefault, out of the box."
