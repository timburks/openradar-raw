    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt appears that creating a UIKeyCommand whose input is a period (\".\") and whose modifierFlags value is UIKeyModifierFlags.command does not work.\r\n\r\nI see that keyboard shortcuts whose input is UIKeyCommand.inputEscape gets called if the user presses command-period. I suspect that is related. Using UIKeyCommand.inputEscape could be an acceptable workaround, but if the user holds down the command key to see a list of keyboard shortcuts the shortcut listed is the escape key. That is not helpful to a customer with an Apple iPad keyboard that lacks an escape key.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Observe that the view controller adds two key commands that are identical except that one has a keyboard shortcut of command-period and the other has a keyboard shortcut of command-L.\r\n3. Run the attached sample project on an iPad with a hardware keyboard.\r\n4. Hit command-L on the keyboard several times, and see the app log a message to the console indicating that it received the key command.\r\n5. Hit command-period on the keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect hitting command-period to call handleKeyCommand, and for that to result in the following written to the console:\r\n\r\ngot key command -- input: Optional(\".\"), modifierFlags: UIKeyModifierFlags(rawValue: 1048576)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe handleKeyCommand function is not called. The first time command-period is pressed this is written to the console:\r\n\r\n2019-05-04 17:28:35.961626-0400 CommandPeriod[401:33541] [MC] System group container for systemgroup.com.apple.configurationprofiles path is /private/var/containers/Shared/SystemGroup/systemgroup.com.apple.configurationprofiles\r\n2019-05-04 17:28:35.963297-0400 CommandPeriod[401:33541] [MC] Reading from public effective user settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12.2 (16E227)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nI see this on my iPad Air 2 with a Magic Keyboard attached."
