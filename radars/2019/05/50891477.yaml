    description: "Area:\r\nExternal Accessory Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI want to be able to take a phone call but also use an AppLink navigation app while connected to SYNC. To use AppLink mobile navigation apps, the app needs to be in the foreground of the phone or else the user basically sees a black screen or a frozen screen on SYNC. (depends on the app)\r\nOn iOS devices , if the user launches an AppLink navigation app on SYNC, SYNC uses RequestAppLaunch (RAL) to launch the app on the phone so the user gets to use their app as expected. However, if the user accepts a phone call on SYNC and then goes back to their navigation app in SYNC â€“ the phone call screen on the phone blocks the RAL, so the user just sees a black screen. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone to SYNC unit\r\n2. Launch navigation app (Waze)\r\n3. Take Call on SYNC unit\r\n4. Observe that the SYNC screen goes to the SYNC phone screen and the iPhone goes to the Phone screen\r\n5. Tap on Waze in SYNC\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWaze is brought into the foreground on the device so the user can continue navigation while in a phone call.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWaze is not brought into the foreground on the device, so the image is frozen on sync.\r\nRecovery Steps:\r\nIf you go into the phone and minimize(green bar on top of view) the phone screen on the iPhone THEN tap Waze in SYNC, then Waze is brought into the foreground on the iPhone. This even works if you minimize(green bar on top of view) the phone screen on the iPhone then bring it back up then tap Waze on SYNC.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.2 Public Release"
