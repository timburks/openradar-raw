    description: "This bug was reported against our framework (https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/1250). Basically, it appears that merely initializing a new UIWindow, even if it's not on screen, causes status bar orientation changes even when the view controller in the visible window declares that it does not change orientation.\r\n\r\nThe issue linked above describes the issue in detail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance property to YES in Info.plist of the app\r\n```xml\t\r\n        <key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n```\r\n2. Make sure your app supports Landscape left, landscape right, portrait (can be done in Target or Info.plist)\r\n3. Now, you should be able to choose (through your code) which view controllers will support which orientations.\r\n4.  Thus if one view controller only wanted to support portrait, then override supportedInterfaceOrientations to return .portrait \r\n5.  Create a new window object with a root view controller that supports all interface orientations that the app supports.\r\n6.  Use app and rotate the device to landscape - you will see the status bar rotate even though the view controller supports portrait only\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView controllers that only support the portrait orientation should not see the status bar rotate when the device rotates\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nView controllers that only support the portrait orientation do see the status bar rotate when the device rotates"
