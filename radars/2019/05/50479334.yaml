    description: "As long as thereâ€™s an internet connection, every app can send requests and data to any server in the world.\r\nEven when the user trusts the developer behind an app, that app might use a sketchy framework that does more than what it promises on paper.\r\n\r\nApple could demand developers to disclose which domains their app need to access to, and make sure that any other request outside those is blocked.\r\n\r\nMore details here: https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-app-network-sandboxing"
