    description: "There’s an app called Fluid (https://fluidapp.com), which can take in a web address and spit out an app which is tied to that web address. So for instance I can have a GitHub app with a GitHub icon, that I use for GitHub things. It lets me whitelist domains (like my company’s auth provider) but non-GitHub links open in Safari.\r\n\r\nI think this feature would be great to have built-in to Safari or macOS directly. Recent changes to plugin architectures and WebKit rendering has made Fluid less effective over the years. While I love that app and the flexibility and power it gives me, I think it’s really a feature that should be integrated in Safari."
