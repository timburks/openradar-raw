    description: "When creating a new iOS/macOS application App Transport Security (ATS) is enabled by default. The default configuration enforces a minimum TLS version of TLS 1.2. If a developer wants to harden this configuration by enforcing TLS 1.3 connections, this is currently not possible.\r\n\r\nAssume that example.com supports TLS 1.3.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to enforce TLS 1.3 for example.com via ATS configuration or setting the minimum supported TLS protocol programmatically, all connections to example.com will fail.\r\n\r\nFor applications only TLS 1.2 connections will be established, unless the maximum supported TLS protocol is set to `.tlsProtocol13` or `.tlsProtocolMaxSupported`.\r\n\r\nCommand line applications on macOS behave differently. There is no ATS and TLS 1.3 connections will be established by default. TLS 1.3 can also not be enforced for them.\r\n\r\nSee details and proof-of-concept code at https://gist.github.com/blochberger/8e98f768502283dccb245f7ca81a79f8\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nFixed with macOS 11 (Big Sur). Validated on macOS 11.0.1 (20B50). Resolved date approximate."
