    description: "While Alternate Icons are awesome, the current way to implement such feature (drop image files in project root, declare each icon size in info.plist) Is error prone and requires too much manual work.\r\n\r\nHaving the possibility to add alternate icons directly on an assets catalog would make this implementation much easier."
