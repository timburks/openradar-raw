    description: "Currently apps that offer auto-renewable subscriptions are required to present within their own UI plenty of legalese details such as:\r\n- Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. \r\n- The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \r\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. \r\n- You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.\r\n\r\nAnd more.\r\n\r\nApple already presents a confirmation sheet where users have to authenticate and approve a transaction:\LInstead of requiring every single app to display all the details above themselves, such details could be moved to the confirmation sheet instead (maybe this confirmation sheet could be a two step process, or something similar)."
