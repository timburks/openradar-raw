    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an HTML email is read using dark mode, the colours are edited to be inverted. This can cause accessibility issues and dramatic inconsistencies between the Apple Mail app and other email clients or when the email is viewed in Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet preferences to dark mode.\r\n\r\nSend an HTML email with the code @Media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {body{background:#c00000;color:#ffffff}}.\r\n\r\nOpen the email in Apple Mail app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect the background of the body to be dark red and the text white, as it is when opened in Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe media query is recognised and read but all colours in the HTML are \"auto corrected\".  So the black background now becomes pale red and the text black.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nOS 10.14.4 (18E226)\r\nMail Version 12.4 (3445.104.8)"
