    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen MKMapView needs to scroll in order to display a callout for an MKAnnotationView at the edge of the screen, it sometimes fails to dismiss a previously displayed callout (even though the annotation view is no longer selected).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Build and run this sample app:\r\nhttps://github.com/danielbarela/ios-map-callout-test\r\n- zoom in so that some of the pins are no longer visible\r\n- quickly drag from the center to the edge of the screen forcing map view to scroll in order to display the callouts.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- only the callout of the selected annotation should be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- callouts of non-selected annotations are still stuck on screen.\r\n\r\n(See screen movie)"
