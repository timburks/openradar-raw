    description: "Currently there is an autocomplete for ending sentences whereby typing two spaces \"  \" is substituted with \". \"\r\n\r\nThis is incredibly useful when typing \"Hi, my name is radar. What's yours?\" (in this case I typed two spaces after radar and let autocomplete do the rest) but is VERY frustrating in the common scenario that someone is trying to space out something non-text like emojis \"\U0001F41C.            \U0001F987\"\r\n\r\nSuggestion: the double-space to period-space substitution should be disabled when the leading character is a non-text character like an emoji :) If you do you'll make million of emoji typers everywhere let out a sigh of relief that they don't have to select, and delete that little extra dot."

    title: Typing two spaces after an emoji should not autofill a period
