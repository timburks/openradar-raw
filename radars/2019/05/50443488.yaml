    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboards, mice and trackpads\r\n\r\nI've used Karabiner Elements (https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) for years now, but every time there's a macOS update (10.14.4 in this case), it seems to break Karabiner Elements.  I'm tired of not having an Apple-supported, native macOS means of remapping keystrokes, especially after having spent around $4000 on a MacBook Pro in 2012, and then again 2019.\r\n\r\nFor accessibility reasons, I use a Microsoft Surface ergonomic keyboard (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MFCTRZM).  I simply would like to remap the left Alt key to Apple's left Command key, the left Windows key to Apple's Option key, and same for the right Alt & Windows keys.  A more general solution, however, would be to allow arbitrary key remappings.\r\n\r\nIn the Keyboard system preferences pane, if you select the Keyboard tab, then click the \"Modifier Keys...\" button, a dialog pops up that lets you remap only 4 keys:  Caps Lock, Control, Option & Command.  The problem is, if I remap Option to Command and Command to Option, I do not get the desired behavior on the Microsoft Surface keyboard, only on my MacBook Pro's keyboard.\r\n\r\nPlease expand that dialog to allow the remapping of any keystroke to any other keystroke, and make the remappings specific to each keyboard device, so that I can have multiple keyboards each with their own key remappings.\r\n\r\nPlease listen to a paying customer who has taken the time to issue a reasonable and thorough issue, and provide an Apple-supported equivalent of Karabiner Elements.\r\n\r\nApple BugReport issue number is 50443488.\r\n\r\nAttachments sent are at https://imgur.com/JGNfBZD & https://imgur.com/oVAOYfh"
