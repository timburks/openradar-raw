    description: "Questions like “What is the battery on my phone?“ should always have a clear answer.\r\nWhen I ask for an action that has to run on a device, I would like Siri (from the HomePod or elsewhere) to forward it to the correct device, not telling me that I can’t do that on the device it responds from.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2019-05-16:\r\nMarked as duplicate of 40539074 (not available on Open Radar)"
