    description: "Summary: I have an m4a file which I added to my library some time ago, and it played fine. Now, after the most recent update to versi√≥n 12.9.4.94 iTunes is unable to play it back, and the file says to have a length of 789:57:13,152, which is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe file still plays fine with quicklook from the Finder and shows the correct 2:53 time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Take the attached file and drag it into iTunes.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: See the file with length of 2:53 and be able to play it back.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: See the file with length of 789:57:13,152 and iTunes refuses to play it back.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iTunes 12.9.4.94, OSX 10.14.4 (18E226)\r\n\r\nAttachment: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttydcb6oauyp4i3/open_radar_50702300.m4a?dl=0"
