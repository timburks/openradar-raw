    description: "Summary:\r\nDeleting a relatively big video file in the storage view controller in settings app blocks main thread of application leading to blocked UI until deleting the video has been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload some video that has a decent amount of bytes (~400mb of a Netflix TV show in my example), go to Settings, general cell, iPad storage cell, review downloaded videos cell, swipe to left on item to delete, now the main thread should be blocked until operation has been completed. All interactions will settings app will freeze until then. Thereâ€™s also a video attached to this issue showing the bad performance of delete operation.\r\n\r\nAlso going to home screen and immediately opening the settings app again, will query for sizes (on main thread again).\r\n \r\nExpected Results:\r\nDeleting a video should be performed on background thread to keep UI usable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDeleting a video blocks main thread blocking the UI.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.2 (16E227)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2018, 32 GB"
