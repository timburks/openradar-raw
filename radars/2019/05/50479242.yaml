    description: "Apple guideline 4.5.3 states “Do not use Apple Services to spam, phish, or send unsolicited messages to customers, including Game Center, Push Notifications, etc.”\r\n\r\nPlenty of apps disregard this guideline and misuse push notifications to present advertisements to their customers, some apps even force their users to enable notifications in order to use their app at all.\r\n\r\nWhile it’s impossible for Apple to enforce this rule in every single app out in the store,\r\nIt would be great if there was a way for users to report junk like when receiving an iMessage from a unknown contact.\r\n\r\nOnce Apple receives multiple reports of the same app, then, and only then, an internal investigation can be opened and it is decided whether to take further action for that or not."
