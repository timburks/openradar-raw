    description: "There are no reliable, supported ways to set a simulator’s location programmatically, for example for use in UI Automation tests running with XCTest. It would be very useful to be able to run\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ xcrun simctl location booted simulate-location --latitude “37.3308337” --longitude “-122.0096567”\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful to get the simulator’s location for similar reasons.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ xcrun simctl location booted get-location\r\nLatitude: 37.3308337\r\nLongitude: -122.0096567\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, being able to play a GPX file would be lovely, similar to the feature available in “Xcode in Debug -> Simulate Location -> Add GPX File to Workspace…”\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ xcrun simctl location booted simulate-location --gpx-file my_run.gpx\r\n```"
