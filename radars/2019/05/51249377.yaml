    description: "Summary:\r\nIdentityLookup API is failing on iOS 12.3.1. Even after passing `.filter` action it still allows the SMS. (It was working correctly on iOS 12.3)\r\n\r\nThis only happens the first time an SMS from a particular sender is received. Any subsequent .filter action work as intended. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached TestSMSFilter.zip.\r\n2. Build and Install the app to device and enable filter extension from Settings.app.\r\n3. Send any SMS from an unknown number.\r\n4. The first time an SMS is received from a particular sender, it will fail to get filtered. Any subsequent SMS from same sender will get filtered correctly.\r\n\r\nYou can repeat this test by deleting that particular sender's SMS thread and sending SMS again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe SMS should be filtered and moved to the SMS Junk section of Messages.app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe SMS is allowed.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.3.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X 64Gb.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes: \r\nThis is the same issue as reported previously in radar #42417770. It was previously fixed but has regressed somehow in iOS 12.3.1."
