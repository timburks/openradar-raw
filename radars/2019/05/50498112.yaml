    description: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI did not found any mechanism or good pattern to correctly manage the \"invitation use case\" : \r\n\r\n- From a given application I send a link to a friend to invite him to launch the same application on its device for a specific purpose. \r\n- If this friend already installed this application on its device, no problem, a deep link launches the application with the appropriate context.\r\n- If this friend has not already installed this application on its device, he is redirected on the App Store to let him install the application if he wishes it. If he installs the application and launches it, then the initial context is lost. \r\n\r\nThere is a lack of mechanism or pattern to natively manage this use case.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\nSebastien.\r\n\r\nComments"
