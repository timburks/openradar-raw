    description: "When it's time to upgrade my phone or watch or Mac, it means any subscription I've set up using an Apple Pay virtual card on that device, will be declined going forward. It's like losing my wallet every time I upgrade a device, which for my phone is once a year, and for my watch every 1-2 years, and for my Macs, every few years. \r\n\r\nThat's a lot of lost wallets!\r\n\r\nIn addition, having to setup every Apple Pay card on the new device is a real pain in the butt. \r\n\r\nCan Apple devise a way to securely migrate Apple Pay cards from one hardware device to the next, without destroying the virtual cards in the process? Then we wouldn't need to re-setup the cards each time, and the subscriptions wouldn't be declined."
