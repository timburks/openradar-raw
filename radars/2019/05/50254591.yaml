    description: "This is a duplicate of radar #36027761\r\n\r\nThe radar describes the issue for iOS 11 but the bug still occurs as of iOS 12.3 beta (16F5139e). This is a severe bug because tappable callouts \"erratically\" fail as soon as they're displayed on top of other annotations. \r\n\r\nAlso, the bug is *even more severe* as described originally:\r\n- The bug also occurs for the whole callout content that normally fires the right callout accessory button.\r\n- The bug also occurs for the leftCalloutAccessoryView (to reproduce just replace `pinView.rightCalloutAccessoryView` by `pinView.leftCalloutAccessoryView` in ViewController.m:55 of the sample app)\r\n\r\nPlease fix this bug with high priority. All apps using multiple pin annotations with tappable callouts are affected!\r\n\r\n\r\n## original radar ##\r\n\r\nWhen adding a rightCalloutAccessoryView with a UIButton, the button does not respond to taps when another MKAnnotationView is on the map behind the button.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project on the iOS 11.2 simulator.\r\nTap on one of the pins in the lower right corner of pins to show the callout bubble where the info button is located in front of any of the other pins.\r\nAttempt to tap on the info button it and see that nothing happens.\r\nTap on one of of the pins on the right side of the block of pins to show the callout bubble where the info button is located with no pins behind it (only the map should be behind it).\r\nTap the info button and see the alert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the button would work even if there are pins behind the button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button only works when there are no pins behind the button.  This works fine in iOS 10.3\r\n\r\nSample App Github Repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/danielbarela/ios-map-callout-test\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.3 beta (16F5139e)"
