    description: "Area:\r\nCallKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nApps using CallKit can cause audible ringing, even when the user disallows that app having notification sounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install WhatsApp and set it up.\r\n2. In Settings > Notifications > WhatsApp set Sounds to off.\r\n3. Call that WhatsApp account from another device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo ringing. Only a notification about the call should be shown with no sound. Or have a separate setting for calls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe device produces an audible ringtone (in the middle of a meeting you’re chairing).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone SE\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI also have Settings > Sounds > Ringtone set to a silent audio file. It’s not okay for people to be able to make my devices make a sound. I don’t want to turn on silent mode permanently because I like UI sounds if they’re in response my my input (such as keyboard clicks)."
