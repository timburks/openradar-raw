    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nHTML5 video control wil supported video type will not play when the user clicks the play button in iOS 12.2. \r\n\r\nIn the safari console, we see this error:\r\n>Unhandled Promise Rejection: NotAllowedError: The request is not allowed by >the user agent or the platform in the current context, possibly because the >user denied permission\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn an html page we have got a video control:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<video height=\"240\" width=\"360\" controls>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<source src=\"myvideo.m4v\"> video not supported\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</video>\r\n\r\nThe video is a supported video type. The user clicks the play button and it does not play. In the safari console, we see the error above.\r\n\r\nThere is no javascript code controlled by us that is playing the video. It appears in the safari debugger that webkit is injecting some javascript that is calling `HTMLMedia​Element​.play()`, but it is not my code.\r\n\r\nThis happens whether UIWebView or WKWebView is being used.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe video will play\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video does not play, and the error message above appears.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNo special configuration.\r\n\r\nIf `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction` is set to YES on the webview, the video will play. I believe this is should not be required, because the video play button is hit by a user interaction."
