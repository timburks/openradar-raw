    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the attached zip, I have a project that includes a framework. In the framework's class hierarchy, a subclass makes an internal 'initialize' method open. In the app, I subclass that class with an open 'initialize' method and try to build.\r\n\r\nIn Debug, it builds fine. In Release, the linker fails to find the method descriptor for that method and the build fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Project\r\n2. Select the Release scheme\r\n3. Build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt builds without issue. Or at least, it builds with the exact same result in the Debug scheme.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt fails to build with a linker error.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 10.2.1 (10E1001)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.14.4 (18E226)"
