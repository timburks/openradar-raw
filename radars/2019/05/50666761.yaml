    description: "Our app supports Russian, Ukrainian and Turkish localizations. When only English is selected in iOS Settings, Locale.current returns uk_US, but Localization native development region is set to \"ru\". NSLocalizedString however provides strings in correct locale (russian).\r\nDateFormatters also provide strings in ukrainian (supposably as they are using Locale.current under the hood).\r\n\r\nAs result, app is presented to user in two languages at the same time: Ukrainian and Russian.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new project.\r\n2. Remove English localization\r\n3. Add Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish localizations\r\n4. Open project file in text editor\r\n5. Replace \"developmentRegion = en\" to \"developmentRegion = ru\". Optionally set CFBundleDevelopmentRegion to \"ru\" in Info.plist.\r\n6. Erase content and settings or select only English language in iOS Settings.\r\n7. Check output of NSLocalizedString and Locale.current.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nExecute step 6 and open attached sample app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLocale.current returns ru_US.\r\nDateFormatters and NSLocalizedString return strings in Russian.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLocale.current returns uk_US.\r\nDateFormatters return strings in Ukrainian.\r\nNSLocalizedString returns strings from ru.lproj.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iOS 12, simulators and devices.\r\n\r\nIf there is any workaround, please tell us how it can be applied."
