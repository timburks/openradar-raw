    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf \"Require password\" is enabled in SysPrefs > Security > General, then upon waking the Mac from sleep/screensaver and unlocking via keyboard, the frontmost app is \"NULL\" and thus any keyboard input just results in a \"sysbeep\" until another app is clicked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I have a Python script that simply prints the PID, Name and Path of the focused app. Download that script here & run it from a Terminal:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/luckman212/91cdd9a08e98a9f01214bdfde3057e85 \r\n2. Enable the \"Require password\" option in SysPrefs>Security. Set to \"5 seconds\" for testing (see screenshot)\r\n3. Launch TextEdit and create a new document.\r\n4. With TextEdit having focus, invoke the screensaver (using a Hot Corner is easiest)\r\n5. Wait for the security timer to elapse (>5 seconds)\r\n6. Tap a key to unlock the screen\r\n7. Enter your password\r\n8. The .py script should now show \"no active app\" (similar to attached screenshot) even though in the Menu bar it appears as though TextEdit still has focus.\r\n9. Try typing - you should hear your sysbeep sound, and nothing is output in TextEdit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTextEdit should regain focus after ScreenSaver exits.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"NIL\" or \"NULL\" focusedapp.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\ntested & reproduced on:\r\n10.14.4 final\r\n10.14.5 final (18F132)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmac Mini 2018, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD\r\n\r\nsome more background + details at:\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/768"
