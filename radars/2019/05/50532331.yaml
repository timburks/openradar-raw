    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAn encrypted ZIP 2.0 file containing at least one 0 byte file will fail to extract using the bundled Archive Utility.app. It seems like the bundled extractor gets a 0 byte output and thinks the password is incorrect, so it asks the password again in a loop.\r\n\r\nUsed Keka to create the test encrypted file, although tested too with WinZIP and BetterZIP. Those, Info-ZIP (unzip in the Terminal) and The Unarchiver extract the file properly.\r\n\r\nYou can recreate the test file, simply add a 0 byte file (touch void.txt) and encrypt it with Keka, WinZIP, BetterZIP or similar. Compressing it with Info-ZIP (test_infozip.zip) will not trigger the issue since it uses the obsolete ZIP 1.0 and this seems to fail only with 2.0 version.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached file \"test.zip\" with Archive Utility.app\r\n2. Archive Utility.app will ask for the file's password\r\n3. Type in the password (test) and hit ok\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file should extract properly, given the correct password\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nArchive Utility.app will ask the password again for the zero byte file \"void.txt\". It will not accept the correct password (test) or any other.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTested from Mac OS X 10.9 Archive Utility 10.9.1 (71.3) to macOS 10.14 Archive Utility 10.11 (101)."
