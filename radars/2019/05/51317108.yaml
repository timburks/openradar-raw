    description: "Summary:\r\nTwo common Windows TB3 docks are:\r\n- HP Thunderbolt G2 dock\r\n- Lenovo Thinkpad TB3 Dock\r\n\r\nIn our investigations and testing, the majority of the functionality of these docks work great in MacOS, EXCEPT connecting multiple displays through them.\r\nIn the HP Thunderbolt G2 dock, there are 2 DisplayPort ports. If we try to connect two DisplayPort displays, only 1 works.\r\nWe have confirmed that if you install Windows 10 in Bootcamp on the Mac, you can connect two DisplayPort displays, and both work in extended mode or mirrored mode.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a limitation of MacOS, not the hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect HP Thunderbolt G2 dock, and two monitors via DisplayPort\r\nTry to extend desktop across both displays.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDesktop extends across Mac display, and two external DisplayPort displays.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDesktop extends across Mac display, and one external DisplayPort display.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nConfirmed this occurs in all versions of MacOS including 10.14.5 (latest at time of submission)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)"
