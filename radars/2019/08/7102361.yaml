    description: "Problem: [Mac 10.15] Integrity of ExManCmd [Unix Executable] cannot be verified even after notarizing the dmg\r\n\r\nMethod To Reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1. Download the notarized dmg from the website.\r\n\r\n2. Extract the contents of the dmg in a folder\r\n  \r\n3. Launch Terminal and run ExmanCmd [Unix Executable]\r\n\r\nYou get a popup saying \"ExmanCmd cant be opened because its integrity cannot be verified\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResult: ExMan Command Line tool is not working\r\n\r\nExpected:  ExMan Command Line tool should function properly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever , if we double click the unix executable ExmanCmd and it shows:\r\n\"This application is downloaded from internet. Do you want to open it\".\r\nWhen click on open and then launch ExmanCmd in terminal , it works fine.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis issue is seen on 10.15 machines where SIP (System Integrity Protection) is enabled by default. It is not seen on machines where is SIP is disabled (csrutil disable)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is this anomaly being observed and  what is its solution ?"
