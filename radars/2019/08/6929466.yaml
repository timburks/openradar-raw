    description: "When archiving a static library written in Swift, the .swiftmodule is missing.\r\nAdditionally, even if placed into the archive by a script after the fact, the `xcodebuild -create-xcframework` command also ignores the .swiftmodule and doesn't copy it over.\r\n\r\nRepro: https://github.com/igor-makarov/DemoStaticLib\r\n\r\nRun the `./test.sh`\r\nObserve the difference betweem the plain build (has Swift module) and the archive (has not)."
