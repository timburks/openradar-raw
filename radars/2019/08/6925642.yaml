    description: "My iPhone is set to forward SMS messages to my iMac and MacBook Pro. The problem is that the longer the iMac has been running, the further the received timestamps drift.  The timestamps do not drift on the iPhone.  The timestamp as seen on the iMac will not match the MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nBy drift I mean that the logged timestamp will be in the past, so upon receipt the message will already say \"message received 7 minutes ago\". The message receipt is not actually *delayed*; it arrives on the iMac at the same time as the iPhone. iMessages are not affected.  If the iMac is rebooted then the timestamps will be in sync again, but then start to drift.  The iMac clock is properly synchronized with the Apple time service.\r\n\r\nFor example, I rebooted the iMac on July 27th. Here's the timestamps of forwarded SMS messages:\r\n\r\nActual Time    iMac Messages\r\n8/3  4:52 pm      4:44\r\n8/3  3:38 pm      3:30\r\n7/30 8:59 pm      8:53\r\n7/29 7:09 pm      7:04\r\n7/27 5:57 pm      5:55\r\n\r\nThis is a repeatable problem."
