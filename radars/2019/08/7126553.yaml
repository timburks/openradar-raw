    description: "N.B. this is FB7126553.\r\n\r\nApple has made major improvements to prevent cross-site tracking in Safari with ITP. I would suggest that Apple takes the same approach to iOS apps and provides unique advertising ids to each app or app group to prevent cross-app tracking within iOS. \r\n\r\nI think many users would be surprised to realise that the App Store rules currently allows different apps to link to the same user. I know there are policies to only use this for advertising, but this is \r\na) difficult to enforce once the ID has left the device, and \r\nb) tracking is part of the economic model of ads at the moment.\r\n\r\nMaking advertising identifiers unique would create a similar advertising environment between iOS and the web, helping to move the entire advertising ecosystem away from cross-site tracking."
