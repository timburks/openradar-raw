    description: "First off, please believe that we all agree with Apple’s decision to grant users greater control over their personal data. It is a very important topic for happn and we are committed to focusing on this matter since dating-related personal data is a very sensitive subject for users.\r\nHowever, the user flow for granting location permissions in iOS 13 is problematic for apps that require the use of background location to provide core functionality.\r\n\r\nThe main reason users download happn is because it allows them to find the people they crossed paths with during their day, whether they’re currently using the app or just living their life with their iPhone in their pocket. For this core feature to be available to the users, happn needs to be aware of the users’ significant location changes. This allows users to see each other in the app by matching their locations. When users download happn, they expect to be able to see every other user they crossed paths with since they last opened it, without having to relaunch the app every time their location changes.\r\nWith the iOS 13 new permission access flow regarding user geolocation, happn will not function as planned for users that just installed the app: their first experience just won’t be the one we want them to have. If the app needs to access geolocation in the background, the OS will later ask the user at a random moment if they want to grant more permissions to the app, offering them to choose between “While Using the App” and “Always”, even this dual choice is probably not the right one as most of our users probably don’t realize immediately that the app will only fully reach its promise only when the “always” choice is made. Only after this stage, the app will function normally, as expected by the user. But until that second stage, the app will not provide the user with what they expect from it, i.e. seeing the people they have crossed paths with and they will think happn is not working or worst, not delivering its promise.\r\n\r\nMoreover, during this trial period where the app will not be able to access the user’s geolocation in the background, the app won’t be able to “know” the level of permission the user has granted it. The API should inform the app about what level of permission the user has given it. Yet, it will say “Always allow” during this period, whatever the permission granted may be. So, even if the app wanted to adapt its experience via the “While in use” permission, with specific screens, onboarding flows or notifications for instance, it could not do it since it would not have access to this info. Thus we are expecting in iOS 13 to have access to the real value of permission to guide the user properly. \r\n\r\nWe would like iOS to allow developers to ask the user for background geolocation data access permission from the first time they use the app, right after they have downloaded it. It could be similar to the flow in iOS 12; it could also take the form of a new flow conveying the importance of this type of data to the user for them to be aware of the type of permission they grant. The most important thing is to avoid the flow that has been planned out for the new OS, in which the “Always” option is not available when using the app for the first time, causing the app not to deliver on its promise and provide the user with the service that is advertised, for an approximate period of time. Therefore, in the current state of affairs, when iOS 13 comes out, we will set up a redirection system leading to the app settings upon the first opening of the app, for the user to grant us the right permission, as your designers advice us at the WWDC.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we would say that as we explained above, users’ control over their personal data is taken very seriously at happn and we could not agree more with Apple about the “privacy first” policy. Which is why we condone the idea of implementing a warning reminding the user that a given application has access to their geolocation data in the background. But users are downloading our app in order to find people they crossed paths with, and with the release of iOS 13 as it is planned so far, our app is going to lose its most important and requested functionality at the first launch, and furthermore for a undetermined time."
