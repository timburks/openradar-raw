    description: "Problem: in an app, instances of UIManagedDocument that are created for display in a UIDocumentBrowserViewController appear as folders rather than as documents.  This problem occurs even though the app's Document Types and Exported UTIs are set up exactly as they appear in Apple's Particles app sample application demonstrating the UIDocumentBrowserViewController.\r\n\r\nWhat happens: the UIManagedDocument appears as a folder in the UIDocumentBrowserViewController, rather than as the document it is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nHow I solved the problem: I included \"com.apple.package\" in the \"Conforms to\" field of the Exported UTIs in the target's info.  This needed addition to the field is not, however, documented by Apple in its documentation for UIDocument/UIManagedDocument and UIDocumentBrowserViewController.  Minimally, the \"conforms to\" field addition of com.apple.package should be noted in that particular documentation."
