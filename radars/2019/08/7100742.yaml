    description: "On iOS 13, QLPreviewController prevents any specified UIKeyCommands from working when editing mode is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe key commands are registered correctly (as the shortcuts show up in the discoverability HUD) but hitting the actual keys on HW keyboard does nothing.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached demo app in a Simulator or on a device (e.g. iPad Pro 11\" with attached HW keyboard)\r\n2. Show a preview for multiple images by tapping the \"Present QLPreviewController\" button\r\n3. Press and hold CMD key to show discoverability HUD\r\n4. Tap right arrow key and left arrow key to navigation between images\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nA handler specified for the UIKeyCommand is triggered and QLPreviewController navigates to another image.\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\nThe handler specified for the UIKeyCommand is not triggered and QLPreviewController does not navigate to another image."
