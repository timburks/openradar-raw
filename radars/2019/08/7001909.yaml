    description: "Radar #: FB7001909\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nThere is no information about the test failure in the xcresult `action_TestSummaries.plist` when +setUp/+tearDown methods of an `XCTestCase` throw exceptions. Despite the non-zero exit code returned from xcodebuild, not having explicit entries for what is broken makes it hard to know where to look. \r\n\r\nThis is particularly insidious, because Xcode reports this run as successful. Also, it means that if cleanup fails silently, it might cause failures in subsequent tests without any notification about that failure. As an aside, this also happens to also break our test failure metrics, which leaves us blind to the frequency of these failure modes.\r\n\r\nMy request would be to insert a failed test result for the class +setUp and +tearDown methods in the case that they fail.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Open attached sample project\r\n2. Press CMD+U to run tests\r\n3. Check the Report Navigator for test results\r\nOBSERVE: No failures are reported in the Report Navigator, or in the xcresult bundle file `action_TestSummaries.plist`\r\n4. Comment out +setUp method in `asfasfTests.m` & rerun tests\r\nOBSERVE CORRECT: Failure is reported for `asfasfTests.testExample` in Report navigator and xcresult bundle from failure in `-setUp`\r\n5. Comment out -setUp method in `asfasfTests.m` & rerun tests\r\nOBSERVE CORRECT: Failure is reported for `asfasfTests.testExample` in Report navigator and xcresult bundle from failure in `-tearDown`\r\n6. Comment out -tearDown method in `asfasfTests.m` & rerun tests\r\nOBSERVE: No failure is reported for `asfasfTests.testExample` in Report navigator and xcresult bundle from failure in `+tearDown`, test reported as successful.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nWhen +setUp/+tearDown are the exceptions which cause a test to fail, there should be a record of it in the xcresult log.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n`+setUp` exception: No record of test class run being attempted, no record of failure.\r\n`+tearDown` exception: All tests reported as successful, no record of failure."
