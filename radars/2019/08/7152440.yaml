    description: "Basic information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nMasterDetail ObjC template has an issue caused new behaviour of the iOS 13 panel implementation of UISplitViewController\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nXcode\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDetails\r\nWhat version of Xcode are you using?\r\n11b7\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nWhen using the MasterDetail template and launching it in portrait on the Xcode 11 beta 7 iOS 13 Simulator (e.g. iPhone 8 Plus) the MasterViewController detailViewController property is not set to a a DetailViewController, see screenshot in the red box you can see the type is MasterViewController (the search of the split view controller found the wrong controller).\r\n\r\nThe problem is caused by the new behaviour of the iOS 13 panel UISplitViewController. When launching in portrait it now collapses before viewDidLoad is called, the old iOS 12 behaviour with the class implementation of UISplitViewController the view was loaded first which is why this previously was ok. This means by the time viewDidLoad is called there is no longer a detail view controller to find it has already been discarded during the collapse.\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached, please also see the readme in the project that gives more information including two possible changes that could be made to the template. To move this code to awakeFromNib or set the property in the app delegate.\r\n\r\nFYI the behaviour in the Swift template is there is a type check that causes the property not to be set to anything which needs a similar fix.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nOpen attached sample project SplitBadDetail.\r\nLaunch in iPhone 8 Plus Simulator. \r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nself.detailViewController should be of class DetailViewController\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nself.detailViewController mistakenly is set to MasterViewController"
