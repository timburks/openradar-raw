    description: "On an iPad Pro (9.7-inch) running iOS 12.4, calls to the UIDocumentBrowserViewController's revealDocumentAtURL:importIfNeeded:completion: method fail to import the url even when the importIfNeeded parameter is set to YES.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n(1) Tap on a file attachment in the Mail app, and select \"copy to <appName>\" in the resulting share menu.\r\n(2) The revealDocumentAtURL:importIfNeeded:completion: method is called in <appName>, but even when the importIfNeeded parameter is set to YES, the url is not imported.  Apple's documentation indicates that \"If importIfNeeded is YES, the document browser calls its delegate's documentBrowser:didImportDocumentAtURL:toDestinationURL: method (or its documentBrowser:failedToImportDocumentAtURL:error: method, if an error occurred) before calling the completion handler.\"  Contrary to the documentation, neither of those importing methods is ever called, and the url that is opened by the app-being-imported-into (in the revealDocumentAtURL's completion handler) is the url associated with the file attachment in the Mail app, rather than any url imported into the app's container."
