    description: "The current user flow for granting location permissions in iOS 13 is problematic for apps that require the use of background location to provide core functionality. This includes the Inner Circle Copilot app as well as many apps that use the Zendrive SDK (including GasBuddy, SherpaShare, and Hurdlr). \r\n\r\nThe main reason users download these apps is so they can see statistics about their driving including accurate trip trails and safety information (e.g. were they hard braking or using their phone more than an average driver), or simply to record accurate driving mileage. These apps are intended to run in the background and track driving for these users without requiring the user to interact with the app every time they start driving. This background activity is the stated purpose of the app and the user expectation when the app is downloaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, because of the way users grant apps location permissions under iOS 13, these apps will not function as expected when they are first downloaded. iOS 13 only allows users to grant “While Using the App” location permission when the app first launches. If the app is set up to use background location, then the OS will, at some unspecified point later in time, ask the user if they want to upgrade from “While Using the App” to “Always” location permission. After that point, the app will function normally. But up until that second permission request, the app is unable to perform the function that the users want. If the user opens the app during this period, the app will appear broken.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, during this interim period where the app is prevented from accessing location in the background, the app can't even check what level of location permission it has. The API that would normally tell the app what level of location permission has been granted, but rather it returns “Always Allow” during this period regardless of what permission has been granted. Thus, even if the app wanted to adjust its behavior to account for the lower level of location access until it had full background access, it could not effectively do so because it does not have access to the necessary information to make these adjustments.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround available here where during new user onboarding, the app provides a link to iPhone settings for the app so the user can manually enable background location permissions there. However, this is a poor user experience requiring the user to leave the app, remember what they are supposed to do in the iPhone settings page, make the change, and then manually return to the app to finish onboarding. This is cumbersome and will inevitably result in user dropoff, confusion, and mistaken expectations.\r\n\r\nWe request that iOS provide developers the ability to offer a user flow where a user can grant access to background location permission upon the first download of an app. This could be similar to the permission flow in iOS 12, or it could be a new flow with increased emphasis on user privacy and making sure the user understands the permissions they are granting. The important thing is to avoid the current proposed situation where background location apps fail to meet user expectations for an unspecified period following the first download of the app."
