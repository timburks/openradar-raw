    description: "Summary:\r\n- Using UISearchBar as a titleView in a UIViewController's navigationItem. \r\n- Then pushing an another UIViewController to the navigation stack. \r\n- Finally when we pop back by swiping to the previous viewController, the searchBar is no longer visible.\r\nThis problem only persists on iPad.\r\n+1: If we cancel the swipe back midway, the back button also becomes invisible on the top viewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nRun the sample project, tap \"push\" button. Swipe from the left edge of the of the screen to the right edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe starting screen would appear, with a search bar on the top.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe starting screen appears without the SearchBar.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS SDK: 12.4\r\nSimulator Version: 12.4 (iPad Air 3rd generation)\r\n\r\nCode:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1abpvqBueH5LLdcllXC6SuLxgmgVsBmOs/view?usp=sharing"
