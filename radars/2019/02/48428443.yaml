    description: "Area:\r\nCore Graphics\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUIBezierPath linejoinstyle set to .round, which works fine except when 1 line segment comes back exactly over the previous line segment or the angle between the segments is very small, forming a sharp corner. This issue seems to have been reported before, but for the iPad SDK, and was supposedly fixed in iOS 7 according to the Stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13425765/unexpected-linejoinstyle-behavior-when-lines-in-path-at-180-degrees \r\n\r\nTitle of that issue is 'Unexpected LineJoinStyle behavior when lines in path at 180 degrees'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDraw a bezier path from point1 to point2, then draw a second path from point2 back to point1 or any point very close to point1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe joint of the line segments should be round\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJoint is clipped off and looks square\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS version 12.1, Xcode 10.1"
