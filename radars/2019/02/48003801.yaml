    description: "Presenting UIActivityViewController with activity item of the type PHLivePhoto and then selecting the 'Save Live Photo' choice to save the Live Photo to the photo library always fails with this line logged twice to the console (once for each resource in the Live Photo?):\r\n\r\n2019-02-12 09:30:47.152096-0800 Activator[31153:14857751] Error: resource not available\r\n2019-02-12 09:30:47.154249-0800 Activator[31153:14857870] Error: resource not available\r\n\r\nThe Live Photo is created via the PHLivePhoto class method requestLivePhotoWithResourceFileURLs:placeholderImage:targetSize:contentMode:resultHandler:.\r\n\r\nThe resource file URLs reference a photo and a movie file that are located in the file hierarchy for my app, placeHolderImage is nil, targetSize is CGSizeZero, and contentMode is PHImageContentModeAspectFit.\r\n\r\nThe coded handles the multiple calls to the resultHandler by checking for the value at PHLivePhotoInfoIsDegradedKey and only presents the UIActivityViewController when the degraded is false or not present. The only activity item passed to the init method is the instance of the PHLivePhoto created above.\r\n\r\nI have attached a code snippet file that shows all of the above in detail.\r\n\r\nThis occurs when running on a variety of devices (iPhone XS, etc) running iOS 12.1.2."
