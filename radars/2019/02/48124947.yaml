    description: "Summary:\r\nTurns out there's some sort of retain cycle when trying to present a UIAlertController on a UIViewController that is being dismissed.\n\nThis is a violation of the presenting on a dismissed controller API, but it still smells like a bug to me that the view controller would be kept around in memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sample app\n2. Click on Present Modally?\n3. Click on Dismiss\n4. Try to click on Present Modally? again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt does not present and instead the text that was previously \"Unknown\" changes to \"The view controller should not exist!!\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt *should* present normally and the view controller should have been deallocated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdiAyyakad/ComeOnUIAlertController"
