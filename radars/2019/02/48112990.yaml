    description: "Summary:\r\nThe only two options to enable 2FA on an iCloud account today are:\n- Via an iOS device with iOS 9+\n- Via a Mac\n\n(Per https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915)\n\nBut if the iOS device already has an iCloud account set up, the others iCloud account are not manageable in the same way, and the user has no way to enable 2FA on these accounts.\n\nThe only remaining option is to... create a new \"dummy\" user on a Mac.\n(Per https://kylesethgray.com/adding-a-separate-developer-account-to-your-ios-device/ and https://www.jonathant.com/2019/02/13/how-to-activate-apple-id-2fa-when-you-have-two-accounts/).\n\nA nice solution to this problem would be to allow one to setup 2FA from a web browser on appleid.apple.com.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a first iCloud account to an iOS device (main account)\n2. Add a second iCloud account to an iOS device (secondary account)\n3. Attempt to setup 2FA for both accounts\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is possible to enable 2FA for the secondary account (either on the iOS device, or on appleid.apple.com)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not possible to setup 2FA for the secondary account, and appleid.apple.com provides no such option.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.4.1 (16D57)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
