    description: "Summary:\r\nIcons for apps moved to the \"dock\" of the iPad home screen are rendered with a size of 73x73pt instead of the expected 76pt.\nAs the icon PNG file we are asked to provide is for the 76pt size, icons in the dock are scaled down and the artwork may appear fuzzy (fine lines for example are crisp on the home screen and fuzzy in the dock).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install 2 apps with the same icon artwork\n2. Move one of the apps to the dock\n3. Compare the two icons (I expect the difference to be more visible on a retina screen)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icons look the same\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe icon in the dock appear fuzzy\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1.1 (16C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a screenshot of our icon app on an iPad mini screen. If opened in a image processing software we can easily see the difference between the two icons."
