    description: "Summary:\r\nThe 2-factor authentication system employed by Apple requires the user to be logged in to an Apple device, where the code is then displayed. A change coming to the Certificates & Profiles section of my Developer page is going to require 2FA be activated for my account.\n\nHowever the account I use to manage my certificates and profiles is not logged in on any Apple device. It’s associated with my company ID, and I use a personal Apple ID on my computers and iOS devices.\n\nI’d like there to be some way to enable 2FA on my account (of course I want the increased security) without the hassle of logging in on a device. This is traditionally accomplished by one-time password URLs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAfter Feb. 27, 2019, attempt to log in to the developer portal using an account not protected by 2FA and go to Certificates & Profiles.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to access the page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to access.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’m not proposing that 2FA not be enforced, rather that we need an alternate implementation that does not require an account logged in to an Apple device."
