    description: "Summary: In versions of OS X prior to Sierra, if you dragged a valid URL of a scheme other than http, ftp, vnc, to a Finder window or desktop, the Finder would create an .inetloc URL file.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen with Sierra, at least in the case of message URIs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a message URI. In this case it doesn't matter if it points to an actual message, since it won't create the .inetloc.\r\n\r\nFor example: message://<testmessageid@apple.com>\r\n\r\nDrag it to a Finder window.  But drag it from where? The way I used to do it was either:\r\na) paste the message URI into the Safari location bar, then drag it from there\r\nb) paste the message URI into a TextEdit document, let it turn it into a hyperlink, then drag the hyperlink to a Finder window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The Finder should create a URL plist, with extension inetloc or a compatible extension. What you're supposed to get is a file that when you open it, opens the OS X Mail message.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The drag just bounces back to the source. The Finder creates nothing.\r\n\r\nNote: What I'd REALLY want to do is be able to drag the proxy icon from a Mail message to a Finder window, with a modifier key pressed, and have it create the URL file. As in, you're holding the modifier so that the Finder creates an \"alias\" (in the form of the URL file) of the source message.  That used to work, but stopped some versions of OS X ago.  If there's some secret shortcut for easily creating URL files to Mail messages now, I haven't found it."
