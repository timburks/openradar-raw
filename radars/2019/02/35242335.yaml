    description: "Summary: Docked folders will display hidden Icon files in the folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a folder somewhere.\r\n2. Drag the folder to the Dock.\r\n3. Right click the folder in the dock and select Sort By Date Added, Display as Stack, View Content as Automatic.\r\n4. Add a file to the folder that has a distinct icon. For example, create a normal TextEdit file in the folder.\r\n\r\nAt this point the dock will change to show the newly added document (in the above example, a RTF file). If you click on the folder in the dock, the stack will show that file and that file only.\r\n\r\n5. Now we need to create a hidden icon file in the folder. Right click the actual folder, Get Info\r\n6. Select the folder's icon at the top left corner of the Get Info box.\r\n7. Control-C to copy the icon to the clipboard.\r\n8. Control-V to paste it back, creating a custom icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expected result is no visible change to the folder's icon in the Dock.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the custom icon is created (or updated), the folder's icon in the Dock changes to a blank icon.\r\n\r\nAnd if you click on it to expand the stack, you now see that the folder contains a file \"Icon?\".\r\n\r\nBut if you select Open in Finder (from the Dock stack), the folder opens and the Icon? file isn't there, because it is a hidden file.\r\n\r\nSo the point here is that the *Dock* is displaying icons that the *Finder* knows should be hidden.  It should not do that; if the Finder is going to hide the file, then changes to the status of that file should have no visible effect in the docked folder.\r\n\r\nNote: This isn't a rare occurrence. I see it all the time in cases where a folder's custom icon is being regularly updated."
