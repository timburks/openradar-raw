    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n\tSince recent macOS versions, it is the new AVFoundation which handles the default MIDI playback in the macOS system (not the one shipped with QuickTime Player 7 anymore). However, at least in macOS High Sierra and macOS Mojave, there is an issue that when playing certain MIDI files (written for Sound Blaster) the AVFoundation may misidentify certain instrument patches as percussion patches, leading to unwanted playback result in those apps which utilize AVFoundation (AVMidiPlayer).\r\n\r\nP.S.: This may need to be reclassified as an issue of CoreAudio, according to your investigation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\t1. Prepare a MIDI playback software which utilizes AVFoundation (AVMidiPlayer) for MIDI Playback. It can be \"Sequences (sold on Mac App Store)\", \"MinimalMidiPlayer (available on GitHub)\", or the DLSMusicSynth Audio Unit in Logic Pro X.\r\n\r\n\t2. Use the application mentioned above to play these MIDI files from the Windows 95 version of Chinese Paladin (仙剑奇侠传) or its DOS version (MIDI extractable from MIDI.mkf): 017/034/039/040.mid\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\tOnly the MIDI channel 10 should be played as percussion track.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\tSome of the other channels are playing percussion patches. Such behavior is not expected.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\tmacOS 10.13.6 High Sierra (latest) running on a Hackintosh.\r\n\tmacOS 10.14.3 (18D109) running on MacBook Pro 15-inch mid-2017."
