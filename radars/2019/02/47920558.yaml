    description: "Area:\r\nApp Sandbox\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the user opens an alias file with NSOpenPanel, it resolves the file alias. And returns access to the resolved alias.\r\n\r\nBut when the user drags and drops an alias file into the application, -[NSPasteboard readObjectsForClasses:@[[NSURL class]] does NOT resolve the alias.\r\n\r\nWhile  [NSURL URLByResolvingAliasFileAtURL:url options:0 error:NULL] works, the sandbox denies access to the resolved alias.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Drop onto the App Dock Icon also resolves and grands access to the resolved alias, as expected.\r\n\r\nThe problem is only drops on custom NSViews. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) In Finder select a file, right click and \"Make Alias\"\r\n2) Drag alias file to an app accepting drag & drop ONTO a NSView\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp to open file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp can't open file\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14.3 (18D42)"
