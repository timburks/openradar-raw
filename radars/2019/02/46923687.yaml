    description: "There does not seem to be an easy way to *programmatically* (no UI control) choose to play back audio via AirPlay. This used to work, when AirPlay device ids were still exposed via CoreAudio. But apparently not anymore.\r\n\r\nThis makes it very hard to create sophisticated and modern audio applications for this platform. With the ubiquity of HomePods, Apple TVs etc. users require streaming capabilities like AirPlay.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\nrdar://23049205\r\nrdar://23089643 (http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5039701907996672)\r\nhttps://joris.kluivers.nl/blog/2012/07/25/per-application-airplay-in-mountain-lion/ (does not work anymore)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.14.1 (18B75)\r\n\r\nAnswer from Apple:\r\n\r\nPlease know that our engineering team has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the information provided.\r\n\r\nOur design is that switching to AirPlay should be user triggered action. We don’t want to allow apps to switch to AirPlay (which has to include deciding which device to AirPlay to) with “no UI control”."
