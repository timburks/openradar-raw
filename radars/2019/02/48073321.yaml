    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen custom keyboard calls UIInputViewController.textDocumentProxy.deleteBackward() to delete backward 1 character, UITextViewDelegate.textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementText:) is called with NSRange of length 1 regardless of the character's composition and UTF16 encoding length. For example, deleting \U0001F603 should have a NSRange of length 2.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, system keyboards give the correct NSRange.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Install the embedded custom keyboard in system Settings.\r\n3. Use the custom keyboard to delete the emojis. Read the console logs to see the NSRange with length 1.\r\n4. Relaunch the app.\r\n5. Use system keyboard to delete the emojis. Read the console logs to see the NSRange with length 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!5PY2HITJ!Lzq_eLttSERMgVx9Sz91GPOlSdUuqO62ujAsr7zZzoo"
