    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter being baffled by weird behavior in Sierra, I've finally pinned it down: the Finder is not handling the command key consistently when the machine is being remote controlled:\r\n- In some cases the command key is ignored\r\n- In some cases it doesn't toggle; it gets stuck in the \"on\" position\r\n\r\nI've seen the effects in two apps: keyboard viewer and the Finder. There could be others.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the Screen Sharing app to control a Sierra machine. I'm controlling a 2016 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 from a 2013 iMac running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\r\n\r\n2. Set a Finder window's View Options to icon view, arrange by none, sort by none.\r\n\r\n3. Drag an icon slightly with the command key pressed. It should snap to grid. But it doesn't.\r\n\r\n4. Change the view options to snap to grid.\r\n\r\n5. Drag an icon slightly with the command key held down. It should NOT snap to grid. But it does.\r\n\r\nThe next two tests are not repeatable ... sometimes it gets confused and thinks the command key is pressed when it isn't.\r\n6. In any Finder window, double-click a folder.  It should open in the same window.\r\n7. Double click a folder with the command key held down. It should open in a new window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe command key should toggle the current snap-to-grid setting.\r\n\r\nWhen opening a folder, the command key should cause it to open in a new window. If the command key is not pressed, it should open in the same window.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWhen remote controlling (via Screen Sharing) a Sierra computer, the command key toggle of snap-to-grid NEVER works.  This problem does not occur if a) not using Screen Sharing, or b) using Screen Sharing to control an El Capitan machine.\r\n\r\nOpening a folder has inconsistent results. Sometimes when the command key is pressed while Screen Sharing, it behaves correctly. Sometimes nothing happens at all -- it doesn't even open the folder.  Sometimes ALL folders you open will start opening a new window, even without pressing the command key.. it is like the Finder thinks the command key is pressed even when it isn't.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI also noticed that the Keyboard Viewer doesn't handle the shift, option or command key while under remote control: one you press such a key, it stays \"pressed\". This is not a new problem with Sierra.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt occurs when Sierra is being controlled view the built-in Screen Sharing."
