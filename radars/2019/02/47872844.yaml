    description: "Area:\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn the Watch app, under Sound and Haptics, there is a setting that allows covering the watch face to mute it. This allows, after getting a notification, for the user to hold their hand over the watch face for about 3 seconds and silence their watch. When this happens, it plays a vibration to confirm silencing. This is *working as intended and there are no issues here*, except that if the watch is already in silent mode, this results in seemingly random vibrations that don't change any settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave watch in silent mode\r\nreceive notification\r\ncover watch for 3 seconds and feel vibration\r\nno change has occurred as a result of this vibration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI wouldn't expect a vibration if I'm already in silent mode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt vibrates even though nothing has happened\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nwatchOS 5.1.3 (16S535)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSeries 4 + Cellular"
