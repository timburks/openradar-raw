    description: "Area:\r\nUserNotifications Framework\r\n\r\nOur application makes use of UNUserNotification framework for Local and Remote (Push) Notifications.\r\n\r\nOne of the requirement for the client is to 1st show an incoming call notification without sound and then replace it with the same incoming call notification with sound.\r\n\r\nAs a part of above process, here's what the application does:\r\n- Post a UNNotificationRequest with a request ID say X. The request's body is set to call information with no sound setting\r\n- After a while, when the application wants to start playing sound, it gets the delivered notification in the form of UNNotificationContent using the above request ID, modifies it (now contains sound information) and then re-triggers it\r\n\r\nThis newly triggered modified user notification cuts-off the sound and stops it after 1 or 2 secs itself"
