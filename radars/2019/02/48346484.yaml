    description: "Area:\r\nCore Data\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nFor an ordered relationship, Xcode forward-declares the selector `-insertFoos:atIndexes:` for both ObjC and Swift targets. This selector follows Cocoa/ObjC method naming conventions. Core Data doesn't actually implement this selector; it supports `insertFoos:AtIndexes:`, with the \"At\" in the second argument label capitalized. That selector doesn't follow Cocoa/ObjC method naming conventions. The mismatch between the two causes the ObjC runtime to trap in when using Xcode's generated selector.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download and open attached \"AtIndexesTest\" sample project.\r\n2. Build and run the \"AtIndexesTest\" scheme.\r\n3. In the window that appears, push the \"Explode!\" button.\r\n4. Observe the console log.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo errors occur. generated by Xcode match the ones Core Data supports. Both versions follow ObjC naming conventions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app code traps on attempting to call the misnamed method, possibly crashing.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 10.2 beta 3 (10P99q)\r\nmacOS 10.14.4 Beta (18E194d)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nOnly occurs for an ordered relationship.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds include changing the method signature manually. This is not a feasible workaround for a codebase relying on automatic code generation.\r\n\r\nIf Core Data is to be updated to fix the generated methods (which IMHO it should), such a fix is probably not back-deployable. Xcode would also need to be updated to emit the incorrect declaration for prior deployment targets."
