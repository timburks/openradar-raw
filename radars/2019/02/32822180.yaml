    description: "Summary:\r\nPre-Sierra, Mail had a command button to toggle the Junk status of a message, which presumably also affected the Junk filter training.  In Sierra, that option is gone. It is replaced with a command that either moves the message to the Junk folder, or moves it to the Inbox. But that is not the same thing as before, and so it has issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Move a message to the Junk folder.\r\n2. Attempt to mark the message as Junk\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to mark a message in the Junk folder as Junk\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt is not possible. The only available option is to move the message to the Inbox. But that's the opposite of what we're trying to do. What we want to do is mark a message that is IN the Junk folder AS Junk.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSierra 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSierra appears to be making the assumption that a) the only way a message would ever get into the Junk folder is if Mail put it there (with Junk status set), and b) that Mail on a particular Sierra machine is a world unto itself, with no other machines or web sites manipulating the same IMAP account. But that's not how IMAP works. So it is perfectly valid for a mail message to be moved to the Junk folder (e.g. by a mail filter) external to the Sierra Mail app, and then this app syncs to that IMAP account.\r\n\r\nSo, we can end up with a message that is not marked as Junk, but in the Junk folder.  Now the user wants to mark it as Junk, so they can be sure the Junk filter is trained on this machine. But they can't.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm testing using an IMAP mail account, not iCloud mail."
