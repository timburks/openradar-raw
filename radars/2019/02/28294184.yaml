    description: "Summary:\r\nPreviously in bug 17224229 I reported some problems with Time Machine in Mavericks and Yosemite:\r\n\r\n1. Files that were previously backed up to Time Machine would be dropped in later backup sets.\r\n\r\n2. Even after a deep traversal the Time Machine backup would still be out of sync with the source.\r\n\r\nApple reported that bug 17224229 was believed to be resolved in El Capitan, but I couldn't verify it then.\r\n\r\nI know have El Capitan 10.11.6 on my main machine, and my test shows that while the frequency of dropped files is reduced, the problem still does exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. A deep traversal was performed after the upgrade from Yosemite to El Capitan. There may have been another performed after that.  In any case, presumably Time Machine should be in sync at that point.\r\n\r\n2. I closed all the running applications, and\r\n\r\n3. I ran a Time Machine backup, and then\r\n\r\n4. sudo tmutil compare\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expected result would be that the only differences found by tmutil compare would be trivial differences or files that had been updated after the backup in step #3.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe actual result is that the last Time Machine backup is missing some files that haven't been updated on the source drive in over a year.\r\n\r\nI don't think it is as egregious as the discrepencies found in 17224229, but on the other hand, since many Applications were updated by the El Capitan install, perhaps there hasn't been enough time for more files to drop off the backup.\r\n\r\nHowever, really we should be shooting for zero missing files. There especially is no excuse for there to be missing files after a deep traversal; that's the 2nd issue reported previously, where for some unknown reason Time Machine wouldn't backup the file unless you forced it to by removing the parent folder from the backup and adding it back.\r\n\r\nNote: So far I'm not seeing the particular situation first reported in 17224229, where in the Preferences folder it would suddenly drop half the files from the backup. So maybe *that* problem is fixed.\r\n\r\nThe problem persists in macOS Sierra 10.12.6."
