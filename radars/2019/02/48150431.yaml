    description: "Area:\r\nHome Screen\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nRe-installing an offloaded apps from Search is a bad experience. There are no progress indicators showing the download/installation progress when the app is installing, and no way to pause or cancel that download. I attached a video capture showing what happens.\r\n\r\nThis is especially an issue when automatic app offloading is enabled, because reinstalling offloaded apps happens much more often in that case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Offload an app\r\n- Search for it in Spotlight\r\n- Tap the icon\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA progress indicator appears\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA \"Reinstalling <the app>\" alert view appears and there are no progress indicators. Only way to know if the download is done is to tap again and see if the app opens or if the alert view appears.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
