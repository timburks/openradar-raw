    description: "Please see the following referential cases when assessing this issue:\r\nCase #100704784158\r\nRADAR #46713486, 4152676, and 46713486\r\n\r\nWhile using Zoom's ZoomPresence.app, we are experiencing an issue whereby a user joining a meeting, or any graphics-related resource spike, results in macOS being forced to logout due to a crash in WindowServer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet a 2014-model Mac Mini running ZoomPresence.app, and two Samsung TV displays connected via HDMI, start a meeting, with no external participants. At some point >30s later, when a remote user joins the meeting this causes an uncaught exception in macOS's WindowServer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen a participant joins a meeting, and subsequently the device's graphics usage spikes, the device should remain in the same state it was prior. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUpon a user joining the call, WindowServer crashes, and thus puts the device at LoginWindow, thereby requiring user intervention to get the machine to a usable state.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nThis has been experienced on 10.13.4-10.13.6, as well as 10.14.0-10.14.3. Additionally, this issue has persisted across the 5 most-recent builds of ZoomPresence.app. As per previously mentioned cases/RADARs, Zoom has an ongoing investigation directly with Apple Development, and the aforementioned cases should be taken into account, as this is seemingly related to the change from OpenGL to Metal framework (or, at least, it aligns with the timeline of this change to macOS).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHardware:\r\nHardware Overview:\r\nModel Name: Mac mini\r\nModel Identifier: Macmini7,1\r\nProcessor Name: Intel Core i7\r\nProcessor Speed: 3 GHz\r\nNumber of Processors: 1\r\nTotal Number of Cores: 2\r\nL2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\r\nL3 Cache: 4 MB\r\nMemory: 16 GB\r\nBoot ROM Version: 236.0.0.0.0\r\nSMC Version (system): 2.24f32\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\nSystem Software Overview:\r\nSystem Version: macOS 10.14.2 (18C54)\r\nKernel Version: Darwin 18.2.0\r\nBoot Volume: Untitled\r\nBoot Mode: Normal\r\nSecure Virtual Memory: Enabled\r\nSystem Integrity Protection: Enabled"
