    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a Share extension that needs to know which app triggered it. The extension presents a list of apps and by knowing which app triggered it, it can prioritize that app in the list by moving it to the top.\n\nThere are also other use-cases for knowing this:\n- Working around an app sending buggy/weird NSExtensionItem attachments.\n- Improve heuristics for which NSExtensionItem attachments and representations to pick.\n- Let the user opt-into sharing which app originally made the shared item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected `NSExtensionContext` to have a `.sourceApp` property with the name (or `NSRunningApplication` instance) of the host/trigger app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo property like this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy current workaround is to use `NSWorkspace.shared.frontmostApplication`, but that has timing issues."
