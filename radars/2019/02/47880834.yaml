    description: "Area:\r\nApp Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI am testing DEP deployment. Right after MacBook enrolled into MDM. MDM server told the MacBook to install Device Assigned applications obtained through VPP. storedownloadd started downloading the applications but it crashed along the way. This left the user with bunch of . appdownload files in /Applications. When . appdownload is clicked Mac App Store app is opened with account page which is useless since applications in questing are device assigned. \r\n\r\nThere is a caching server on our network and from logs I can see MacBook was using caching server to download package installers. Also there was second unathorized caching server on the network when this happend.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a brand new install of 10.14.3 on machine with DEP\r\n2. Go through SetupAssistant and let it enroll the machine into MDM\r\n3. MDM tells the device to install Device Assigned applications.\r\n4. storedownloadd starts downloading packages (possible with use of Caching server)\r\n5. For some reason storedownloadd crashes\r\n6. Incomplete downloades end up as . appdownload placeholders\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmacOS automatically tries to download incomplete appdownload OR\r\nuser can direct macOS to resume these downlaods (VPP device assigned applicaton) manually.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are bunch of .appdownload files and confused user.\r\nAfter reboot download is not automatically atempted.\r\n\r\nFirst attempt to push those apps via MDM again ended with Mac App Store alert saying it's not possible to install something at this time (Sorry for not having this alert text it was in different language). After reboot I was able to reinitiate download by manually commanding the maching to install VPP apps.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14.3/18D42\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air 2018\r\nCaching server with advanced configuration (serving two subnets). Another (rogue) caching server on the network."
