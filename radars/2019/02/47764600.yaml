    description: "Area:\r\nWorkout\r\n\r\nIt's common when hiking to stop for extended periods of time, to have a drink and a snack, change clothing or just to take a photo of the view. This is unlike other types of workouts, such as cycling or running. \r\n\r\nDuring a Hiking workout, the Watch prompts too quickly to ask whether you have finished your workout - I'd suggest a 10 minute grace period before asking. \r\n\r\nI would also adjust how change in movement is calculated for a Hiking workout pause - I've been moving very very slowly, but up a very steep slope, and been prompted to see if the workout has finished. Perhaps heart rate and elevation could be factors - people tend to move a lot slower at altitude, but are still working really hard!\r\n\r\n(In California, it might not be a big deal to dismiss a dialog on the Watch, but when hiking in the Canadian winter, with the watch buried under six layers of clothing and mittens, it can get a bit frustrating \U0001F1E8\U0001F1E6\U0001F60B\U0001F3D4)\r\nComments"
