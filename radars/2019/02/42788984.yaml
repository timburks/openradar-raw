    description: "The IAP receipt contains many fields of relevant information, but one obvious piece of data that is missing is the price (and the corresponding priceLocale) that the user paid. It would help considerably if this information were added to the receipt.\r\n\r\nNot having this information makes our own internal reporting difficult. Since we are unable to obtain the actual price and priceLocale from the receipt, and as a US based company working primarily in USD, we currently attempt to work around this by just making a hardcoded assumption that all IAP purchases for a given product should be valued at the products equivalent USD price (the price at IAP product creation time, based on realtime currency conversions). However, this is not a good assumption on our part.\r\n\r\nWe recently discovered that the Brazil Real has fallen ~25% over the past few months relative to the USD, which means that not only are we making less money, but our reporting was unable to show it, because it doesn't account for currency fluctuations (since we don't know the price or priceLocale for purchases from the receipt).\r\n\r\nIn addition, App Store Connect allows us to modify the price of products on a per-store/country basis, so it's possible that 2 users in the same store/country will pay two different prices for the same product. This makes our internal reporting difficult, as we rely on the receipt as the source of truth.\r\n\r\nIf the price and priceLocale were available on the receipt, we could know exactly how much money are we earning from our IAP and store the correct amount, rather than just incorrectly assuming the USD equivalent.\r\n\r\nSee this for current receipt validation documentation, which does not include price or priceLocale:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW10\r\n\r\nNote that it is NOT sufficient for our app to send SKProduct.price and SKProduct.priceLocale to our server to store in our database for reporting purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter starting an IAP subscription, a user may decide to switch their active product within a subscription group. This happens entirely outside of our app, and thus we are unable to have the app send the corresponding price and priceLocale values to the server. When the subscription renews, the server will not know the exact price that the user paid since the values are not in the receipt.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if we decide to modify the price of a product (for example, lower the price, which means that all users on that active subscription will automatically renew at the lower price), when the subscription renews, our server will not know the price that the user paid for that and future renewal periods."
