    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen reconnecting a 2018 15\" MacBook Pro to an eGPU while the MacBook lid is closed causes the system to halt. Opening the lid reveals a completely shut down MacBook Pro. To turn it on again I have to hold the power button for a second or two. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. With the MacBook Pro connected to an eGPU and in clamshell mode (lid closed), go to the eGPU menulet and choose \"Disconnect AMD Radeon RX Vega 56\" (or whatever)\r\n\r\n2. I happen to have two displays connected, so I need to wait until displays have gone black (only takes a couple of seconds).\r\n\r\n3. Disconnect MacBook Pro from eGPU. Open lid and use normally.\r\n\r\n4. Close lid of MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\n5. Reconnect eGPU. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBoth screens should power back on and I should be able to continue using the computer. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBoth screens stay dark. Opening the lid of the MacBook Pro reveals it has completely shut down (blank touchbar, keyboard not backlit). Holding down the power button for 2 or 3 seconds starts bootup process. When bootup completes I am told that the system shut down because of a problem.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nMacBookPro15,1 with internal Radeon Pro 560X graphics \r\nmacOS 10.14.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nMantiz Venus eGPU chassis\r\nGigabyte Radeon RX Vega 56 Gaming OC 8G Graphic Card\r\nDell P2415Q primary display in landscape (looks like 1920x1080, default resolution) - DisplayPort connection\r\nDell UP2715K secondary display in portrait (looks like 1440x2560, default resolution but rotated) - dual DisplayPort connection\r\n\r\nSYSDIAGNOSE (taken after crash and subsequent bootup) ATTACHED"
