    description: "Summary:\r\nI received an email from Apple today which details the requirement that I enable 2-factor auth on my development account.\n\nThe thing is, I have an account from work, but have my own personal developer account tied to my own Apple ID (and iCloud).\n\nIn order to sign in after enabling 2-factor auth on the work account, I'd have to create a second account on my Mac and sign into it to approve any requests. Or sign out of my icloud account and sign in to the work account. Or something else.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIf I enable 2fa on my work developer account for http://developer.apple.com,\n\nI sign in to iCloud on my mac with my personal iCLoud account\nI create a second user account\nI sign in to iCloud on that second user account with the work developer account\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to receive authentication requests for more than one account while logged in to one macOS account (or iOS device)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNow I get notifications and can approve 2-factor requests, swapping back and forth between macOS user accounts whenever I need to approve one\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nNotes:"
