    description: "Summary:\r\nThis radar contains important security advice and is recommended for all users.\n\nFor information on the security content by me, please visit this website:\n\n\nhttps://pile.pjaspers.com/index-6qL0xs.html\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo cheating! You need to follow the link above, I needed to as well. After having done that, the radar should be clear. But I know, it's kind of a waste of your time and mine to have go through all the hoops just to get to the crux of the issue.\n\nSo please change your lackluster release notes (even for security updates) to at least contain the big ticket items that were fixed. It's perfectly fine to link to an external page for the nitty gritty. Definitely not fine to hide it all behind a link.\n\nIf you didn't click through, shame on you!, I made two webpages, much like:\n\n- https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\n- https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209520\n\nWhere the first one linked to the second one, and in the second was the actual content of this radar.\n\niOS has this thing called 'Software Update' which makes it easy for regular people to keep their OS up to date, and security patched. It even has an interface where Apple could potentially show you what's new in this update.\n\nThis would be a very neat way to keep users informed, and train them to be a bit weary when installing things. (OHAI impromptu 'Enter you Apple password here' prompts)\n\nUnfortunately, the powers that be decided, that instead of embedding this information directly into the thing that was designed to have this text embedded in it, it just shows vague wording and a link which takes you take a general site about security updates, so you need to figure out where look, and then you can get to the actual content of the Security Update\n\n It would have been so much simpler if I had just made my point in the actual interface, you wouldn't have had to worry about following links and the world would be a slightly better place.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1.4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
