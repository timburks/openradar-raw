    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes library sharing has a problem where the \"Show: Items not in my library\" function misses tracks, i.e. tracks should be displayed because they're not in the local library, but they are not.\r\n \r\nThis problem has existed going back many releases of iTunes; perhaps since the interaction of local library sharing.\r\n\r\nThe Reproducibility is high: this problem frequently occurs, but not 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable iTunes local library sharing on computer S (Source).\r\n2. On computer D (Destination) open iTunes and click the button to switch to viewing S's library.\r\n3. Show: Items not in my library.\r\n\r\nAt this point computer S has 3317 tracks, while computer D has only 3217: it is missing 100 tracks.  (The 3217 tracks are an exact match with the same tracks on the other computer; that is D does not contain anything not in S.)\r\n\r\nHowever, after selecting Show: Items not in my library, it only displays 89 tracks.  In fact, it is missing one complete album.\r\n\r\nNote: There is no rhyme or reason to what is missing. It is not unusual for it to be missing tracks out of the middle of an album.\r\n\r\n4. Select the displayed tracks. Click Import.\r\n\r\nAfter importing the 89 identified tracks, the list is empty -- it thinks that there are no tracks in computer S that are not in computer D. And yet, computer D's library now only has 3306 items -- it is still 11 short.\r\n\r\n5. Just to make sure it isn't a fluke, close iTunes on both computers and start over.\r\n\r\nIt still shows no items as missing, even though 11 are.\r\n\r\n[In this case the missing tracks were the album Glass: The Voyage]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen \"Show: Items not in my library\" is selected it should display all tracks that exist on the shared library but are not in the local library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe actual result is that the list is incomplete.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe work around is to:\r\n1. After importing, manually compare the library item counts to determine if anything was missed.\r\n2. If so, manually compare the item counts in each album that was transferred, one at a time.\r\n3. For each album that has a discrepancy, manually inspect the tracks to determine which tracks were missed.\r\n4. For each skipped track, browse the remote library again but this time with Show: All Items selected. \r\n5. Navigate to locate the missing track, select it, and Import\r\n\r\nRepeat until all skipped tracks have been transfered.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is a vanilla configuration:\r\n- All files are selected in iTunes\r\n- iTunes Match has never been used\r\n- Apple Music has never been used\r\n- All missing files are my own, ripped from CD. No DRM, no Purchased music\r\n- All missing files are Apple Lossless music files\r\n- All of the missing files are unique: they exist nowhere else in either library\r\n- The missing files are not identified as Duplicates in either library\r\n- There are no orphan files, meaning that every file that is in the Music folder is in fact still pointed to by the iTunes library\r\n- Automatic transfer is not selected\r\n- The computers are connected by gigabit Ethernet\r\n- There is no indication that the process has timed out or been interrupted in the middle\r\n- There are no obviously relevant messages in Console\r\n- There doesn't seem to be any reason why particular tracks would be skipped -- they are not unusual in any way that I can see"
