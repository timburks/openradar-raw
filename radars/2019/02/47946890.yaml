    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt is expected that custom `UIPresentationController` subclasses can lay out their content using Auto Layout, modulo the nuts and bolts of custom transitions or the content being driven by manual layout. Any lack of such a capability isn't documented, and DevPubs encourages it:\r\n\r\n> Apps that use auto layout should not need to do anything because the auto layout mechanism resizes views as needed.\r\n\r\nAdding constraints when setting up custom views in the `containerView` during `presentationTransitionWillBegin` works great.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when doing modal presentations on top of this custom transition. For instance, a subsequent full-screen presentation does something unexpected to move its `presentingViewController.view` into its hierarchy, which breaks any constraints.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download and open the attached sample project, `Layout.xcodeproj`.\r\n2. Run the \"Layout\" scheme on any iOS simulator or device.\r\n3. Tap \"Show Modal\".\r\n4. Tap \"Fullscreen Top Me\".\r\n5. Observer.\r\n\r\nA video of the issue is attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe full-screen view presents over the card view seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe full-screen view dismisses to reveal the the card view seamlessly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe card view jumps to an unexpected position on-screen as the full-screen presentation begins.\r\n\r\nThe card view jumps again to another unexpected position on-screen as the full-screen dismissal begins.\r\n\r\nThe card view disappears entirely as the full-screen dismissal ends.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\niOS 12.1.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn the attached sample project, uncomment CardPresenting.swift:37-39 for a workaround. Using `containerViewWillLayoutSubviews` felt wrong to me, as there's nothing explicit trying it to nested and presentation. If that is a fine place, or there is a better place, that should exist in the documentation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I suspect stealing back the view is a bad idea, but have no simple way to prevent re-activating the constraints in an invalid way. The workaround at least works as I'm expecting."
