    description: "Summary:\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207240 describes the only documented method for permanently displaying Fn keys on a MacBook Pro Touch Bar. When I follow the instructions for an app that I use, it does not work: when the app is active, the Touch Bar just displays Esc and the control strip; nothing else.\r\n\r\nDue to other UI changes, this means there is no way to use applications that are dependent upon Fn keys other than mashing the Fn key down with your finger, constantly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI followed the instructions given in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207240:\r\n \r\n1. In System Preferences, choose Keyboard.\r\n2. Click Shortcuts.\r\n3. From the left sidebar, select Function Keys.\r\n4. Click the “+” symbol, then navigate to the app and select it.\r\n \r\nIt did allow me to select the application.\r\n \r\nThen I launched the application and switched to it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the Touch Bar to show F1-F12 keys when the application has focus.\r\n\r\n(See Additional Notes for more discussion.)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWhen the application is switched to, the Touch Bar does not show F1-F12 keys.\r\n\r\nBefore this computer model, OS X had a preference (System Preferences > Keyboard > Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys) that set the Fn keys so that they were always F1-F12. This is an important option, because certain applications are HEAVILY dependent upon use of F1-F12.\r\n \r\nWhat this option lacked is the ability to be application-specific. But that need could be mitigated in two ways: 1) the option was scriptable through UI Scripting, so if you were smart, you could create an AppleScript that would toggle the setting, or 2) third-party applications such as Palua could automatically switch it based on which application had control.\r\n \r\nWith the Touch Bar, Apple purportedly created a built-in Palua like function, which should be a win. But there's three major issues:\r\n\r\n1. The new Palua like function doesn't work with all applications. My guess is that it only works with applications that use the Cocoa framework. Or some other secret sauce. That's annoying, but non-fatal, if we could still use third party solutions like Palua. But...\r\n\r\n2. Third party solutions such as Palua do not work at all; they can't seem to change the Fn key setting. That's probably because...\r\n\r\n3. Apple took away the global preference setting!\r\n\r\nIf the new built-in app-specific setting worked 100% of the time, then removing the Keyboard \"use all F1 etc. keys as standard function keys\" would be OK. But since the new built-in app-specific setting does NOT work 100% of the time, removing the previous global setting is devastating.  It means that for any app where it doesn't work, there is no other recourse. The only option left is to hold down the Fn key with your finder ALL THE TIME. \r\n\r\nAnd, I think the problem is bigger than just this one app. My experience as a Palua user is that certain types of apps are difficult to select and/or detect, such as those that are launched by another app, Java applets, monolithic Unix programs, etc.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhat we need is three things:\r\n \r\n1. The built-in app-specific selection for using Fn keys on Touch Bar should support all applications, not use Cocoa.\r\n\r\n2. Regardless of #1, we need to have the global \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" option back. The new app-specific function should not be the only way to force the Fn keys on all the time. And it is even more critical for apps that the built-in app-specific settings does not support.\r\n \r\n3. The \"use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" option should be UI scriptable as before. And whatever broke third-party applications such as Palua should be fixed, so that they can switch the Fn keys as before.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, tested with macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73). The app I'm testing with is a popular tn3270 client for macOS: http://www.brown.edu/cis/tn3270/."
