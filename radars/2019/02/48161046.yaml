    description: "In my personal contact card I have my mother connected to her contact card. \r\n\r\nWhen I ask Siri to \"Call mom.\" she ALWAYS asks \"Which 'mom'?\" and then lists both *me* and my mom as options rather than just calling her. \r\n\r\nIf I ask Siri \"who is my mother\", she correctly shows my mom's contact card. Same for if I ask \"who is mom\"."
