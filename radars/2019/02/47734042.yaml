    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen browsing the Developer Documentation in Xcode, the share button doesnâ€™t give you an option to open the URL in Safari, or to copy it to clipboard.\n\nI frequently browse the documentation and want to share it with someone, but will have to either do it by sharing it in a message and copying the URL, or by adding the URL to my reading list and copying it from there\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any page in the Developer Documentation in Xcode\n2. Use the share button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option to copy the url, or to open the url in Safari\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe options given do not include a direct copy of the underlying URL, eg. only given the option to indirectly share the URL\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
