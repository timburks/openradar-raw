    description: "The current Debug Console in Xcode is already quite powerful, but I think there's a lot of room for making it even better, and I think this is something myself and many other Developers would absolutely die over.\r\n\r\nFeature Suggestions:\r\n- Text Colors in Console Log Output\r\n- Font Styles (possibly a bad idea?) but being able to specify the font/weight/size/color of a log to enable more robust, dynamic and readable build output.\r\n- Improved Date/Time Parsing and Handling (Filter by time/date)\r\n- Improved Search (Ability to perform complex search queries based on keywords, times, log levels) with a UI around this like clickable bubbles.\r\n- Ability to output separators and elements that assist in breaking up logical sections of the logs.\r\n- Ability to attach a Log to a previous log, such as to assist in Logging Asynchronous events and keeping their connection. For example, as an Developer I could Log a Network Request being sent, then Log the Response and attach the incoming log to the previous outgoing log. And in the Debug Console, be able to easily see the coupling whereas currently logs can wipe each other out and make it difficult to scroll back through and find related logs.\r\n- Inline support for Log Levels. Such as the ability to filter based on a certain Log Level (Verbose, Info, Warn, Error...etc)\r\n- Separate Xcode/OS logs as a specific Log Level that can be filtered out by user.\r\n- Integration with above natively in Swift/Foundation such as in CustomDebugStringConvertible.\r\n\r\nSome of these ideas above might be considered kinda silly, I'm mostly just spitballing. But I think there are a few that people might really love.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
