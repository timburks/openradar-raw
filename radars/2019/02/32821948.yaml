    description: "Summary:\r\nUnlike the pre-Sierra Console, the Sierra Console doesn't show log files (except for system.log) in the Sources list. To view a log file, you must first click a folder, and then another pane appears with the files in that folder.\r\n \r\nThis behavior should be selectable: either work the way it does now, or the way it did before.\r\n\r\nI, for one, have many years experience with Console, but couldn't figure out why Sierra wasn't showing files that I knew were in the /var/log folder. It wasn't obvious at all that I needed to click on the /var/log folder itself before they would be visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Console in Sierra.\r\n2. Expand ~/Library/Logs, /Library/Logs or /var/log in the Source viewer.\r\n3. Observe that no log files are visible in the list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should have an option to view files in the list, sorted with the sub-folders in that log folder.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo log files are visible\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is more than just a discoverability issue.  In each of the main log folders (~/Library/Logs, /Library/Logs, /var/log) some applications create individual logs and some create sub folders. We should be able to scan this list alphabetically to find the application or process that we're interested in. But now you can't, because there are two separate list: the folders are in the first column, and (if you've clicked on the log folder) the individual files are in the second list. This is not user friendly."
