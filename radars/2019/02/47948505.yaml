    description: "Summary:\r\nRegular computer mice are the most popular kind of game controller. \n\nThey are of course supported on traditional computers, but XBox & PlayStation consoles and even the Nintendo Switch support mice as controllers.\n\nEntire categories of games such as 1st person shooters and real time strategy games cannot be played competitively without a mouse. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Ask the GCController to listen for game controllers.\n2) Turn on a bluetooth mouse and ask it to pair to a new device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to pair the mouse to the iPad and have this appear as a game controller of some (perhaps new) type.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to use mouse as an input device in iOS games.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.1.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is extremely wasteful that the powerful hardware of the iPad Pro can render high-end graphics as seen in Fortnite but because iOS does not support the most basic game controller, dedicated players would never play on iPad."
