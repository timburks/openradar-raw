    description: "We currently use an OSS component called FormatterKit specifically for formatting time intervals (e.g., a post occurred \"6h 15m ago\" or \"2 days ago\"). The key bit is the \"ago\" suffix in a locale-sensitive way.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mattt/FormatterKit/blob/master/FormatterKit/TTTTimeIntervalFormatter.h#L81\r\n\r\nDateComponentsFormatter provides rich formatting support, and include options for approximation & time remaining phrases. It would be great if it was enhanced to offer this support as well.\r\n\r\nI've attached a Swift playground for illustrative purposes, in the event that it proves useful. Thanks for your time and consideration!"
