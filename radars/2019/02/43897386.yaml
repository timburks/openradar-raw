    description: Listing a directory of a NFSv4 mount in Finder leads to a READDIR request that only requests a minimal set of attributes. The rest of the needed attributes are requested in subsequent GETATTR and ACCESS requests. For a large directory there many unnecessary requests issued which slows down the listing. To reduce the number of those requests you could extend the attr_request attribute in your READDIR requests to omit subsequent NFS reqeusts.
