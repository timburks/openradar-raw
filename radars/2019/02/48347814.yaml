    description: "Summary:\r\nSiri misreads the common idiom \"I'm not crying, you're crying,\" placing emphasis on the wrong words (\"crying\" instead of \"I'm\"/\"you're\"). This provides a poor user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send a message to your spouse with a link to the Nike ad \"Dream Crazier\" featuring Serena Williams (<>).\r\n2. While driving with the iPhone connected to CarPlay, receive a reply containing the text \"I’m not crying, you’re crying\".\r\n3. Ask Siri to read the message.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri reads the message as: *I'm* not crying, *YOU'RE* crying.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri reads the message as: I'm not *crying*. You're *crying*.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 8 Plus\r\n2018 Honda CR-V AWD EX-L"
