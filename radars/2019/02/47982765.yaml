    description: "I first encountered this in our production app, where a strong password is being suggested on a Login (not Sign Up) page. Setting `UITextContentType` to `.password` (as opposed to `.newPassword`) did not work to disable the suggestion, nor did setting it to non-password things like `.nickname`. I attached a screenshot of this behavior.\r\n\r\nI created a sample project where I mock this situation. In the sample project, when run on a physical device, everything on the Signup page suggests emails, and everything on the Login page suggests saved passwords, despite the `UITextContentType`s reflecting the appropriate type in the text fields on each page. (`.username` and `.newPassword`, `.username` and `.password`). I'm not getting suggested strong passwords, I assume because the test project doesn't have an associated domain. However, it still demonstrates the ineffectiveness of setting `UITextContentType` to guide OS suggestions.\r\n\r\nThis reproduces very consistently on physical devices, and much more rarely in Simulator."
