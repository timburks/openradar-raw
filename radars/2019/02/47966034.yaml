    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open attached sample project \"Safely\".\r\n2. Build and run \"Safely\" scheme on any iOS simulator or device that has non-zero safe areas.\r\n3. Tap to activate the text field at the top of the screen.\r\n4. Hide the software keyboard, either using the simulator or by connecting a hardware keyboard to a device.\r\n5. Rotate the device.\r\n6. Observe.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe toolbar extends its background into the safe area. Upon rotation, that extension updates for the new safe area.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe toolbar extends its background into the safe area. Upon rotation, that extension disappears. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Respond to `UIInputViewController.viewSafeAreaInsetsDidChange()` to call `toolbar.setNeedsLayout()`.\r\n\r\nSide note: Even with this specific issue addressed, the toolbar does not behave like other system controls intended to abut the edge of the screen. That it \"extends\" its background outside of its bounds instead its contents avoiding safe area is perplexing.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 10.1 (10B61)\r\niOS 12.1.3 \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A"
