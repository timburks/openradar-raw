    description: "There are currently sandbox entitlements for the Downloads, Pictures, Music, and Movies directories, but a very common (and forgotten) need is to be able to put something on the \"Desktop\". I propose adding a write-only \"Desktop\" sandbox entitlement. I don't need to read what the user has on their desktop. I just need to write. If there are name conflicts, just rename my file from `Foo` to `Foo 2` like Finder does.\r\n\r\nHaving this would solve so many use-cases. Right now, I have to inconvenience the user with an `NSOpenPanel` prompt...\r\n\r\nFor example, if you take a screenshot and right-click the floating screenshot thumbnail, you get some menu items: \"Save to Desktop\" and \"Save to Documents\". macOS obviously doesn't need an `NSOpenPanel` prompt for these, but third-party apps do. This is unfair and shows that there's a real need for this kind of entitlement."
