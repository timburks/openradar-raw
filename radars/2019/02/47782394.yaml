    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting a reminder for “10 to 10” should set a timer for 9:50, but will set a timer for 10:00 instead\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAsk Siri “remind me of milk at 10 to 5”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSets a reminder for 4:50am/pm\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSets a reminder for 10:00am/pm\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attachment. Not sure how “widespread” this issue is, as in how many permutation as incorrectly read. I know of “10 to 10” and “10 to 5” both resolving to 10:00."
