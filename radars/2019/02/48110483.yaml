    description: "The documentation states that \"title strings should be short, usually only a couple of words describing the reason for the notification.\"\r\n\r\nI contend that the current behavior is too strict, resulting in titles that limit the utility of the feature. The example images attached show that the title is truncated (with ellipsis) to one line, while the subtitle, which is characterized as less important, correctly wraps for many lines. A user has to use 3D Touch or other means to see the full, attributed content of the notification title.\r\n\r\nCould you please offer a way for us to support longer titles, whether through an attribute that toggles this treatment of the title, or via a new semantic \"longTitle\" attribute?"
