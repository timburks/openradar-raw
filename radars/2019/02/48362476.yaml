    description: "Area:\r\nControl Center\r\n\r\nSummary: Occasionally, when interacting with the Home widget in Control Center, it will get \"stuck\" on the screen, and I'm unable to dismiss it. See the attached video, where it's stuck, and I'm interacting with Siri. I've also accidentally called 911 without knowing it in this configuration, and been unable to hang up (because the UI is obstructed).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: I'm not sure how to reproduce, but I've encountered this twice now.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Should be able to dismiss Home widget\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: Home widget stays on screen even while interacting with the rest of the phone (see attached video, where I call up Siri)\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: 12.1.4 (16D57)"
