    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Finder has per-folder View Options that allow the user to set how to display the folder. For Icon view, the user can rearrange the icons.\r\n\r\nStarting with High Sierra, the view option settings for the Applications folder and its subfolders are lost when the Finder restarts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the Applications folder in Finder.\r\n2. View > as Icons\r\n3. View > Show View Options\r\n4. Sort by: None\r\n5. Sort by: Snap to Grid\r\n6. Spend the next 30 minutes organizing the Applications icons precisely how you want them to appear. For example, perhaps you want to organize them with the Apple built-in apps first, or by vendor, or by frequency of use, or whatever THE USER WANTS.\r\n7. Notice that the Finder maintains the user settings. We're all good, right?\r\n8. Wrong. Relaunch the Finder, or log out and back in, or restart the machine.\r\n9. Go back to the Applications window.\r\n10. Cry.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Finder view should be the same as it was before you relaunched the Finder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Finder view reverts to organizing by Name. Even if you change it back, the user organization is completely wiped out.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The Finder has remembered icon position across restarts in every version up until High Sierra. Specially, this does work in Sierra.\r\n- It does work in folders in the user's Documents folder.\r\n- Note that in Sierra and earlier, the Finder does sometimes forget icon position after an installer has run. I believe that this is due to the installer allowing the install package to override the hidden desktop file that holds the icon positions, which would be both a bug in the vendor's install package and a bug in the macOS Installer. But the difference here is that in High Sierra, the icon position is ALWAYS lost, even if no installer has run."
