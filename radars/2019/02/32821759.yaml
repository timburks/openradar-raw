    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you switch focus to/from the Calculator several times, the Calculator Touch Bar will stop appearing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Calculator app. The Touch Bar shows Calculator buttons.\r\n2. Click on the Desktop so the Finder is active. The Touch Bar is now blank, except for Esc and the control strip.\r\n3. Click on the Calculator again.  The Touch Bar shows the Calculator buttons again.\r\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 several more times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhenever the Calculator app has focus, the Touch Bar should show the Calculator buttons.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAfter switching away from Calculator enough times, when you switch back to it the Touch Bar will go blank. From this point on, no matter what you do, no more Calculator buttons on the Touch Bar.\r\n\r\nThe Touch Bar isn't dead: if you start another Touch Bar friendly app like Safari, it behaves normally. It is just the Calculator that it no longer responds to.\r\n\r\nQuitting Calculator and re-opening restores the Touch Bar functionality... for a little while."
