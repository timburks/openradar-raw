    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS Simulator Edit menu commands Get Pasteboard and Send Pasteboard are not clearly named.\n\nIs the Simulator getting the Mac pasteboard, or is the Mac setting the Simulator pasteboard? I can never remember which is which. They could be interpreted either way depending on the userâ€™s mental model. This would be a great example for a UX textbook of a pitfall to avoid.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to move things between the Mac and Simulator pasteboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe menu commands would have clear names like Send Mac Pasteboard to iOS Pasteboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user has to experiment to reverse engineer the mental model of the author of this text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
