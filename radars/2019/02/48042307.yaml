    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new screenshot UI in Mojave works great, however, the UX for sharing the screenshot could be better. When you right-click the floating screenshot window [1], you get a menu with some actions, for example, \"Open in Photos\", but these are hard-coded to just a few Apple apps. It would be much more useful for users if it had a \"Open With\" menu (like when right-clicking a file in Finder). That way the user could quickly open the screenshot in any third-party app. It would also be useful for users if they could share the screenshot right away with a system \"Share\" menu instead of first having to open the Quick Look preview and then clicking the share button there.\n\n[1]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117983/52724171-72c90800-2f74-11e9-9b4c-6468dca6a924.png\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a screenshot and then right-click the floating screenshot window at the bottom-right of the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected this menu to have a \"Open With\" and \"Share\" menu item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't, so sharing a screenshot with a service or editing it further in a third-party app becomes harder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelevant GitHub issue: https://github.com/sindresorhus/gifski-app/issues/62"
