    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n\"Disconnect (eGPU)\" with dual displays attached sometimes does not complete. One display remains powered on and it is possible to move the cursor around it (however none of the UI elements on the display can be selected or interacted with). Subsequently unplugging the eGPU cable causes the Mac to logout immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. With the MacBook Pro connected to an eGPU and in clamshell mode (lid closed), dual external monitors attached, go to the eGPU menulet and choose \"Disconnect AMD Radeon RX Vega 56\" (or whatever)\r\n\r\n2. Wait for the disconnection to complete. Sometimes only one monitor goes dark and the second monitor stays on, with a movable mouse cursor. Controls on that display cannot be clicked or interacted with.\r\n\r\n3. Disconnect MacBook Pro from eGPU. Open MacBook lid and it is logged out and back on the login screen. Logging in again starts launching the programs that were running prior to disconnecting the eGPU.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen disconnecting eGPU both monitors should go dark. Then unplugging the eGPU should keep the MacBook logged in with all apps at the same state where they were before.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOne screen goes dark (the secondary external display) and one screen stays on (primary external display). It is still possible to move the cursor around the primary display but impossible to interact with the menu bar or anything else on the screen. Unplugging the eGPU causes the Mac to immediately return to the login screen with all apps closed. Logging in again relaunches the apps fresh.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nMacBookPro15,1 with internal Radeon Pro 560X graphics \r\nmacOS 10.14.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nMantiz Venus eGPU chassis\r\nGigabyte Radeon RX Vega 56 Gaming OC 8G Graphic Card\r\nDell P2415Q primary display in landscape (looks like 1920x1080, default resolution) - DisplayPort connection\r\nDell UP2715K secondary display in portrait (looks like 1440x2560, default resolution but rotated) - dual DisplayPort connection\r\n\r\nMAY BE RELATED TO rdar://47808946 (filed yesterday)\r\n\r\nSYSDIAGNOSE (taken after re-login) ATTACHED"
