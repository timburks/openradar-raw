    description: "Trying to open a pdf sent in a Messages chat yesterday. \r\n\r\nDouble clicking the icon does nothing. \r\n\r\nTo open the file (without dragging the icon to the desktop), you need to right click and choose Open under the Services menu, far from ergonomic. This opens an anonymous, icon-less dialog box with \"Run Service\" as the destructive choice. \r\n\r\nIf I didn't know better, it would look as if someone had sent me a dodgy app that I was then doing my best to install. \r\n\r\nThis flow doesn't seem to happen when trying to open a pdf immediately. It feels like Messages loses information about the type of file over time and so doesn't know it's safe to open. But for inexperienced users, this would be confusing."
