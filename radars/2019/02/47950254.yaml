    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have been using the DeviceCheck API to verify that requests to my server are coming from devices running my app. On or about February 7, 2019, my requests to api.devicecheck.apple.com started failing with 401 status codes and the text \"Unable to verify authorization token\".\r\n\r\nI attached a curl command for a request I initially sent on February 10, 2019, at 19:22:47 UTC.\r\n\r\nThe authorization token was:\r\n\r\n[REDACTED]\r\n\r\nMy JWT library decoded that token as having the following data:\r\n\r\npayload: {\"iss\"=>\"[REDACTED]\", \"iat\"=>1549826566}\r\nheader: {\"alg\"=>\"ES256\", \"kid\"=>\"[REDACTED]\"}\r\n\r\nMy Key ID is \"[REDACTED]\" and my Team ID is \"[REDACTED]\".\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong, or is there a reason that api.devicecheck.apple.com would stop accepting my DeviceCheck API tokens?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Issue the curl command from the attachment.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expected the server to return a 200 response.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt returned a 401 response with the text \"Unable to verify authorization token\".\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nI don't have a version number for the server, but tokens generated by my code stopped working on or about February 7, 2019.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A"
