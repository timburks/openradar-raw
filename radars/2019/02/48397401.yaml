    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt appears that the original named color (color from assets) set in storyboard is being cached when rotation occurs.\r\nIf a view's background is changed during the app lifecycle it will reset once the rotation occurs.\r\nThis issue doesn't occur if the original color isn't from assets or if the original view's background color is configured in viewDidLoad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new single view app.\r\nAdd a color resource to assets.\r\nIn storyboard set the view's background color to the color added in assets.\r\nOverride viewDidAppear and set a different color there.\r\nRotate device to landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView's background is the most recently set color.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nView's background is the original named color.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.x, iOS 12.x\r\nI haven't tested on older iOS versions.\r\nIt also occurs on both the simulator and the devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuplicate of: 34825863"
