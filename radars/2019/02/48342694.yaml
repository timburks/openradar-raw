    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen upgrading to 10.14 with `startosinstall` and issuing with `sudo` the install process does not complete without first having a user enter credentials mid-way thru the process.  The installation starts and at one point the Mojave loginwindow appears.  When credentials are supplied the the upgrade progress display reappears and finishes the installation.  This is an issue in that it requires a user to authenticate for the OS to complete the upgrade and takes up the users time to allow the installation to finish.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall 10.12.6\r\nEnable SSH\r\nDownload 10.14.3 installer from AppStore\r\nLog out of the 10.12.6 machine so it is at the loginwindow\r\nSSH to 10.12.6 machine\r\nRun sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --agreetolicense\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMojave would install completely\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nComputer starts the OS install\r\nDuring the process a Mojave based login prompt appears for the user\r\nEntering the user credentials brings back the OS install progress bar now stating about 15-13 minutes remaining\r\n\r\nThe issue is when the startosinstall command is issued with “sudo”, which in many managed environments to force an upgrade to Mojave would happen.  \r\n\r\nSetup a 2nd test where startosinstall is issued in Terminal without using `sudo` while logged in as the user account of the computer.\r\nThat command prompted for credentials to “add a new helper tool.”\r\nI provided credentials and clicked Add Helper button.\r\nDuring the install it did not stop to ask for credentials to proceed with the installation."
