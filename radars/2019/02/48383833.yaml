    description: "Summary: \r\nAlmost 100% reproducible for me. I have to save my work every time before I try to do at this point -- so that gives you and idea of the frequency at which this happens (a lot).\r\n\r\nWhen I Alt-Click on a file in the Project Navigator, Xcode crashes instead of opening it in the Assistant Editor. \r\n\r\nHard crash. Get the dump with the Reopen button (I don't).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. While working in Xcode, Alt-Click on a file in the Project Navigator. \r\n2. Xcode crashes instead of opening it in the Assistant Editor.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce just while writing up this report. Attached the crash report for your perusal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should open the file in the Assistant Editor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode goes belly-up.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nCurrently happening in Xcode Version 10.1 (10B61).\r\nHas been occurring for some time... definitely all Xcode 10 versions."
