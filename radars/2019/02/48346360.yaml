    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSimply creating a custom `UICollectionViewCell` subclass with a xib file, adding a view in it and setting a width smaller than the desired runtime one, it causes it to load with that width on iPads running iOS 10 or 11, even though the `estimatedItemSize` and `sizeForItemAtIndexPath` are correctly set / implemented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Open https://github.com/revolter/IncorrectCollectionViewCellWidth in Xcode\r\n- Run it on an iPad with iOS 10 or 11\r\n- Tap the \"Start\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe cells' width should be equal to the collection view width, as logged in the console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe cells' width is exactly as set in the xib file in Interface Builder, even though that value should be considered a preview only value.\r\n\r\n- You can uninstall the stack view and install the view with the same effect.\r\n- You can change the collection view cell's width from 355 to something like 500 and it will be used at runtime too.\r\n\r\nUninstalling both the stack view and the view \"fixes\" it and causes the cells to have the correct width."
