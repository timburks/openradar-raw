    description: "Summary:\r\nTitle says it all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode.\n2. Choose File → New → Playground…\n3. Choose macOS → Blank.\n4. Save it on the desktop as CrashDemo.playground.\n5. Press Command-1 to show the File Inspector.\n6. Right-click the CrashDemo playground and choose New Playground Page.\n7. Press Return to accept the default name of “Untitled Page 2”. You will also see “Untitled Page” below it.\n8. Option-drag Untitled Page 2 under the CrashDemo top-level entry with intent to duplicate this new page to make a third page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page is duplicated and a new name is chosen, just like if you duplicate a file in the Finder by Option-dragging it within the same parent folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes when you release the mouse button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.2 (10P91b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt looks like this is specifically disallowed in Xcode currently, because the crash log contains the text: :Can only copy groups, not _IDEPlaygroundPageFileReference”. So Xcode should either guard against this more directly, or support it as a feature.\n\nReproducible in Xcode 10.1 and 10.2 beta 2. Crash log also uploaded at https://cl.ly/319931578f8d"
