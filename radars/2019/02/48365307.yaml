    description: "There is certain system information that most apps will need, but it currently requires a lot of ugly and fragile low-level code to get it. Would be nice if the most common things could be exposed as a set of coherent APIs. Maybe under a `System` namespace.\r\n\r\nI propose starting with the following system info:\r\n\r\n- Model identifier\r\n\tExample: `MacBookPro11,3`\r\n- Model marketing name\r\n\tExample: `MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)`\r\n\tIt's currently impossible to get this information other than hardcoding it or calling private APIs. It can be useful for crash/bug reports.\r\n- Device ID\r\n\tLike using `kIOPlatformUUIDKey`\r\n- Serial number\r\n\tLike using `kIOPlatformSerialNumberKey`\r\n- Device type\r\n\tCould be an enum: `.laptop`, `.desktop`, `.tablet`, `.phone`\r\n- Device icon\r\n\tThere's no way to get the icon of the current device without using private APIs"
