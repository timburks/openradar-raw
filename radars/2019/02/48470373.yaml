    description: "Currently when asking Siri about your car, which triggers INGetCarPowerLevelStatus, Siri reads out the minutes remaining until fully charged as the number of minutes, instead of formatting it using a DateFormatter or DateComponentsFormatter to make it into a nice value.\r\n\r\nFor example, siri will say \"Time to full charge is 135 minutes\" which is not nice for the end user as they have to work out what that means in hours to understand when it ends. Saying something like \"It will be fully charged in 2 hours and 15 minutes\" or \"It will be fully charged by 5:30pm\" would be much nicer."
