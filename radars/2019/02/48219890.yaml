    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the iOS keyboard to dictate languages. If Chinese is selected, Mandarin is occasionally selected instead of Cantonese. This is despite having manually switched to Cantonese multiple times.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been reported publicly in a previous iOS as well, e.g.:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8075450\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add Cantonese as a Dictation Option\r\n2. Select Cantonese as the dictation option instead of Mandarin\r\n3. (Let time pass / use iPhone normally for a few days ) (Not exactly sure what causes the reset)\r\n4. See Dictation Options, see that Mandarin is selected instead of Cantonese\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• Dictation Option should stay as Cantonese, not randomly switch to Mandarin.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• After some time, the Dictation Option for Chinese switched to Mandarin instead of staying as Cantonese.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n• Version: 12.1.2\r\n• Model: MN4W2X/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n• iPhone Language: English\r\n• Siri Input Language: English (Australia)\r\n• Siri Voice: Australian (Male)\r\n• Accessibility > Speech > Chinese: Sin-ji (Hong Kong Voice)"
