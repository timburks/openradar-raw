    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApplication callbacks such as applicationDidEnterBackground: and applicationWillResignActive: aren't called with connected external display (CarPlay)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the application\r\n2. Connect External Display (CarPlay)\r\n3. Press Home to discard CarPlay Lock screen\r\n4. Swipe from the top to bottom to show Notification panel\r\n5. Use side button to put the iPhone into sleep mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince Step (4) finishes with applicationWillResignActive: as a last triggered callback, Step (5) should end on either applicationWillResignActive: or applicationDidEnterBackground:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeither applicationWillResignActive: nor applicationDidEnterBackground: triggered. Only applicationDidBecomeActive: is called. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X / XS (devices and simulators as well)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSuch behavior makes impossible to keep a proper rendering lifecycle described in the https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/ImplementingaMultitasking-awareOpenGLESApplication/ImplementingaMultitasking-awareOpenGLESApplication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH5-SW1\r\n\r\nSince app behavior with and without CarPlay is different and application callbacks are the only way to know what the user is doing at the moment, thus the app continue rendering as in the active state. Which results in the inefficient performance and unstable rendering."
