    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for UIView’s mask property is lacking in some key areas and could use an update. There should be 2 main points added to the docs in helping with usage:\n\n1. The masking view cannot be referenced by anything other than the view it will be masking.\n2. The mask view cannot be part of the view hierarchy, and thus cannot be manipulated with Auto Layout.\n\n#1 is the reason for #2, but with so many views getting converted to Auto Layout it bears calling out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead the docs for UIView’s mask property. They are located here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622557-mask\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should tell me how to use the property\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI had to figure things out for myself\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI wrote this up as a blog post available at https://jsorge.net/2019/02/04/uiview-mask-safety-scissors"
