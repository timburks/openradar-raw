    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now you must have a project open to attach debugger to a process. It doesn't matter which project, it just must be a project. This doesn't seem to make any sense if I just want to attach to a process by ID to debug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch Xcode\n2) Go to Debug>Attach to Process and see no processes\n3) Create a new project (File > New > Project)\n4) Go to Debug>Attach to Process and now you can debug\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI shouldn't need a random project open\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI need a project\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ngoogler:dmaclach"
