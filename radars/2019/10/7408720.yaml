    description: "Reason to reopen:\r\n\r\nWe continue to see crashes in the VectorKit code. In the last crash report, Apple mentioned that it was fixed in iOS 12.\r\nWe provided Apple the confidential files with a crash report and diagnostic overview. They show that iOS 12 and 13 still have this issue.\r\nNow we are waiting for an explanation about the current status for this crash and any plans to fix it.\r\n\r\nApple Feedback number is FB7408720\r\n\r\n***********************************************\r\n↓↓↓ Old radar https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6146190257160192 ↓↓↓\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe found that the test app crashes when it's releasing a MKMapView object at the render process. The map has a hybrid style and rendering only the Apple's tiles.\r\nMost of the time it happens after second attempt when tiles are cached.\r\nPlease run the attached test app and check the crash logs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open app on iOS 11.\r\n2) Tap the 'Show Map Screen' button\r\n3) The Map View Controller is appeared\r\n4) The map rendered all tiles\r\n5) Tap the 'Close Map' button\r\n6) Quickly repeat open/close the map screen\r\n\r\nIf you installed the test app first time please wait to cache Apple's tiles (You need to see them on the map). If you can not crash then re-run app and try on the device too. If you are not lucky then use the marks in the MapViewController class. Please follow them and uncomment necessary lines of code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould not be a crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe crash happens in 2-8 attempts.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nThe source code is attached.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 11 on iPhone/iPad device\r\n\r\nProject here: https://github.com/dedmakarMD/Texture2D_Crash\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEmail from Apple:\r\n\r\n\"Hello Anatoli,\r\n\r\nThere has been a status change for an issue you reported in Bug ID 40739139. \r\n\r\nThe original bug report is now awaiting final verification.
