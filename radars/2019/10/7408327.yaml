    description: "The Breathe app doesn't show the total number of mindful minutes for the day within the app. This is incorrect in two places. \r\n1. The initial screen within the Breathe app. \r\n2. The summary screen when you've finished a breathe (breathing?) session. \r\n\r\nOn the initial screen within the Breathe app, it always says \"0 min today\" even though I've used the app for a given time today. In fact, underneath that label, it says \"Last on 9/19/19\" which is not true. \r\n\r\nOn the summary screen, it only shows the time you've spent during this session. It will say \"So far today xmin\" with x being the number of minutes for this session. Not the total for the day. \r\n\r\nThe watch face complication itself tracks the number of minutes without issue. The Health app (on iOS) also tracks the number of minutes without issue."
