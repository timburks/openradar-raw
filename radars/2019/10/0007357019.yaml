    description: "FB7357019\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nSwiftUI Framework\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nWhen a SwiftUI view’s ObservedObject is changed, the view is reloaded with the new data. However this new data doesn’t seem to be propagated to the content of a NavigationLink on watchOS. Works as expected on iOS.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nOption 1: Run the attached project’s watchOS and iOS targets\r\nOption 2: Setup an observed object that gets updated from the main view. Use the data from that constantly updated object in the content of a NavigationLink.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nThe content of the NavigationLink should keep getting updated as the data is changed.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nOn iOS, it worked as expected. On watchOS, the content doesn’t update. It stays frozen on the last data at the time the NavigationLink’s content was loaded. One odd thing also is that if I set a breakpoint in the content of the NavigationLink, it does get updated.\r\n\r\nVideo showing issue: https://dsc.cloud/felix/Screen-Recording-2019-10-07-at-6.11.50-PM.mov\r\nXcode project: https://dsc.cloud/felix/NavigationPopBug-4.zip"
