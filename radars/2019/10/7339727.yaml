    description: "When setting an endlessly repeating image animation on WKInterfaceImage using the setImageNamed and startAnimatingWithImages methods, the application will crash with a EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception when the WKInterfaceImage instance in question is deallocated (for example when the owning interface controller is popped off of the navigation stack).\r\n\r\nThe code used to configure the WKInterfaceImage is as follows:\r\n\r\nimage.setImageNamed(\"spinner\")\r\nimage.startAnimatingWithImages(in: NSRange(location: 0, length: 6), duration: 0.75, repeatCount: 0)\r\n\r\nThe crash does not seem to occur if a value other than zero is specified for the repeatCount parameter.\r\n\r\nEnabling the Zombie Objects diagnostic setting and running the application gives a clue as to the cause of the crash. In the console output at the time of the crash the following message can be seen:\r\n\r\n2019-10-02 10:34:35.621736+1300 Animation Sample WatchKit Extension[20236:20196195] *** -[SPInterfaceImageView release]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x801c67f0\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached sample project to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Run the sample application.\r\n- Tap the button labeled \"Push\" to push another interface controller onto the navigation stack.\r\n- Press the back button to go back to the previous screen.\r\n- Application crashes (sometimes these steps must be repeated once or twice before a crash occurs).\r\n\r\nTested on Apple Watch Series 5 44mm simulator (watchOS 6) using Xcode 11.1 (11A1027)"
