    description: "Please describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n1. Use a VPN app that provides Personal VPN configurations.\r\n2. Enable VPN connection.\r\n3. Use a VPN app that provides Managed VPN.\r\n4. Enable Managed VPN connection while Personal VPN is connected.\r\n5. Delete Managed VPN profile from settings.\r\n\r\nResult: The VPN app using Personal VPN can no longer establish connection. iOS might show VPN as connected, but the tunnel is not actually established.\r\n\r\nRebooting the device seems to be the only way to fix the issue, if Personal VPN app doesn't offer any Managed VPN options.\r\n\r\nTested with these combinations:\r\nFreedome VPN + VPN by Private Internet Access\r\nFreedome VPN + 1.1.1.1 Warp \r\n1.1.1.1 Warp + VPN by Private Internet Access\r\n\r\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/f-secure-freedome-vpn/id771791010\r\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627\r\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/private-internet-access-anonymous/id955626407"
