    description: "The documentation for password autofill says that you should add your <Team Identifier>.<Bundle Identifier>  to your Apple App Site Association file. While this is sometimes true, your app may send the <App Identifier>.<Bundle Identifier> instead so the documentation should reflect this. In the case of my app, it sends up the app identifier instead of the team identifier and that causes the feature not to work despite following the documentation.\r\n\r\nLine in the â€‹documentation:\r\nUse the following format for the app identifiers:\r\n<Team Identifier>.<Bundle Identifier>\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nThis was discovered by seeing the app I am developing was sending the app identifier in requests in the console when trying to get password autofill info.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI'd expect the documentation to call out that it can be both/or either  <Team Identifier>.<Bundle Identifier> and <App Identifier>.<Bundle Identifier>.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe documentation does not reflect what the app will send to requests for password autofill so the feature will not work. Please update to include that is could be the <App Identifier>."
