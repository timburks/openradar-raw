    description: "We are experiencing an issue with CallKit integration: if the name of the contact from the incoming call is very long the font used for the label presenting the contact name is very small. This behavior is only visible on iOS 13. Prior iOS 13 update the label was scrolling text horizontally so there would be no data loss. \r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n- call -[CXProvider reportNewIncomingCallWithUUID:update:completion:] with CXUpdate object that has very long string in localizedCallerName property\r\n- observe result\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: \r\nCallKit UI screen is presented where contact's name is clearly visible\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nCallKit UI screen is presented, but contact label uses tiny font making the contact name essentially almost invisible\r\n\r\nUPD. Fixed in iOS 13.2.3"
