    description: "Allow macOS security API necessary for Mac App Store receipt validation to be available to iOS apps running on macOS via Catalyst.   These should include  the API defined in:\r\n\r\n<Security/CMSDecoder.h>\r\n<Security/SecAsn1Coder.h>\r\n<Security/SecAsn1Templates.h>\r\n<Security/SecRequirement.h>\r\n\r\nWithout these API, any Catalyst app that is being distributed through the Mac App Store will have to implement copy protection either by including a library like OpenSSL (50 MB), or by accessing the native framework API through a macOS plugin that is loaded by the main Catalyst bundle.   The plugin approach will allow access to the native API, but at the obvious cost of being considerably less secure.  The necessary API are already on the macOS platform.  If they were simply made available to the Catalyst app (probably just a matter of making them not unavailable) then the security functions could be run from within the main bundle and will thereby be harder to hack than requiring the main bundle to call into a plugin which is easily observed and replaced."
