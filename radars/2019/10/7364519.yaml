    description: "The documentation for LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType() does not give any indication of which types are allowed or are not allowed. At some point in the recent past (I assume quite likely because we've switched our app to the macOS Hardened Runtime so we can comply with the new Notarization rules) we've started getting a -54 (permErr) response from LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType() when the UTI is kUTTypeHTML.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that this is intended behaviour, could we have a note in the API docs that indicates this is intended behaviour, and any other types that are no longer allowed to be registered?"
