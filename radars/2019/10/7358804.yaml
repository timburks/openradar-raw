    description: "UITextField configured to input phone numbers(digits only) doesn't present suggestions at the top of the keyboard in iOS 13(13.1.2 included), the same text field has suggestions in iOS 12.\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have an UITextField for phone number input. These are the settings, all the rest is kept to default:\r\nself.textField.keyboardType = .phonePad\r\nself.textField.textContentType = .telephoneNumber\r\n2. Make focus on the textfield\r\n3.\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nSee suggestions at the top of the keyboard.\r\nActional result:\r\nNo suggestions view\r\n\r\nNote: Changing keyboard type to UIKeyboardTypeNamePhonePad brings suggestions back, but it doesn't fit our phone filed's logic, we can't use it as a solution."
