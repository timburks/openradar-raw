    description: "Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n- Set a breakpoint on a line\r\n- Add a condition to it (preferably, one that takes some time to evaluate, or on a line that gets called many times)\r\n- Disable it\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nFor the condition not to be evaluated at all.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe condition is incorrectly evaluated, when it shouldn't, possibly slowing down the app."
