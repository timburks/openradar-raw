    description: "Under the new iOS13 guidelines I understand that we should have access to the current connected SSID if we configure that SSID connection via NEHotspotConfigurationManager. \r\n\r\nOur app asks the user to connect to our Wifi network using the NEHotspotConfigurationManager, after a successful connection *sometimes* we can then access the SSID via the key kCNNetworkInfoKeySSID and other times that key returns a nil value. At this time rebooting the device seems to fix it to make the SSID visible again.\r\n\r\nWe see this on iOS13 (13.1, 13.1.2) iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone 11 devices."
