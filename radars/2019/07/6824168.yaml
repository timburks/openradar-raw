    description: When running a bot on Xcode 10.3 in Mojave 10.14.5, the build fails with a message "unable to spawn process (Argument list too long)". If I run a manual archive from the bot checkout location in  Library/Caches/XCSBuilder/Bots/, I get the same compilation error. Moving the same project to a more shallow location in the file system will let the archive succeed. Since we have no control over where Xcode Bots checks out its artifacts, we are unable to fix this issue. The same project was successfully building for months on High Sierra before we upgraded the build server to Mojave. The same behavior occurs on my local MacBook and on the build server (Mac Mini). Both systems are running the same version of Mojave. I have also tested this in the latest beta of Xcode (beta 4), and have observed the same behavior.
