    description: "There are a number of workflows that require booting into Recovery and launching Terminal to enter commands. This includes things like `csrutil` or using `diskutil` to perform various systems administration tasks. It would be a nice quality-of-life time saving feature to include a keyboard shortcut to allow Terminal to be launched without needing to use a mouse or the CTRL + [FN]F2 accessibility shortcuts to navigate then menus with your keyboard.\r\n\r\nMy first thought would be to include this keyboard shortcut in the \"macOS Utilities\" app that is first launched when booting into Recovery."
