    description: "We have an app for tvOS which uses a network tv tuner device to display broadcast television feeds.\r\n\r\nIn the U.K., broadcast video is 25fps or 50fps. Users who have their Apple TV set to 60hz see judder effects when watching TV in our app.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the user changes the Apple TV to 50hz output, our app works great. But then other apps like Netflix and iTunes show juddering effects as all the other apps show 30/60fps video.\r\n\r\nIs there any API or technique available to control the display refresh rate, so that the user can leave their Apple TV on \"Auto\" and we can force 50hz for our app?"
