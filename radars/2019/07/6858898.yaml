    description: "UNNotificationServiceExtension allows to edit the content of a remote notification before it is delivered to the user.\r\n\r\nI had often the need to filter notifications on the client, e.g. based on .categoryIdentifier. But the documentation clearly states:\r\n> If the content object does not contain any alert text, the system ignores your modifications and delivers the original notification content.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to revisit this decision and allow developers (or users like on Android) to mute several categories."
