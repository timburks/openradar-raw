    description: "Basic Information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nXcode 11 beta 5 my Derived Attribute is no longer being updated\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nCore Data API\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nI was going to submit this sample project to suggest that it would more useful if Derived Attributes were updated on DidChange rather than DidSave, so the new value can be accessed in NSFetchedResultsControllers didChangeObject, however when just updating to Xcode 11 beta 5 it seems the derived attribute I have is not being updated at all.\r\n\r\nRun the attached sample project on the iPhone 8 Plus simulator in landscape. Tap the plus to add an Event which will appear in the Master table, then select that row. Then tap the plus in the Detail table to add an Attendee. The Master cell has a subtitle that is configured to show the derived attribute attendeeCount which in the model editor is set to attendees.@count. However when adding attendees the attendee count is not updated. Relaunching the app causes the count to be shown on the cell.\r\n\r\nWhen the app was previously working the issue is that when adding attendees the attendeeCount was not the correct number. For example when the event object had 6 attendees the attendeeCount was 5, one less. I would prefer if when an attendee is added the attendeeCount is updated immediately."
