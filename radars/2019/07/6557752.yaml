    description: "Enable root user, and log into the machine in a GUI session as root. Save or copy a file to the desktop or to a directory hierarchy on the desktop. Try to open that file, and the application will hang.\r\n\r\nDirectories and aliases on the desktop can be browsed without issue. Aliases to files will open without issue, but opening any file under /var/root/desktop/ will cause a complete application hang. If the file is double-clicked, Finder will hang. If browsed to from File>open, the requesting app will hang. A force restart of the application is required to recover.\r\n\r\nTerminal is able to successfully CAT a file, but OPEN results in the target app hanging, just as if having used  File > Open.\r\n\r\nThis has been 100% consistently duplicated across 3 machines on 10.14.5 18F132 with different origins, histories and upgrade paths. Whether or not system integrity protection is enabled does not matter. The root home directory being wiped and recreated in many iterations has made no difference. \r\n\r\nYou will see the presence of Cylance anti-virus on this machine. Cylance is not present on one of the other three tested machines, and is not the cause."
