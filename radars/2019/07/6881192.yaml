    description: "How to Reproduce:\r\nYou can reproduce these inconsistencies by loading the below link into `openURL` with universal link only option, and reproduce the redirect to itmss: by loading it in WKWebView.\r\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/podcast-me-anything/id1454336984?fbclid=IwAR0v2-g1cm03vJmBqAk9TjewcUNCUcdle8fDM-voVL7D2asB71NSQPtOerA\r\n\r\nDescription of Issue:\r\nIn WKWebView (via `loadRequest` or on link click) opens the following link in iTunes Store App:\r\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/podcast-me-anything/id1454336984?fbclid=IwAR0v2-g1cm03vJmBqAk9TjewcUNCUcdle8fDM-voVL7D2asB71NSQPtOerA\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an apple-app-site-association file specifying this should open in Podcasts app here:\r\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association\r\n\r\nAlong with this, we found that opening this link with `openURL` with option `UIApplicationOpenURLOptionUniversalLinksOnly` fails, \r\nwhich according to available info means that a universal link was not available for the supplied URL, contradicting what we see in the apple-app-site-association pointed out above.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is also seen for `maps` https universal links, however, I could not find the app-site-association file for it.\r\nhttps://maps.apple.com/?q=222%202nd%20St%20San%20Francisco%20CA\r\n\r\nCalling `openURL` without the option for `podcast.apple.com` link mentioned, opens the podcasts app, the correct destination app.\r\nCalling `openURL` without the option for `maps.apple.com` link mentioned, opens the maps app, the correct destination app.\r\n\r\nOpening in wkwebview, it attempts to open as a normal page, however, it then triggers a 301 redirect (see charles file attached),\r\nredirecting to a url, with an itunes store deeplink scheme (itmss:) and the same path (full path below). \r\nOur custom wkwebview deeplink code, then handles this with openURL into iTunes Store app.\r\nitmss://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/podcast-me-anything/id1454336984?fbclid=IwAR0v2-g1cm03vJmBqAk9TjewcUNCUcdle8fDM-voVL7D2asB71NSQPtOerA\r\n\r\nThe inconsistencies we see when this link is opened differs between iOS App Store apps:\r\n- Chrome, WeChat, LinkedIn open the link in iTunes Store App.\r\n- Safari & SFSafariViewController, FB Messenger, Messages, Mail open link in Podcasts app.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be similar to an open radar bug reported a year ago here: \r\nhttps://openradar.appspot.com/39347603"
