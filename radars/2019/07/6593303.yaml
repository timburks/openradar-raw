    description: "With the new build system (introduced in Xcode 10), if, after a successful build, you change a C++ header file contents - Xcode will not detect the change and will not perform the required compilation.\r\n\r\nAlready mentioned in the Apple developers forum:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/109826\r\n\r\nI've noticed it might be related to the way I've included the header:\r\n\"Sample/WCRedisClient.h\"\r\n\r\nIf you change it to:\r\n\"../WCRedisClient.h\"\r\n\r\n...the described behavior may not happen.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to use the legacy build system, however this is good until it will be deprecated altogether.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nIn the attached project, perform an initial successful build (cmd+B), then write some garbage into the .h file and hit cmd+B again. \r\nResult: no error.\r\nSwitch to the legacy build system and the error is detected as expected.\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nExpected a compilation error after changing the header file contents.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nCompiler didn't detect the change in the header file and didn't recompile the cpp."
