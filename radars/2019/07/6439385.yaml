    description: "In iOS 13, the share sheet is no longer dismissed when the user selects Mail or Messages and then dismisses the compose window. However, the UIActivityViewController .completionWithItemsHandler is called already when the compose window is dismissed - not when the activity view controller is dismissed. When the user subsequently successfully shares the item with any service or dismisses the activity view controller, the completionWithItemsHandler is not called again.\r\n\r\nI would expect that completionWithItemsHandler is called only once, when the activity view controller is dismissed (with or without sharing the item). However, it should not be called for dismissals of child view controllers such as the mail or message compose view controller."
