    description: "- On a ViewController with a UITextField\r\n- Call textField.becomeFirstResponder() in viewWillAppear or viewDidLoad\r\n- Tap some text in the field\r\n- If you try to edit the field, either with the longPress on spaceBar or on the field, you can't move the cursor in the middle of the field, it always come back to the begining of the text\r\n- Workaround : Dispatch the call to becomeFirstResponder ( DispatchQueue.main.async {  self.field.becomeFirstResponder() }\r\n\r\nThis is happening since ios 13.0 and still there in 13.2"
