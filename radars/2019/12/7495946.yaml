    description: "Currently, App Store Connect only offers the option to localize the app separately for Spanish (Mexico) and Spanish (Spain). That’s way too broad considering there are 9 countries in Latin America alone that have Spanish as their primary language.\r\n\r\nWe encountered the need to submit different screenshots and metadata for those countries since our app has different features depending on which country you’re using it at.\r\n\r\nPlease expand the list of countries to include all countries in Latin America instead of just grouping everything under “Mexico”."
