    description: "Setting the object for 'kSecAttrAccessControl' key makes impossible to read the saved value from KeyChain on a Simulator (only) with -25300 OSStatus.\r\nTo reproduce the issue - just build and run the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nYou can always read saved previously value on iOS 12, but if you have set object for 'kSecAttrAccessControl' key - you won't be able to read it on iOS 13 Simulator.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for iOS 13.* Simulator is just to comment out the line number 128 in 'KeychainHelper.m' file:\r\n/* Comment out the line below to fix the issue for Simulator iOS 13 */\r\n    [itemDict setObject:(__bridge id)sacObject forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrAccessControl];\r\n/* Comment out the line above to fix the issue for Simulator iOS 13 */\r\n\r\n*Note:* the issue isn't reproducible on Real devices (any iOS version) and iOS Simulators prior to iOS 13.0."
