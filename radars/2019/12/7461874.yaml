    description: "Updated:\r\nSince my last update we have been able to recreate this issue with 2 different devices, 2 different OS's, and 2 different sets of AirPods.\r\n\r\nThe key problem is what triggers the connection to the AirPods. If you are connected to your Mac, then connect to your phone, your CLBeaconRegion monitoring events are broken. We are still trying to find the correct path to correct the issue, but so far it has taken a lot of rebooting and re-monitoring to get accurate updates to occur after triggering this issue.\r\n\r\nThe new corrected steps for recreation are:\r\n\r\n1.  Monitor a Beacon region with your phone. Ensure you can trigger entry and exit events reliably.\r\n2. Connect your AirPods Pro or Wireless Charging Case AirPods to your Mac. We tested with latest generation MacBook Pro 13\" and 15\".\r\n3. Use your phone to take connection of the AirPods\r\n4. Trigger a Beacon entry or exit event and notice that it will not trigger any more.\r\n\r\nWe tested this back in iOS 13.2.2 and the latest version 13.2.3 and it is the same for both.\r\n\r\nOriginal Description:\r\nWe are still in the process of testing this issue and documenting all of the steps to recreate. We are finding we get different unexpected results at different times. Something is clearly broken.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to roughly recreate the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Monitor a CLBeaconRegion, we are using our own Simple In/Out app that monitors Beacons.\r\n2. Connect AirPods Pro and play music. Test device is iPhone Xs running iOS 13.2.2 and using Apple Music.\r\n3. Exit range of the region.\r\n\r\nThe exit event was not occurring and all other Beacon events stop working. CLCircularRegion events still continue to work if enabled.\r\n\r\nWe have been experimenting with other Bluetooth devices. So far, AirPods with Wireless Charging case and Wireless Bose NC 700. We are seeing odd behavior when connecting to a new device, you will get exit events triggered for any region that the device can see. We have 2 in our office and exit events fire for both on a Bluetooth connection. We are still trying to isolate the exact behavior, but there are a lot of erratic updates firing when connecting to Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nThis could be device specific as well. We have tried to recreate on an iPhone 11 Pro running 13.2.2 with the same wireless headphones and it has not been an issue. We are not sure what else to look for or try. We need to know if this is a software problem on our end (which we don't think it is) or if there is a hardware bug some users may need to look out for.\r\n\r\nWe will update this with additional recreating steps as we discover more."
