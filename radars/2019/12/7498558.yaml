    description: "I enjoyed watching the demos of the ChocolateChip app used in WWDC 2019 sessions 205 and 235, I was wondering if it would be possible for that project to be made available on the session video page as I would like to browse the whole project including the source files not shown in the videos and the storyboard.\r\n\r\nBelow are the pages that the sample project could be added to:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/205/\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/235/\r\n\r\nMaybe Jason Beaver (in 205), Jamie Montgomorie or Glen Low (both from 235) could help?\r\n\r\nI also posted this question about this on the dev forum which includes what I wanted to learn from the sample code:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/127142"
