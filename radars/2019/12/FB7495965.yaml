    description: "Currently, in the App Store Connect interface, it is only possible to translate the store text and assets between Spanish (Spain), and Spanish(México), being \"México\" used as latin Spanish.\r\n\r\nI believe that it would be better to rename the \"Spanish (México)\" option to \"Spanish (Latin América)\", to match the iOS/macOS system language distribution.\r\n\r\nAnd, most importantly, it is necessary to have more Spanish options, like: \"Spanish (Peru)\", \"Spanish (Venezuela)\", etc.\r\n\r\nThe Latin American market is quite different from one another, and having the option to adapt the texts, and images is a big deal. So, it would be important to have a more granular options of internationalisation."
