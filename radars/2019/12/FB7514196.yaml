    description: "CarPlay simulator not functioning on Xcode 11.3, methods from MPPlayableContentDataSource and MPPlayableContentDelegate never fire.\r\n\r\nTake an app with complete CarPlay support (entitlements, MPPlayableContentDataSource and MPPlayableContentDelegate conformance...) that is fully functional on the actual device when connected to a car stereo with CarPlay support.\r\n\r\nLaunch it on the iOS13 simulator.\r\n\r\nSelect the menu of Simulator app: Hardware > External displays > CarPlay\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nA fully functional CarPlay simulator. \r\nI expect (would like) not to spend days debugging my app inside my car or at a car dealer.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n\r\nA window with the CarPlay simulator appears with the title of the app and a spinner\r\n\r\nAfter a while a prompt appears: Unable to connect to \"App Name\".\r\n\r\nA \"Try Again\" button is also displayed. Clicking on the button doesn't resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nMethods from MPPlayableContentDataSource and MPPlayableContentDelegate are never called. (but they are when run on the actual device connected to a CarPlay system)."
