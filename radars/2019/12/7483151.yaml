    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\n10.15 macOS SDK introduced crash when changing NSWindow styleMask between titled and borderless windows\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nAppKit\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nApplication Crash\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nWhen I began distributing my app using the 10.15 SDK (with Xcode 11.2.1) I started getting a lot of crash reports like the one attached. Previously, I had released binaries built with Xcode 10.3 on the 10.14 SDK, and the crash never occurred. Based on my investigation, NSScrollView is key-value observing contentLayoutGuide.frame on NSWindow and -setStyleMask modifies the window’s _borderView ivar in a non-KVO compliant way just before causing NSScrollView to remove its observer, causing the assertion. This is a problem because -[NSWindow contentLayoutGuide]’s return value depends on whether its _borderView ivar responds to -contentLayoutGuide.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when setStyleMask: changes the NSWindowStyleMaskTitled flag, as that changes the _borderView between NSNextStepFrame and NSThemeFrame.\r\n\r\nI believe this is an SDK bug because I don't directly add such a key-value observer. \r\n\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce the bug locally yet, so I can't tell under what conditions the contentLayoutGuide.frame gets observed."
