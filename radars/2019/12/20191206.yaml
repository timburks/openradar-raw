    description: "The device, a last-generation Airport Express access-point, is running the latest firmware; static IPV4 address; Wireless on in Bridge mode (the perimeter router does the DHCP); one wireless client. \r\nIt's down-stream from a Cisco 2960G managed gigabit ethernet switch.\r\nEvery few days the Airport Express generates a storm of either broadcast or unicast or multicast packets that saturates the gigabit bandwidth of the 2960G switch's ethernet port for a second or more, sending the port into ErrDisable state which shuts down the port until reset.\r\n(The reset is done by sending commands to the switch's console port, or enabling an auto reset feature in the switch)\r\nIs this problem unique to my unit? \r\nIs it a software/firmware bug? \r\nIs it a hardware feature/issue/bug?"
