    description: "Area:\r\nNetworking\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOur corporate client requires all HTTP and HTTPS traffic on their local network to go through authenticated HTTP proxy. In 10.14 Mojave App Store and softwareupdate does not work when authenticated HTTP proxy is set in System Preferences -> Network.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Erase disk and install clean macOS 10.14.1 Mojave.\r\n2. Connect Mac to the network where all HTTP(S) traffic must go through authenticated Proxy\r\n3. Configure both Web Proxy and Secure Web Proxy with server, port, user and password in System Preferences -> Network -> <interface> -> Advanced -> Proxies\r\n4. Grant accss to keychaing items with by always allow in anoying keychaing prompts or in keychain access.app itself for all applications (radar://46273649).\r\n5. Open Safari and verify web pages works.\r\n6. Run softwareupdate -l in Terminal.app or open Software Update in System Preferences and have it check of updates. Open App Store.app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp Store and softwareupdate works with authenticated proxy. All http requests go through proxy in proxy authenticated http session.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsoftwareupdate -l in Terminal says NSURLErrorDomain error -1012\r\nApp Store displays connection error.\r\n\r\nWe checked the proxy logs and foud out macOS is trying to access resources from oscp.digicert.com without proxy authentication. When we configured proxy not to require authentication for request going from our test machine to oscp.digicert.com/*  both softwareudpate and App Store worked.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14.1/18B75\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nBoth softwareupdate nad App Store work with authenticated proxy in 10.13.6 17G65 and 17G3025. This was proably broken with changes in 10.14 Mojave where you did something new with EV certs.\r\n\r\nSysdiagnose from test computer with 10.14.1.\r\nScreenshot with user facing this situation."
