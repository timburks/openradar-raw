    description: "Invert Colors is an accessibility feature, and Smart Invert is a mode for that feature that is intended to preserve media (images) while inverting other display colors.\r\n\r\nWkWebView ignores this mode, and worse also ignores requests to explicitly disable inverted colours. The end result is that all content, including images and other media, always ends up inverted."
