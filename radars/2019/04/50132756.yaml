    description: "Summary:\r\nWe can't rely on StoreKit payment queue to deliver unfinished transactions to handle interrupted purchase scenarios on the mac (as described in \r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/DeliverProduct.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267-CH5-SW4). Note that everything seems fine on iOS in this regard.\r\n\r\nDate and time when issue occurred: 23.04.2019 18:26:00 +0300\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a breakpoint in transaction queue observer’s paymentQueue:updatedTransactions: method right before processing and finishing the transaction.\r\n2. Initiate a purchase and confirm it via series of system popups.\r\n3. Once the app reaches the breakpoint, return immediately using \"thread return\" command in LLDB.\r\n4. Terminate and relaunch your app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStoreKit calls the paymentQueue:updatedTransactions: method again shortly after launch with unfinished transaction with state == SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnfinished transaction never comes to transaction queue observer’s paymentQueue:updatedTransactions: method (at least immediately after next launch).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nPurchases were tested in sandbox environment.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac15,1 macOS 10.14.4 (18E226)\r\nXcode Version 10.2.1 (10E1001)"
