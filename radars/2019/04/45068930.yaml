    description: "Summary:\r\nAVSampleBufferAudioRenderer fails to play non-interleaved, multi-channel, uncompressed audio. Interleaved or mono audio succeeds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have attached a sample project that exhibits the issue. The sample project uses Extended Audio File Services to decompress an MP4 audio file and then sends the audio samples to AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer.\r\n\r\nThe top of my AudioPlayer class has two configurable constants: `isInterleaved` and `channelCount`. You can play with those to verify that what I said in the above Summary section is true.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAVSampleBufferAudioRenderer should be able to successfully play non-interleaved, multi-channel, uncompressed audio.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAVSampleBufferAudioRenderer fails to play non-interleaved, multi-channel, uncompressed audio. There is a repeated log message that is relevant: `[AQ] 405: SSP::Render: CopySlice returned 1`.\r\n\r\nAccording to my reverse engineering (https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/108558), the error is generated because `CopySlice` is trying to copy a multi-buffer source `AudioBufferList` into a single-buffer destination `AudioBufferList`. Why I donâ€™t know, but hopefully that helps narrow down the issue."
