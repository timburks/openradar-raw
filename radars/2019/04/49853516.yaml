    description: "Summary:\r\nThe first time you launch the iOS simulator, the \"Automatically sync pasteboard\" option in the \"Edit\" menu does not work. In order to make it work you have to turn it off and then on again once.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch iOS Simulator (e.g. from Xcode + with \"Automatically sync pasteboard\" selected\")\r\n2. Copy text in macOS\r\n3. Try to paste in a text field (etc) in the iOS Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShows \"paste\" in a tooltip popup and you can paste the copied text in\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDoes not detect that you have copied text. Need to turn off and on the \"Automatically sync\" option in the \"Edit\" menu and then copy the text again and then go to paste it in the simulator again. If you close the simulator completely and try again, same result.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 10.2 (10E125), Simulator Version 10.2 (SimulatorApp-880.5 CoreSimulator-587.35)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.14.4 (18E226), MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)"
