    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary: UIWebView supports being able to modify headers on outgoing requests, whereas WKWebView does not. It is possible to achieve a partial solution by overriding `webView(_ webView: WKWebView, decidePolicyFor navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, decisionHandler: @escaping (WKNavigationActionPolicy) -> ())` in `WKNavigationDelegate`, however this does not cover XMLHttpRequest (XHR) requests, which are very important in single page applications.\r\n\r\nThis significantly limits the usefulness of WKWebView for some applications. This is a downgrade from UIWebView for this use case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n- Attempt to apply headers to any outgoing request, for example \"x-secret-key\": \"1234\"\r\n- Use a web application with XHR requests\r\n- Notice your header is not being applied\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Header should be applied to all requests.\r\n\r\nActual Results: webView(_ webView: WKWebView, decidePolicyFor navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, decisionHandler: @escaping (WKNavigationActionPolicy) -> ()) is not invoked for non-XHR requests. This means headers cannot be applied to XHR requests.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Any up to and including iOS 12.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Nothing non-standard"
