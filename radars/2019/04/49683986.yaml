    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nNormally when navigating from a viewController that doesn't support largeTitles to one that does the navigation bar will animate its resizing. If this navigation is done by calling `popToRootViewController(animated:)` this animation will not occur and the bar will snap down.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Check out the sample project attached.\r\n(This project is simply three view controllers that get pushed onto the navigation stack then the final one can pop off)\r\n2. Run it in a simulator\r\n3. Hit \"Push\"\r\n4. Hit \"Push\" again\r\n5. Hit \"Pop to Root\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe navigation bar should animate to its new larger size\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe navigation bar snaps to its larger size\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12.1 + Xcode 10.1 at least\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAppears to happen on all phones/iPads"
