    description: "Version 12.1 includes a new auto-submit behavior when autofilling passwords on the Mac. I’m sure this behavior is desirable by certain people, but it has significantly disrupted my workflow. \r\n\r\nMany times when logging in to a website there are extra fields that need to be filled in other than the username and password, checkboxes that need to be checked, or captchas that need to be answered. In those cases, the auto-submission of the filled username and password ends up causing a login failure which makes it so the feature becomes basically unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\nTry to use password auto-fill on a login form that has other options or fields, such as a “keep me logged in” checkbox or a captcha.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\nAutofill should either be smart enough to notice that and not auto-submit, or there should be an option to disable the auto-submission behavior.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\r\nAutofill will submit the form automatically, causing issues in situations where there are extra fields, checkboxes or a captcha."
