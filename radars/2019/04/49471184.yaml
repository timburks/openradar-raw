    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n- Core Bluetooth does not provide a way to detect connection events from `CBCentral`s when running in peripheral-role via `CBPeripheralManager`.\r\n- Core Bluetooth does it provide a way to refuse connections (to implement BLE broadcast role).\r\n- Core Bluetooth does not provide a way to generate custom advertisement data frames.\r\n- Core Bluetooth does not seem to give direct access to the advertising device's UUID via its `CBPeripheralManager`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAlways.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n`CBPeripheralManager` is usable far beyond use for trivial peripherals.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n`CBPeripheralManager` is barely usable beyond use for trivial peripherals.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 6.0 or later"
