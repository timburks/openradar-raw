    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe documentation states:\r\n\r\n> After advertising your app as a beacon, your app must continue running in the foreground to broadcast the needed Bluetooth signals. If the user quits the app, the system stops advertising the device as a peripheral over Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nThis is really limiting.\r\n\r\nOne would assume that such a limitation was introduced to reduce battery use while in background. But given that with the `bluetooth-peripheral` `UIBackgroundMode` one can already do broadcasting in the background, this doesn't seem to be the driving factor. Same goes for privacy. One could already use advertisements for device tracking, just not as conveniently as with iBeacons.\r\n\r\nI would thus like to kindly ask to add support for beaconing in the background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPass advertisement data from `CLBeaconRegion` to Core Bluetooth's `startAdvertising(_:)` function and switch to background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\niOS keeps broadcasting iBeacon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\niOS stops broadcasting iBeacon.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 7.0, or later\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
