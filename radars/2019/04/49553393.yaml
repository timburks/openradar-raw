    description: "Area:\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nApple is known for prioritizing consistency and quality. You have a very well written and comprehensive Human Interface Guidelines that you expect third-party developers to follow. However, Finder and many of Apple's apps do not properly follow these guidelines, setting a bad example for third-party developers, and weakening your reputation of caring about quality.\r\n\r\nRead through https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/app-architecture/preferences/\r\n\r\nI have compiled a list of apps that don't follow the HIG and what they need to fix:\r\n\r\n- Finder.app shows \"Finder Preferences\" as the window title for all the panes.\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> Update the window's title to reflect the currently visible preference pane.\r\n- Messages.app has the minimize button enabled.\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> Disable the Minimize and Zoom buttons.\r\n- Mail.app has the minimize button enabled.\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> Disable the Minimize and Zoom buttons.\r\n- iTunes.app doesn't apply the changes immediately.\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> Apply preference changes immediately.\r\n- Dictionary.app has the zoom button enabled.\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> Disable the Minimize and Zoom buttons.\r\n- Books.app uses the tab title and the word \"Preferences\" as the window title, for example, \"General Preferences\".\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> For example, if your preferences window has a General preference pane, the window’s title should be General when that pane is active.\r\n- TextEdit.app uses the window title \"Preferences\".\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> If your window doesn’t have multiple preference panes, then its title should be App Name Preferences.\r\n- FaceTime.app uses the window title \"Preferences\".\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> If your window doesn’t have multiple preference panes, then its title should be App Name Preferences.\r\n- Keychain Access.app uses the window title \"Preferences\".\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> If your window doesn’t have multiple preference panes, then its title should be App Name Preferences.\r\n- Script Editor.app has the minimize button enabled.\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> Disable the Minimize and Zoom buttons.\r\n- Audio MIDI Setup.app has the minimize and zoom button enabled.\r\n\tWhich is a violation of:\r\n\t> Disable the Minimize and Zoom buttons.\r\n\r\nThis could have been all solved if Apple provided an official Preferences window controller that worked exactly like the Human Interface Guidelines describes. Lots of third-party apps also get it wrong when implementing a Preferences window.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen one of the mentions apps and click \"Preferences…\" in the app menu.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected the Preferences window to follow the HIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe window does not follow the HIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
