    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf app is launched when status bar is present, the launch screen image will be cut off in the middle to make room for status bar (screenshots attached). As soon as message in status bar appears (ex. Personal Hotspot: 1 Connection) the image is correct. Workaround is to suppress appearance of status bar by setting UIStatusBarHidden property to true.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Turn on Hotspot.\r\n- Connect at least one device to that hotspot.\r\n- Start the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Launch screen image is displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Launch screen image missing central part.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.2"
