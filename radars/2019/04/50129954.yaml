    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's no reliable and documented way now to verify that subscription offer was redeemed successfully or not. Transaction observer receives failed transaction with vague error on iOS / nil on macOS in case, if user is currently subscribed to subscription plan with same product ID.\r\n\r\nDate and time when issue occurred: 23.04.2019 17:24:03 +0300\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Purchase subscription with product ID == X.\r\n2. Transaction observer receives transaction with state == SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased.\r\n3. While subscription is active, prepare SKPaymentDiscount, add it to SKPayment and initiate a purchase of the product with same product ID == X.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTransaction observer either:\r\na) receives transaction with state SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased or \r\nb) receives transaction with state SKPaymentTransactionStateFailed and an error clearly indicating that the offer was redeemed successfully.\r\nAlso transaction.payment.paymentDiscount should not be nil.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTransaction observer receives transaction with state == SKPaymentTransactionStateFailed with error == nil and transaction.payment.paymentDiscount == nil.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nPurchases were tested in sandbox environment.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac15,1 macOS 10.14.4 (18E226)\r\nXcode Version 10.2.1 (10E1001)"
