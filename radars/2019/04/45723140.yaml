    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen having a Multi-selection active via the shortcuts provided with Xcode 10, invoking the Toggle Commands function doesn't work as expected. Instead of commenting/uncommenting the selected lines, it throws the whole block as commented by expanding the selection to the whole single block at the same time.\r\n\r\nSee the attached videos from both Xcode and Sublime Text.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Mojave @ Mac mini 2012"
