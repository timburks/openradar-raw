    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting UITextView's `text` property does not usually invoke the delegate method `textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementText:)`.\r\n\r\nThis does not appear to be true if the user taps a suggestion on the predictive keyboard. In that case, the delegate method is called twice.\r\n\r\nInvocation 1:\r\n    Invoked in response to the change in the text view. This is expected and is the same behaviour as typing on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nInvocation 2:\r\n    Invoked as part of the `text` setter. This is unwanted behaviour as we intercept replacement text via `textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementText:)`and set the text property manually. This is currently causing predictive words to appear twice.\r\n\r\nThe docs state \"The text view calls this method whenever the user types a new character or deletes an existing character.\" which leads me to believe the second invocation is unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Intercept replacement text in `textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementText:)` and set the text view's `text` property manually before returning `false`.\r\n\r\n2. Tap a word on the predictive toolbar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementText:)` invoked once in response to the tap on the predictive toolbar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementText:)` invoked a second time, on setting the `text` property."
