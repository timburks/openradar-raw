    description: "Do not disturb is used for (at least) two scenarios:\r\n1. I don't want to be distracted, or distract people around me.\r\n2. I'm out of the office, resting, just browsing before going to sleep.\r\n\r\nBadges are anxiety inducers for many people, and will be shown and updated (!) even when “Do not disturb” is on.\r\n\r\nI suggest adding an option (maybe via force touch) to hide all badges in apps, while in \"Do not disturb\". That way, you consume what you want and no app with try to call your attention (via notifications or badges)."
