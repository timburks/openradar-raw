    description: "When a shortcut with a custom intent is used in the Shortcuts app and the shortcut fails, the Shortcuts app shows an alert saying that \"An unknown error occurred\" as shown on the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nInstead of shown a generic and non-descriptive error message, I suggest that the Shortcuts app shows the failure message returned by the intent handler in as part of the intent response. These errors are defined by the developer and are very likely to be much more descriptive than \"An unknown error occured\" and can help the user to resolve the error."
