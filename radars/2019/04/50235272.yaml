    description: "Summary:\r\nPure black should show as (0, 0, 0). It does so when playing a 10-bit video in QuickTime Player. However, when playing an 8-bit video, it shows as (1, 0, 1) instead. This is especially noticeable on an OLED TV.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have attached an 8-bit video and a 10-bit video both created by Final Cut Pro.\r\n\r\n1. Change the display color profile in System Preferences to “HD 709-A”.\r\n2. Open the 8-bit video in QuickTime Player.\r\n3. Open Digital Color Meter and use “Display native values” mode to measure the output color.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe color should be (0, 0, 0).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe color is (1, 0, 1) for the 8-bit video."
