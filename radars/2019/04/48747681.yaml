    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the `_iosConnectInitalize` IOSurface internal function, the string→integer mapping for the Y′CbCr matrix is missing an entry for `ITU_R_2020→9`. (There are no other missing entries.)\r\n\r\nThis means an IOSurface-backed `CVPixelBuffer` that contains Rec. 2020 colors will be rendered by the macOS rendering pipeline using an incorrect Y′CbCr→RGB conversion matrix because the backing `IOSurface` will have a matrix code point of `0` instead of `9`.\r\n\r\n(Also, the function name, `_iosConnectInitalize`, has a typo… should be `Initialize`…)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe attached video file was created using Final Cut Pro. It has three colors, one every second: sRGB (255, 0, 0), sRGB (0, 255, 0), sRGB (0, 0, 255). The color space of the video is Rec. 2020.\r\n\r\nView the attached video file in QuickTime Player.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsing Digital Color Meter with the “Display in sRGB” option selected, we should see (255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), and (0, 0, 255) (or close to it due to computer math imprecision).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsing Digital Color Meter with the “Display in sRGB” option selected, I see (252, 0, 24), (0, 255, 36), (31, 0, 247)."
