    description: "Area:\r\nFaceTime\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe experience of accepting a FaceTime call while listening to other audio, especially when using a non-default audio output device, seems to be quite buggy and has some unfortunate choices which make the process worse.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Listen to music on AirPods.\r\n2. Receive a standard phone call.\r\n3. Pick up the call.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe music pauses, the call starts on AirPods and when I end the call the music unpauses and continues on my AirPods.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGenerally, the only thing that works is that incoming calls pause audio. Actually trying to pick up the call often results in the call hanging (while my other devices, such as my iPhone and Apple Watch, continue ringing) and then eventual call failure. Audio output will seemingly \"invert\" itself so that it will start coming out of my computer's speakers unless I select the internal speakers as the output source. Once the call stops the audio goes back to normal, which in this case means it blares out of my computer's speakers again because I've set it to do that so audio comes out of my AirPods during the call. Pressing the pause button to stop the music on my keyboard will automatically accept repeat calls (which are common due to call failures).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 5.0 (3080)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS Mojave 10.14.5 Beta (18F108f)"
