    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen streaming Apple Music songs via MPMusicPlayerController.applicationXPlayer, and the user backgrounds the app, there is no way to display music info or controls on the lock-screen.\r\n\r\nPrior to iOS 12, this info was populated automatically, although it was difficult to infer that a control-event had happened. This no longer occurs beginning with iOS 12 (I think that's when it started), and in fact the streaming audio no longer keeps our app alive when backgrounded (it is suspended immediately, as if the music playback belongs to a different process).\r\n\r\nWhen streaming music through an AVAudioSession that our app controls, we can manually configure the MPNowPlayingInfoCenter and MPRemoteCommandCenter. This would be ideal, but has never been possible when using MPMusicPlayerController.applicationXPlayer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Run the example project on a physical device (not a simulator) with a valid Apple Music subscription.\r\n\r\n2) Open the app & verify that \"Jitterbug\" begins playing.\r\n\r\n3) Lock the phone\r\n\r\n4 Awake the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe music info & playback controls should be present on the lock-screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no music info or lock-screen controls (and, the app is suspended, but that's difficult to verify in this example project).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n1.0/1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany"
