    description: "On iOS 12.2 the simulated touchpad area does not reliably scrub thru the video. It may scrub at first but does not continue to scrub after the first 4 or 5 swipes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nStart playing video on Apple TV. Bring up the iOS remote. Try to scrub by tapping in the simulated touchpad area and then swiping horizontally.  It may scrub thru video at first. But the scrubbing stops working.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect scrubbing to consistently happen. Instead it only happens initially then stops working. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nScrubbing and pausing by tapping in the simulated touchpad area fails to have any effects. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration"
