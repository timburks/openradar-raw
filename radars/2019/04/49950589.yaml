    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `hasFocus` `XCUIElementAttribute` is only available on tvOS, but it is not marked as such in the Xcode documentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen [the documentation page for `hasFocus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1627636-hasfocus), and note no mention of OS compatibility.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to see a note somewhere saying that the `hasFocus` attribute is only available on tvOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo note is present saying that the `hasFocus` attribute is only available on tvOS.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.2 (10E125)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI was able to deduce that `hasFocus` is only available on tvOS be looking at the `XCUIElementAttributes.h` file, where on line 69 we have:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n#if TARGET_OS_TV\r\n/*! Whether or not the elment has UI focus. */\r\n@property (readonly) BOOL hasFocus;\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother (better) solution to this issue would be to make the `hasFocus` attribute available on other OS’s, particularly macOS. I’ll also be filing an enhancement ticket in Developer Tools asking for that."
