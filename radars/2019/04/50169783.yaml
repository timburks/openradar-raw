    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UIBarButtonItem's isEnabled property is false, tapping it does nothing. But if a user has their text size set to a large accessibility size there is some additional functionality. If the user taps and holds on the button, a HUD appears showing the button's title in large text in the center of the screen. After doing this, if the user releases their finger, the button's action method will be called.\r\n\r\nThis is a big issue for apps that have workflows with input validation that rely on their UIBarButtonItems to be disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the Settings app, under General > Accessibility > Larger Text\r\n2. Switch \"Larger Accessibility Sizes\" on, and adjust the text size preference to the largest setting.\r\n3. Launch an app that has a UIBarButtonItem with its \"isEnabled\" property set to false.\r\n4. Press and hold the button until the assistive interface HUD appears, displaying the button's title.\r\n5. Release the press.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe HUD disappears and nothing else happens.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe HUD disappears and the button's action is called.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.2"
