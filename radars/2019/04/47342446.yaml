    description: "Core Text draws the stroke after the fill. Since half of the stroke is on the inside and half of the stroke is on the outside, this results in the fill getting smaller as the stroke gets bigger.\r\n\r\nI would say this is not the ideal default behavior; most people would expect only the outside of the text to be stroked. Please make this the default behavior or at least provide an option. Thanks!"
