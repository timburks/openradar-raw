    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running the Upgrade integration from Xcode Server 9.3 to 9.4, all integrations fail. The reason given is that the Simulators specified for running the tests are no longer connected:\r\n\r\nBuild Service Error: Devices configured for testing are not connected: iPad Pro (9.7-inch) (iOS 11.3), iPhone 7 (iOS 11.3).\r\n\r\nWhich seems obvious, because the new Xcode has the iOS 11.4 SDK and Simulators\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an integration bot in Xcode 9.3 that targets iOS 11.3 Simulators\r\n2. Update Xcode to 9.4 to trigger the Upgrade integration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither of\r\nA) Integrations are automatically updated to the latest Simulators (in this case 11.4)\r\nB) The old 11.3 Simulators arenâ€™t disconnected / deleted\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIntegrations fail because the iOS 11.3 Simulators are no longer available\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3 / 9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
