    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode 10.2 was incorrectly indenting my Objective-C code.\r\n\r\nVideo: https://www.useloom.com/share/9b7bf0ad85b247e6a5649484e2ae1133\r\n\r\nI thought it was a new feature, but then my students were not seeing the same behavior. I couldn't find an option to change indentation, and my settings matched my students settings for indentation.\r\n\r\n#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>\r\n\r\n@interface ViewController : UIViewController\r\n    \r\n    @property NSString *dogsName;\r\n    \r\n    @property NSString *name;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @end\r\n\r\nUsing the indentation setting incorrectly adjust indentation of the file (@end is indented).\r\n\r\nNOTE: Closing/opening Xcode fixes the issue, but it's still an issue that should be fixed. I haven't been able to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Create new Objective-C iOS/Mac app\r\n3. Try to write code below a @interface or @implementation block\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Xcode should not indent my Objective-C code ... all code should be top level unless a function/method/loop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAll my properties, function names are indented as if I was writing logic inside a Swift class, but I'm using Objective-C.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 10.2 \r\n\r\nConfiguration: MacBook Pro 15\" 2018"
