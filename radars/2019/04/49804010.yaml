    description: "Summary:\r\nWe were instructed by DTS to file a bug report. The TSI reference number is [REDACTED].\r\n\r\nOur remote management app, Royal TSX (https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/mac) uses a CAMetalLayer by default for rendering RDP connections.\r\nSince the 10.14.4 update rolled out officially, we've been getting a lot of crash reports from users which point to an issue with our Metal renderer or Apple's implementation of Metal.\r\n\r\nWe appended multiple crash logs to the bug report.\r\n\r\nWe looked through the code and couldn't identify any issues. Also, there have been no such reports before 10.14.4 rolled out. Unfortunately we haven't yet been able to reproduce the crashes here on any of our machines. What we gathered from searching the net for this is that it might be related to automatic graphics switching which we unfortunately can't test as we don't have access to a machine with multiple graphics cards that's also Metal capable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since we follow the development of Microsoft's Remote Desktop app closely, we recently noticed that an update was released which mentions that they've been working with Apple on resolving an instability issue related to graphics in 10.14.4. It very much sounds like they ran into the very same issue as us.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, we can provide the source code of our Metal renderer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown at the moment but from user's crash reports it looks like it's related to automatic graphic switching. Users reported that the crash happened when returning from the screen saver, after switching to the login screen and logging back in, after returning their Mac from sleep and after switching between apps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDon't crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashes.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14.4 (18E226)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHaven't been able to reproduce this on an iMac Pro and a 2016 MacBook Pro 13\"."
