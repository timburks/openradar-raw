    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI, and many other developers, like to build projects without any warnings: it's a good way to keep you honest.\r\n\r\nSometimes you do something that's a little out of the ordinary and have to resort to #pragma clang diagnostic to silence the warning. In my mind, this explicit action is fine - I'm taking control of the issue away from the compiler. It's my code and my responsibility.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not possible with a Storyboard or Nib that's managed by Xcode. There's no way to say \"this is fine.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe it's with Auto Layout Localization on some text you know won't be localized or has a fixed width in all languages (Emoji, for example).\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a frame for a table view cell that's wrong in its container but will be right when that container is embedded in another container.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's when you don't assign a content view controller to your window controller in the storyboard, but it's the first thing you do in the runtime logic.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason, there's no way to suppress these warnings and they break the \"no warnings\" rule we set for ourselves.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDo one of the things mentioned above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou'd have a way to suppress the warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou have no way to suppress the warnings.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nVersion 10.2 (10E125)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A"
