    description: "Hi! I'm having issues localizing siri custom templated responses to Portuguese. It used to work a while ago, we only noticed it happening a few weeks ago. Instead of speaking our custom response, a generic \"OK, veja s√≥\" message is spoken instead.\r\n\r\nCustom failure messages work correctly, and custom success messages in other localizations such as English or German work correctly.\r\n\r\nAnyone can confirm this bug? I created rdar://49517251 and TSI ticket which was dismissed as the bugreport is still under investigation (or limbo?)\r\n\r\nWe are close to releasing our first version including Siri Shortcuts, and not having custom responses in our native locale is a dealbreaker! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe tested in both Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 10.2 and several devices running iOS 12.1 / iOS 12.1.4 / iOS 12.2\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nRafael"
