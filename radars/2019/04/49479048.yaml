    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen a form input element receives focus, the page scrolls erratically, and the input does not remain in view. It is either hidden behind the keyboard, or behind the to/from/subject block. Recipients are required to scroll in order to locate and confirm the input element, prior to entering information.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Send HTML email that contains form input elements (It's important to ensure the act of sending does not manipulate the markup)\r\n3. Open email in native iOS mail client\r\n3. Tap into a form input field\r\n> Test HTML: https://gist.github.com/theotherstevenc/c027a303406fe0b39e515ba4b55aedc0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe input field should be positioned so that it is not obstructed from view after receiving focus, without unnecessary page movement. Ideally, the input should be centered horizontally between the keyboard app navigation. (Last known to work as expected in iOS 9) \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDepending on the location of the input relative to the viewport, once the input receives focus, and after the email content shifts erratically, the input is either hidden behind the keyboard, or behind the to/from/subject block. Rarely does it remain in view. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1.4 (16D57) \r\niOS 12.2  (16E227)\r\nOriginally noticed and reported with the release of iOS 10\r\n10.0.1 [14A403]; 10.0.1 [14A403]\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7"
