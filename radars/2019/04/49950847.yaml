    description: "Duplicate of 22163138\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe `hasFocus` `XCUIElementAttribute` is only available on tvOS. This would be very handy to have access too on other OS's, particularly on macOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhen running an XCUITest against a macOS app, attempt to access the `hasFocus` property on an XCUIElement. Note that it is not accessible, but other properties such as `isEnabled` are accessible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to be able to access the `hasFocus` property on an XCUIElement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to access the `hasFocus` property on the XCUIElement.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.2 (10E125)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI was able to deduce that `hasFocus` is only available on tvOS be looking at the `XCUIElementAttributes.h` file, where on line 69 we have:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n#if TARGET_OS_TV\r\n/*! Whether or not the elment has UI focus. */\r\n@property (readonly) BOOL hasFocus;\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother solution to this issue would be to simply update [the documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1627636-hasfocus) to mention that this property is only available on tvOS. This is less preferable, but would at least solve part of the problem."
