    description: "Area: Lock Screen\r\n\r\nI have an app which allows the user to design a wallpaper image for use on the lock screen (or home screen if they choose). In descending order of desirability I would like to do one of these operations:\r\n\r\n1) Use an API to directly set an image as the Lock Screen from my app\r\n\r\n2) Do what the Photos app does to achieve this: add a \"Use as Wallpaper\" UIActivity to my app\r\n\r\n3) Open the system Settings directly into the Wallpaper settings section\r\n\r\n4) Open the system Settings at its root level -- not in my app's settings section (as UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString does).\r\n\r\nOr to put it more generally, do *something* better than telling my users: \"Now open Settings, go to Wallpaper, tap Choose a New Wallpaper, select the last image in the camera roll, tap Set and then Set Lock Screen\". Which is a lot of steps."
