    description: "When CarPlay external display is connected, keyboard cannot be invoked in the application on the phone side until user clicks on textfield. \r\nDirectly clicking on textfield works every time, but calling keyboard programmatically doesn't.\r\n \r\nNote: As soon as the user clicks on textfield, invoking keyboard from code starts working.\r\n\r\nHappens on all devices and simulators."
