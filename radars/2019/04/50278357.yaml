    description: "# Summary\r\n\r\nWhen deleting a selection of iMessage messages, it's easy to accidentally delete the whole conversation.\r\n\r\nAffects: iOS 12.2\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* open an iMessage conversation\r\n* long-press on a message then tap \"More\" to enter edit-mode\r\n* select several message\r\n* observe two delete buttons: one \"Delete All\" in the navigation bar, one delete icon \U0001F5D1 in the bottom toolbar\r\n* one button deletes the whole conversation, the other deletes just the selected messages\r\n* note that it's easy to misinterpret \"Delete All\" to mean \"Delete All Selected\"\r\n\r\n(I have watched someone accidentally delete the whole conversation by making this mistake)\r\n\r\n# Recommendation\r\n\r\n* recognise that when a user has selected individual messages, their intent is probably to delete just those\r\n* the \"Delete All\" button should be unavailable when individual messages are selected\r\n* or the \"Delete All\" button is renamed to \"Delete Selected\" when individual messages are selected\r\n\r\n(Ideally, I wouldn't ever want to see two different \"delete\" buttons on the screen at the same time)"
