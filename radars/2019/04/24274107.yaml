    description: "We have downloaded user data from the device into xcappdata package and are trying to start simulator with it to reproduce the user problem. Xcode does not load xcappdata even we have selected in Xcode scheme configuration Application Data and selected the xcappdata package.\r\n\r\nWe are also using xcappdata to setup tests with the complex data structures of the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project using the “Master-Detail Application” template that uses Core Data.\r\n2. Run the application on a device.\r\n3. Add 5 items.\r\n4. You may stop running the application on your device—the following steps aren’t affected by it running or not.\r\n5. Open the Xcode Organizer, select the “Applications” section of your device under the Devices tab.\r\n6. Select your test application. You should see a bunch of folders and files populate the “Data files in Sandbox”. (This may not populate right away, so be patient.)\r\n7. Click the “Download” button at the bottom and save the xcappdata package to your Desktop, giving it a descriptive name like 'v0 - 5 items.xcappdata'.\r\n8. Click “Delete” to remove the application from the device—we will try to start with a clean install for the next steps.\r\n9. Create a new Group in your project. I name mine “Test Data”.\r\n10. Add v0 - 5 items.xcappdata to the group.\r\n11. Select “Copy items into group folder”.\r\n12. Do not add it to any targets.\r\n13. Launch the app while holding the Option key—either Option-clicking the Run button, or Option-Command-R. A scheme configuration sheet will appear.\r\n14. In the Options tab, select v0 - 5 items.xcappdata from the Application Data menu and click “Run”.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app would launch with 5 records pre-installed, based on the xcappdata package.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app always launches fresh.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 and 7.3 beta"
