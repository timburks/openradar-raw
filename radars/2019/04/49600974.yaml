    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using username/password autofill from the keyboard ribbon in webkit views in apps, the password doesnt get filled out. Additionally it seems to delete the last character from the most recently selected input field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure your keychain has a username/password entry for the bol.com app in your keychain\r\n2. Open the bol.com app, tap the Login button (Inloggen)\r\n3. Skip the modal keychain view that shows your user accounts to prevent the fields from being autofilled and submitted\r\n4. Tap either the e-mail address (E-mailadres) or password (Wachtwoord) field to trigger the keyboard with keychain suggestions in the ribbon.\r\n5. Tap one of the suggestions in the ribbon, and use Face ID / Touch ID / Code to attempt to have username and password filled in. (Nothing happens)\r\n6. Put random text in the username or password field, repeat from step 4 and see the last character disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsername and password get filled in in the designated fields, worst case nothing gets deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsername and password do not get filled in, last characted in input field gets deleted.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTested on multiple iOS versions, really broken since iOS 12.2. Because we wanted to make sure this is an OS bug and not an app bug, we've also tested it in another app (Coolblue, one of our competitors, behavior is the same in their app.\r\n\r\niOS 12.1:\r\nEverything still works as expected\r\n\r\niOS 12.1.2:\r\nLast character gets deleted but username and password get filled in successfully after that (so this is weird but still functional)\r\n\r\niOS 12.2:\r\nLast character gets deleted and nothing gets filled in (this is not functional anymore)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBefore running app, in device go to Settings -> Password & Accounts -> AutoFill Passwords turn on"
