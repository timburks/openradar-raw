    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nVNC Viewers connected to Screen Sharing will hang when switching between spaces. This has been observed with a number of different VNC Viewers, suggesting that there is a problem with the Screen Sharing server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEnable screen sharing on a mac (henceforth referred to as the remote machine) by going into System preferences->Sharing and enabling Screen sharing.\r\nGo to \"Computer settings...\" and enable \"VNC viewer may control screen with password:\"\r\nConnect to screen sharing using a VNC Viewer. For example https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/\r\nor https://www.uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc.html\r\nor https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php\r\nMake sure more than one space is configured by pressing \"Ctrl+up arrow\".\r\nSwitch spaces rapidly by pressing \"ctrl+right arrow\" and then back again with \"ctrl+left arrow\".\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe viewer should update to show the same as the remote machine\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe viewer will hang for some time without updating it's frame buffer.\r\nSome viewers have a \"refresh screen\" button which will sometimes fix the problem (until it happens again).\r\nSwitching desktop is a reliable way to reproduce this problem, but not the only way. The desktop will often freeze at some point during normal operation. Sometimes the viewer will then unfreeze after a number of seconds.\r\nMouse and keyboard events will go through as normal.\r\nThis problem has happened with every VNC client that we have tried, namely: VNC Connect, UVNC, and TightVNC. It does not happen when connecting from an Apple screen sharing client.\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nOS X 10.13.6 and 10.14.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)"
