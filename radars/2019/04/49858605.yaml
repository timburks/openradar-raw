    description: "Area:\r\nCore Graphics\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I include a PDF asset in my app and preserve vector information, then use CoreGraphics to render it as a template with custom colors, if I render below the PDF's native size, the coloring is only applied to part of the image\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun attached app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth images show the silhouette in blue on a red background\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe small image (rendered below the PDF's native size) only draws part of the foreground in blue\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11-12.2, Xcode 10.1-10.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've seen this issue on every device I've tested on.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I can render the image at the PDF's native size (72x72 in this case) and then the coloring is applied correctly."
