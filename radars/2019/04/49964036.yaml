    description: "Area:\r\nCamera\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you open Markup on a photo from the Camera app, and then close the app (e.g. by pressing the home button) and then you go back into Markup (any photo), nothing happens when you try to draw / mark up the photo\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Camera app + take a photo and tap on the new photo (or open an existing photo)\r\n2. Tap on Edit\r\n3. Tap on circle with three dots\r\n4. Tap Markup (can verify at this point you can draw on the photo with any of the markup tools, but you don't actually need to draw to reproduce the bug)\r\n5. Tap the home button to leave the app\r\n6. Reopen the Camera app\r\n7. Open a photo from the bottom left corner\r\n8 .Tap edit\r\n9. Tap circle with three dots\r\n10. Tap Markup\r\n11. Try to mark up the image but nothing works. You can select tools, colours, opacities but you cannot make a mark on the image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCan markup as usual without having to force quit the app first.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot markup any photos. Have to force quit the Camera app to do markup again.\r\n\r\nNote, if you markup in the Photos app and then leave the photos app, the next time you return to the Photos app if the app is still active it will still show the markup, whereas for the Camera it seems to automatically dismiss the markup (I guess the idea is so that when you return to the camera you always see the camera right away)\r\n\r\nVideo attached â€” you can't really tell from the video but obviously at the end I'm trying to draw on the screen but it's not working. And as I mentioned, you can force quit the app and it goes back to normal.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.2 (16E227)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7, also confirmed occurs on iPad"
