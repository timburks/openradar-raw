    description: "JSONDecoder does not support decoding URLs with umlauts.\r\n\r\nThis makes it cumberstone to use  as decoding such objects currently leads to a dataCorrupted error.\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER FROM APPLE:\r\n\r\nAs this isnâ€™t a validly encoded url this is the general \"going from something that is not a valid URL in some aspects but we made it a valid URL\". Anytime we correct a URL string from what we were originally given, there's a chance that we changed the resource it refers to and that's the kind of behavior \"bad guys\" look to exploit. For now the best thing to do would be to make sure the URL is encoded properly first before sending it in your payload."
