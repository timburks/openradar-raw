    description: "In Safari 12.1 (14607.1.40.1.4) for macOS, when I select a password to AutoFill, it will automatically submit the form. I appreciate the idea behind this and I've tried to get used to it. However I continue to find it very frustrating, and in some cases I am no longer able to AutoFill passwords due to the new behavior.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is with forms where I need to enter my existing password to confirm a change in my account. For example I am trying to fill out a form here: https://account.postmarkapp.com/user_email/edit This form has fields for \"New email address\" and \"Password\". Normally I would type the new email address, select a password to fill in, and then submit the form. This used to work fine—in some cases it might fill my username into the wrong field, but I could always correct it before submitting the form.\r\n\r\nIn Safari 12.1, I am no longer able to AutoFill my password on this form. If I do, it will fill my username in the \"new email address\" field, and immediately submit the form. This happens even if I have already filled in the email address. Also, my username is not even an email address.\r\n\r\nAnother common frustration I've had is that I have to remember to check the \"remember me\" box before I fill in my password now. Most of the time this happens because the password suggestions appear immediately and they cover up the \"remember me\" box. Even if I remember to check the box first I still have to dismiss the suggestions, check the box, then go back to the password field—it's far more of a hassle than it used to be.\r\n\r\nEven if the \"remember me\" box is not covered up, I often just forget I need to check it first. I don't think users should be expected to know they need to fill in login forms from the bottom up."
