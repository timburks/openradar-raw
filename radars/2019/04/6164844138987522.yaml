    description: "Area: UIKit\r\n\r\nPreparation:\r\n - UINavigationController’s stack,\r\n - 2 consequent UIViewControllers\r\n - both of them have UISearchBar (through setting navigationItem.searchController in viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear, doesn’t matter which method is used)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nOption #1 (PUSH):\L \r\n - Run the app, pull down the search bar on the first screen\r\n - Push the second screen animated\r\n - Pay attention to the push transition\r\nOption #2 (POP):\L \r\n - Run the app, push the second screen\r\n - Pull down the search bar on the second screen\r\n - Pop the second screen animated\r\n - Pay attention to the pop transition\r\n\r\nNOW PROBLEM:\r\n - SearchBar’s background is hanging over the content of the appearing screen until the transition is done, then the bar disappears without any animation\r\nThe bug is easily reproducable in the official WWDC application\r\n\r\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:\L - FilesApp, strangely, does not have such a bug, it seems to have a completely customized NavigationBar (WHY THOUGH). It works perfectly, it must work this way everywhere. \r\n+ ability to pull the searchBar with scroll"
