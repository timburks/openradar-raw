    description: "Xcode's Image literal picker UI needs improvement. There are several issues...\r\n\r\n- In dark mode, dark images are barely visible\r\n- Cannot scroll all the way to bottom (see in the image attached, the scrollbar reaches the bottom but the content is still not all visible)\r\n- Provide a search box for images. There are a lot of images and it's hard to find the one I want by just scrolling+looking at all of them.\r\n\r\nWould be great if you guys can address this. Thanks!"
