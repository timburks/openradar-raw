    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Refactor function on function or method name, sometimes it cripples the updated name of some occurrences â€“ usually puts the updated name twice in follow somewhere. See the attached video.\r\n\r\nI've just ran into this issue in Xcode 10.2. Same way as demonstrated in the attached video, when trying to rename a protocol method.\r\n\r\nSeems like it's way more bug-prone within the @selector() tag.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4.1\r\nXcode 10 all betas\r\nXcode 10.2"
