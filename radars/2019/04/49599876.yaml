    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe /usr/bin/symbols program in Xcode can fail on certain types of mach-o objects and DWARF data, and does not provide much helpful information about why those mach-o objects are being rejected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee three attachements: go.o.broken, go.o.nodwarf, go.o.dwarf\r\n\r\n`symbols go.o.broken` produces a confusing error message, even though the command exits with status 0.\r\n\r\n`symbols go.o.nodwarf` works as expected, producing symbol data from the TEXT segment.\r\n\r\n`symbols go.o.dwarf` states the object is Empty, even though DWARF data is present.\r\n\r\nSee next comment for detailed output and analysis of each command.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n$ symbols -v\r\nsymbols version:                        @(#)PROGRAM:symbols  PROJECT:SamplingTools-64490.33\r\nCoreSymbolicationDT.framework version:  64490.26\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n$ uname -a\r\nDarwin tmm1-imac.lan 18.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.2.0: Thu Dec 20 20:46:53 PST 2018; root:xnu-4903.241.1~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64"
