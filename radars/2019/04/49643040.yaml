    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIKit gives us UITraitCollection which is great. It lets us control the context our views render in. Unfortunately when using UITraitCollection(layoutDirection: .rightToLeft) the built in UIKit controls do not behave as you would expect. This inhibits our ability to test for these conditions.\r\n\r\nPlease see this gist: https://gist.github.com/crayment/8d9e9b97796b42e98d1d0a9ac5622bc8\r\n\r\nAnd some more discussion around it in the context of snapshot testing here: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/issues/168\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a UIViewController\r\n- Call setOverrideTraitCollection with UITraitCollection(layoutDirection: .rightToLeft)\r\n- Add UIButtons, UILabels, UITextFields, UISwitches, etc to the view of the UIVIewController\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- UILabel's to wrap on the right\r\n- UITextFields placeholders to be right aligned\r\n- UISwitch to be ON when on the left\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Everything appears in left to right mode. Although UISwitch does seem to correct itself when interacted with.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B91)"
