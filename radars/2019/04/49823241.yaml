    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Accessibility setting to enable zooming with Control-Scroll, the mouse cursor drifts up and to the left during the scroll event.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Command-Option-F5 to bring up Accessibility Options.\r\n2. Make sure \"Enable Zoom\" is checked.\r\n3. Dismiss Accessibility Options.\r\n4. Hold the Control key and scroll up (two fingers on a trackpad) to zoom in.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCursor stays fixed relative to the content behind it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor drifts up and to the left as you scroll.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14.4 (18E226) (confirmed with a few different people)\r\n\r\nDoes not repro in these conditions:\r\n- 10.14.3 (at all - this is a 10.14.4 regression)\r\n- 10.14.4 (when using a \"zoom window\" instead of a full screen zoom)\r\n\r\nAttached videos also linked here: https://cl.ly/43452016fabe"
