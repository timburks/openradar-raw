    description: "Summary: lldp-rpc-server crashes which results in Xcode displaying a message 'Could not attach to pid : \"pid\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a new single-view iOS application.\r\nSelect a simulator and select Product->Run.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The app should launch in the simulator and lldb should connect to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The app does launch in the simulator but lldb can't connect to it because it has crashed (and left a crash log in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/).\r\n\r\nIt seems that I can work around the issue (i.e., the rpc server won't crash) if I enable the Address Sanitizer or the Thread Sanitizer before running. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Xcode 10.2"
