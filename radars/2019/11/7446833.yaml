    description: "When presenting modally a view controller which contains a table view, the selectionStyle can have an impact on the time it takes to dismiss this view controller.\r\n\r\nWhen selectionStyle is set to UITableViewCell.SelectionStyle.default, the view controller dismisses almost immediately. \r\nHowever setting the value to UITableViewCell.SelectionStyle.none, result in an unpredictable amount of time before the dismiss occurs.\r\nThis seems to affect the new modal presentation style in iOS 13, since setting the modal presentation style to fullscreen or running on iOS 12/11, donâ€™t have the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\nTap a cell with selectionStyle of UITableViewCell.SelectionStyle.default. Observe the view controller is dismissed immediately.\r\n\r\nTap a cell with selectionStyle of UITableViewCell.SelectionStyle.none. Observe it takes a long time to dismiss the view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe view controller should be dismiss immediately regardless of the selection style used.\r\n\r\nActuel results:\r\nThe view controller takes time to dismiss when the selectionStyle is set to UITableViewCell.SelectionStyle.none."
