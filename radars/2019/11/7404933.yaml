    description: "# Please describe the issue:\r\nWe have UI components that use dynamic colours. During XCTests, a label with textColor assigned to a dynamic colour value automatically changes colour when we set `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` to `.light` or `.dark` during the test. However, the background colour of a UIView does not do the same. This seems to be a limitation that occurs within XCTest cases only (they work fine when using the actual app).\r\n\r\n# Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\nYou can see a minimal reproduction of the issue here: https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-ios/blob/90b51e104850f1c0fd70d7d5832fa3bf6d11de89/Example/SnapshotTests/BPKBorkedDarkModeSnapshotTest.m\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the forced-dark UILabel correctly updates the textColor, but the UIView does not correctly update the `backgroundColor`: https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-ios/blob/90b51e104850f1c0fd70d7d5832fa3bf6d11de89/Example/BackpackTests/ReferenceImages_64/BPKBorkedDarkModeSnapshotTest/testBorkednessOfXCTestsWithDarkmodeOverrides_dark-mode%402x.png vs https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-ios/blob/90b51e104850f1c0fd70d7d5832fa3bf6d11de89/Example/BackpackTests/ReferenceImages_64/BPKBorkedDarkModeSnapshotTest/testBorkednessOfXCTestsWithDarkmodeOverrides_light-mode%402x.png\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in Xcode Version 11.0 (11A420a) as well as Xcode Version 11.2 beta 2 (11B44).\r\n\r\n# What did you expect to happen?\r\nI would expect all dynamic colours in the UIView to change colour based on the UIView `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` value.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nOnly some of the dynamic colours are being updated."
