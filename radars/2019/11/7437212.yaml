    description: "I could not find `CoreServices` as an area to file this problem so I chose `Foundation` instead.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThe latest documentation says `UTTypeCopyPreferredTagWithClass` returns \r\n\r\n> An array of tags (as CFStrings), or NULL if there was no translation available to convert the uniform type identifier to the specified class.\r\n\r\nAccording to [the document](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/1442744-uttypecopypreferredtagwithclass).\r\n(And I attach the archive just in case: https://web.archive.org/web/20190621082901/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/1442744-uttypecopypreferredtagwithclass)\r\n\r\nHowever its method signature is `Unmanaged<CFString>?` and actually it doesn't return *an array of CFStrings*.\r\nI tried to advance the pointer but it didn't return anything but raised EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception.\r\n\r\nI guess the problem is due to rather the documentation than the actual behavior but this contradiction is confusing so I'd like you to fix this problem (of course or documentation)."
