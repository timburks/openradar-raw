    description: "## Problem\r\n\r\nThe following Swift snippet prints `text/javascript`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(UTTypeCopyPreferredTagWithClass(\"com.netscape.javascript-source\" as CFString, kUTTagClassMimeType)!.takeRetainedValue())\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4329#page-9, `text/javascript` has been obsoleted and `application/javascript` is declared instead.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since RFC 4329 was published and nowadays the most of browsers support `application/javascript` so please consider to migrate to the new one."
