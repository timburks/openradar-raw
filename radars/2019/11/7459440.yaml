    description: "Description\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nSign in with Apple button needs to be initialised with a specific ASAuthorizationAppleIDButtonStyle (eg Black or White).\r\n\r\nHaving created such a button, it does not change automatically to respect user interface style (ie Dark Mode).\r\n\r\nI would like an additional style (maybe ASAuthorizationAppleIDButtonStyleSystem) that has the \"Black\" appearance in Light Mode and \"White\" appearance in Dark Mode.\r\nOr I would like to at least be able to update the style at runtime so that I can subclass the button myself and change the appearance when the system setting is changed.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the style is readonly, meaning that the only way to achieve the correct behaviour specified by the guidelines is to remove one button from the hierarchy, instantiate a new one, and add it back."
