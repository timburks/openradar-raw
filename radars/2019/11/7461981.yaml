    description: "On iOS 13.2, UIButton renders some symbols (I tested with symbols based on `circle`, but more could be affected) incorrectly.\r\nThe width of the image is shorter than its height, were we would expect both to be equal.\r\nThis makes the symbols appear distorded, \"squished\" horizontally.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `circle` symbol, when used in a UIButton with its font defined as \"Body\", a Regular weight and a Medium scale, is rendered with a height of 34px and a width of 32px.\r\n\r\nNote that using the same symbol in a UIImage of the same size renders the circle correcly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Create a new Xcode project based on the \"Single View App\" template\r\n- In the main storyboard, add a new UIButton\r\n- Set the UIButton image to `circle` (the SF Symbol)\r\n- Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The symbol is displayed as a \"perfect\" circle, i.e. round, with its height equal to its width.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The symbol is s, with its with 2px smaller than its height.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n- Some screenshots demonstrating the issue\r\n    - MultipleExamples.png shows different styles of rendering the symbol, most of them distorded\r\n    - ZoomedCircleSymbol.png shows the circle symbol rendered at multiple sizes (in green), with a red circle overlayed to the image in Photoshop as a reference of how the symbol should have been rendered\r\n- A project with multiple UIButtons and UIImages exhibiting this issue\r\n    - The same project can be found here: https://github.com/guillaumealgis/UIButton-SFSymbol-Squished\r\n- A stackoverflow answer detailing the same issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58338420/sf-symbol-looks-distorted/58999056"
