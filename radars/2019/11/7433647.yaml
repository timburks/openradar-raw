    description: "It appears that the new iOS 13 API -[UIImage baselineOffsetFromBottom] reports the offset in pixels, not points.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- [UIImage systemImageNamed:@“lock.fill”].\r\n- Save the image to disk so you can examine it (attached is the image, produced from an iPhone 11 Pro, for your convenience). You will observe that the actual baseline offset from bottom is 1pt (or 3px).\r\n\r\nExpected Results (on a 3x display-scale system, like iPhone 11 Pro):\r\n-[[UIImage systemImageNamed:@lock.fill”] baselineOffsetFromBottom] == 1.0\r\n\r\nActual Results (on a 3x display-scale system, like iPhone 11 Pro):\r\n-[[UIImage systemImageNamed:@lock.fill”] baselineOffsetFromBottom] == 3.0"
