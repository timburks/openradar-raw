    description: "This issue has to do with view controller containment: invalidation for bounds is not happening when custom view controller containing collection view:\r\n1) uses view layout constraints and put into container view controller with layout constraints OR manual frame setting\r\n2) put to navigation controller either directly or in a container view controller\r\n\r\nThis issue can be reproduced as of iOS 13.\r\n\r\nFor additional detail see the attached project. Run it on iOS 13 and rotate a device -- notice the collection view has proper bounds while its layout is not updated (stripes are not edge to edge)."
