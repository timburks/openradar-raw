    description: "When using any of the ImageIO APIs to set the GPS properties of an image, the GPS values don’t persist on the Image file on some devices.\r\n\r\n- Works fine on iOS 13.1 Simulator\r\n- Works fine on iOS 12.0 or later Simulator/Device\r\n\r\nI’m able to reproduce this issue on multiple iOS 13 hardware devices (iPad and iPhone), in a sample empty project. The same code works fine on iOS 12.1 devices (iPad and iPhone) as well as on iOS 13.1 Simulators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the ModifyGPS Xcode Project.\r\n2. Add a Breakpoint to Line 54\r\n3. Run on iOS 12.1 Device\r\n\r\nAlso Perform Steps on iOS 13.0 Device. Note that the {GPS} dictionary key/value does not exist on the photo after running `updateImageAtURL:withLocation:` on iOS 13 devices."
