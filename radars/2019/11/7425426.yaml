    description: "# Description\r\n\r\nWhen initiating a drag in a scroll view with a non-zero contentInset from a partly visible UIRefreshControl, targetContentOffset is reported incorrectly.  Sometimes it's ~20px off, other times it's ~100+ off.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1) Attach UIRefreshControl onto UIScrollView\r\n2) Give the scroll view a non-zero contentInset (can be done via additionalSafeAreaInsets)\r\n3) Scroll down to begin slightly presenting the refresh control\r\n4) Swipe up and release with a non-zero velocity\r\n5) Observe that targetContentOffset & the ending scrollView.contentOffset are different\r\n\r\nSee attached sample project.  fatalError's if `targetContentOffset.y != scrollView.contentOffset.y Â± 0.5` when scrolling finishes.\r\nSee attached video for visual example of STRs.\r\n\r\n# Expected Result\r\n\r\ntargetContentOffset is accurately reported based on the adjustedContentInset and present UIRefreshControl\r\n\r\n# Actual Result\r\n\r\ntargetContentOffset is reported inaccurately after partially showing an attached UIRefreshController with a non-zero contentInset"
