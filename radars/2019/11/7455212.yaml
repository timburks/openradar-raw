    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/text_display_and_fonts/adding_a_custom_font_to_your_app?language=swift#2939905\r\n\r\nThe above documentation says that developers who want to use custom fonts need to register a font file name to Info.plist's UIAppFonts key.\r\n\r\nHowever, Xcode 10 or above automatically sets the key during Info.plist Preprocessing build phase and the final Info.plist embedded in an app contains UIAppFonts even when the developer doesn't specify it manually.\r\nI don't think it is a bug in Xcode build system but one in the documentation.\r\nIf the behavior is intended (I believe so), please update the documentation about it."

    title: Registering UIAppFonts is automatically managed by Xcode but the document says it should be manually done
