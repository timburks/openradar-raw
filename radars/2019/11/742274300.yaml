    description: "[The actual item number in Feedback Assistant is FB7422743]\r\n\r\nIn SE-0106 (implemented in Swift 3), the name \"macOS\" was added as an alias for \"OSX\" in contexts where an operating system name should appear, such as \"#if os()\" and \"if #available()\".  However, Xcode does not offer \"macOS\" as an autocompletion value in these contexts.  If the user types \"Mac\", Xcode 11 offers \"macCatalyst\" as an autocompletion (Xcode 10.3 offers \"iosMac\").\r\n\r\nApparently the Swift compiler will continue to accept \"OSX\" for backward compatibility, but after four years it would seem reasonable for Xcode to offer \"macOS\" as the preferred name.  (Whether Xcode should continue offering \"OSX\" is up to Apple.)"
