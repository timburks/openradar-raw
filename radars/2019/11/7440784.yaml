    description: "We are using xcode-index-preferences.json for the purpose of enabling full index store visibility (`EnableFullStoreVisibility`). Previously this was possible by setting `EnabledFullIndexStoreVisibility` in WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings.\r\n\r\nWhen we adopted xcode-index-preferences.json, we found that Xcode would this file relative to the `.xcodeproj` but not relative to an `.xcworkspace`. For example we used to have:\r\n\r\nLyft.xcodeproj\r\nLyft.xcworkspace\r\n\r\nThese files were siblings to each other in the root of the project. However in order to have xcode-index-preferences.json apply to our project, we found had to delete our Lyft.xcworkspace. Note that we store xcode-index-preferences.json at the root of the project too.\r\n\r\nIf in the future we feel we need to use an `.xcworkspace` again, then it would be nice to have xcode-index-preferences.json work when placed beside the `.xcworkspace` in the root of our project."
