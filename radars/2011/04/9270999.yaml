    description: "Summary:\r\nIn browsers that correctly implement the Core Animation drawing model NPAPI spec (Chrome, Firefox), the QuickTime plugin leaks a QTMovieLayer (and other associated objects, like QTMovieLayerPrivate) every time the plugin is instantiated in CA mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Chrome on 10.6\r\n2) Go to a page with a non-transparent QT plugin; e.g.:\r\n    http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/thegirlonthetrain/\r\n3) Repeatedly open and close the trailer popup while running under Instruments\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo leaks\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA QTMovieLayer is leaked every time the popup is closed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue is almost certainly that QuickTime implements the memory model that Safari implemented for the CA drawing model prior to the spec actually being accepted into NPAPI. As part of the spec process, the memory semantics of the returned CALayer changed. According to the spec, the QuickTime plugin is responsible for balancing its own retain and release counts on the Layer it vends.\r\nSee https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58282 for discussion."
