    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nDevelopers are often confused about how to best file Radars. Internal Apple engineers provide helpful guidance, but because there is no official spokesperson, sometimes it is unclear whether this advice is opinion or Apple committed policies. Partly as a result of this lack of communication, developers frequently share information about Radars on blogs and third-party sites such as Twitter and Open Radar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPost a question about Radar on Twitter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOne of Apple's DTS evangelists would reply with links to published documentation to resolve questions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOne or more Apple engineers reply with helpful information, but because this is not their main area of focus, this information can be terse or of questionable authority, as evidenced by followup discussion."
