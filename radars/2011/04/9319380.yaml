    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen doing multi-file search and replace operations in large projects, itâ€™s reasonable to want to start a search and then begin typing in the replacement text. However, when the first search result appears, the replacement text field loses focus, making this impractical.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Open a large project.\r\n* Show the Search Navigator and select Replace mode.\r\n* Type in a search phrase and press return.\r\n* Select the replacement text field and start typing replacement text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* The replacement text field should keep focus until the user interacts with some other view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* When the first search result is added to the result list, the replacement text field loses focus.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not happen in Xcode 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis only seems to happen with the first search result. Subsequent search results do not affect focus."
