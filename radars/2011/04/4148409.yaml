    description: "14-Jun-2005 11:02 PM Dair Grant:\r\nCreate a new Carbon Application project in Xcode 2.1, and invoke the get info window for the Release configuration on the target.\r\n\r\nCheck the \"Generate Profiling Code\" option (to turn it on, from its initial off state), and the list will scroll to the bottom. Similarly for the reverse operation - make any changes in the target's view of the build configuration, and the configuration list will scroll to the bottom.\r\n\r\nMaking the same changes to the configurations in the project get info window works as expected; there is no excessive scrolling."
