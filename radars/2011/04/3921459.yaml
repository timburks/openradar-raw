    description: "15-Dec-2004 11:14 AM Dair Grant:\r\nCFXMLNodeGetString produces \"flattened\" output, suitable for re-parsing but not particularly useful for humans.\r\n\r\nWe would like to use CF's XML support to read, edit, then write some xml files that must stay human-readable, however this requires us to write our own walking code in order to dump out formatted output (i.e., indented).\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to do everything with the CF parser, in which case we would need a CFXMLNodeGetStringWithOptions (or similar) that would allow us to control what whitespace was added to the output (newlines, indent size, indent as tabs or spaces, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n'System Profile.spx.zip' was successfully uploaded"
