Open Xcode. \r\n2. Type some code in. \r\n3. Scroll with a multi-touch trackpad. I used the one on my Mid 2010 13” MBP. Watch the line numbers. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: The line numbers stay readable.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The line numbers become distorted (clipping?). I am not sure what the official term is.\r\n\r\nRegression: Bug only happens when scrolling with a multi-touch trackpad. Sometimes, it only happens at certain scrolling speeds.\r\n\r\nNotes: None."
