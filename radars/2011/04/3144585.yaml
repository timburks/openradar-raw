    description: "11-Jan-2003 10:46 AM Dair Grant:\r\n* SUMMARY \r\nOn Mac OS 9, the Finder would prevent you from deleting a folder if a file of the same name was dropped into the same location (with a \"You cannot replace the folder XXX because a folder cannot be replaced by a file\". On Mac OS X, the Finder simply provides the normal OK-to-replace dialog.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE \r\n1. Create a folder called \"test\".\r\n2. Drop a file called \"test\" into the folder containing the folder called \"test\".\r\n3. Accept the standard OK-to-replace dialog.\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nThe folder called \"test\", and its contents, will be deleted.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nI would prefer the Mac OS 9 approach, or alternatively to reword the OK-to-replace dialog when a folder is being replaced by a file. If reworded, it should make it clearer that test, and everything inside it, will be deleted - when this has happened to me I've often clicked OK without realising just how much stuff I'm about to delete.\r\n\r\nSo far I've never actually wanted to replace a folder with a file - only a file with a file, or a folder with a folder. Replace a folder with a file is rare enough (and dangerous enough) that a more explicit warning would be useful."
