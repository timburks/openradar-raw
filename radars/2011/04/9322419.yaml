    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nActivity Monitor has a \"Disk Usage\" tab that shows how much disk capacity is in use and how much disk capacity is not. To describe these two states it has:\r\n\r\nSpace utilized\r\n\r\nSpace free\r\n\r\n\"Space utilized\" ?? If it has been \"utilized\" then it's no longer space. If it is space, then it is by definition free.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Activity Monitor\r\nClick on Disk Usage tab\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNicely worded and clear description of disk capacity state. For example, how about:\r\n\r\nAmount in use\r\n\r\nAmount unused\r\n\r\nor simply:\r\n\r\nUsed:\r\n\r\nUnused:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGagging.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
