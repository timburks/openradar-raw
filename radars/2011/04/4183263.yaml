    description: "16-Jul-2005 12:02 PM Dair Grant:\r\nWhen Xcode is displaying a build configuration option whose value is different in different configurations, it displays a \"multiple values\" or a dashed checkbox.\r\n\r\nTo determine exactly which value is selected for each configuration, you need to manually pick each configuration in turn from the list of configurations and watch the value change as you cycle through them.\r\n\r\nFor these mixed options, the notes pane at the bottom could provide a summary of the values that are currently active for that item. This summary would only be shown if there was multiple values, but would allow you to double-check these items at a glance rather than checking each configuration in turn.\r\n\r\nE.g., we have Fix & Continue turned on for Debug builds but off for Release builds. The notes for this item are:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nActivating this setting indicates that binaries should be built for use with Fix & Continue. This setting is enabled by default for Debug build configurations. Note: It is recommended that release or deployment builds NOT be built for use with Fix & Continue. Only applies to GCC 3.3. [GCC_ENABLE_FIX_AND_CONTINUE, -ffix-and-continue]\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis would be more useful as:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nNotes:\r\n    Activating this setting indicates that binaries should be built for use with Fix & Continue.\r\n    This setting is enabled by default for Debug build configurations.
