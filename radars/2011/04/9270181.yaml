    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the \"Repositories\" tab of the Organizer, there is a handy feature that allows you to select a commit and view all the changes on all the files in that commit. Although the list of changed files can obtain keyboard-focus, it is impossible to move around in this list with the arrow-keys (or any other key I've tried so far).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the \"Repositories\" tab of the Organizer window, select a repository and click on the disclosure triangle next to the name of a commit that affected more than one file.\r\n2. Click the \"View Changes\" button.\r\n3. In the sheet that appears, make sure that the left-hand view has keyboard focus (through either clicking or shift-tabbing to it).\r\n4. Press any of the following keys to change the currently selected file:\r\n - up-, down-, left-, right-arrow (with any combination of modifier keys)\r\n - any of the alpha-numeric keys (with any combination of option, shift, control)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nArrow keys move the file selection.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n*crickets*\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nunknown\r\n\r\nNotes:"
