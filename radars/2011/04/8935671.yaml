    description: "30-Jan-2011 05:04 PM Ryan Eisworth:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn some situations, when a user clicks the \"Edit\" button for an iCal event, the tooltip will move to a different location on-screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch iCal.\r\n2. Select Month view, if it is not selected already.\r\n3. Create an event on any day if there is not already an event visible.\r\n4. Double-click the event title so that the tooltip box displays showing more information about the event.\r\n5. Using the window titlebar, move the iCal window to a different place on screen.\r\n6. Click the edit button on the event's toolitp.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe event tooltip should expand to allow editing in its present location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tooltip will slide across the screen to its initial location (prior to moving the iCal window) before expanding to allow the event to be edited. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem does not exist with iCal 3.0.8 build 1287, which is the latest version for OS 10.5.x.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
