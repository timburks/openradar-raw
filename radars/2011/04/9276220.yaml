    description: "12-Apr-2011 06:27 PM Steve Streza:\r\nThe iOS Simulator is frequently used by my company to build network-based applications. As part of this, we need the ability to simulate a sudden network failure, as one may run into in the wild. This is currently impossible to do on the iPhone Simulator; one must use Airplane Mode on the device or make an actual network problem happen, both of which are slow and deficient. A \"Simulate Network Failure\" or \"Simulate Airplane Mode\" feature could be used to block incoming/outgoing network traffic and trigger the Reachability APIs so that we can debug network applications in a more controlled environment."
