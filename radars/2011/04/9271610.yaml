    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently it's possible lazy load an image by constructing it using -[NSImage imageNamed:].\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there's no way to do this if you're loading multiple image representations from different files. This means that data is read from disk even if it is never used.\r\n\r\nA new API should be added that support loading image representations as need. Alternatively, +[NSImageRep imageRepWithContentsOfFile:] should lazy load its data by default.\r\n\r\nThis is need to support high resolution icons in Mac OS X Lion.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSailesh Agrawal"
