    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempting to use distributed builds with Xcode 4 fails mostly silently. Only the local machine is used. Machines have both Xcode 3.2.6 and Xcode 4.0/4A304a installed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLimited testing done. Nevertheless, since I have reproduced this on three machines, I conclude this is reproducible.\r\n1. Use a Snow Leopard Macbook late 2009. Use either Snow Leopard Mac Mini 2007 or another Snow Leopard Macbook late 2009.\r\n2. In Xcode, turn on both sharing of machine and use of other machines.\r\n3. Attempt to build using command line tool \"xcodebuild\" to get more output.\r\n\r\nI have observed that apparently, first build on a machine may get distributed. I am not certain this is truly so.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNetwork activity and distributed compilation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLocal compilation only. Output of xcodebuild begins with these lines:\r\n\r\ndistcc[161] (dcc_parse_multiplier) ERROR: bad multiplier \"/0,lzo,cpp\" in host specification\r\ndistcc[161] (dcc_show_hosts) CRITICAL! Failed to get host list\r\n/Xcode4/usr/bin/pump: error: pump mode requested, but distcc hosts list does not contain any hosts with ',cpp' option\r\n\r\nAfter these two, build log is printed correctly and as usual.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReported on at least two threads on Apple Developer Forums:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/413139\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/360809\r\nand on Stack Overflow:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5111647/xcode-distributed-build-failure"
