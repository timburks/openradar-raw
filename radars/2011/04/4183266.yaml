    description: "16-Jul-2005 01:21 AM Dair Grant:\r\nIf a #define is defined through a .xcconfig file:\r\n\r\n    GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS             = ZL_DEBUG=0\r\n\r\nThen code which redefines this value:\r\n\r\n    #define ZL_DEBUG    1\r\n\r\nProduces a warning in the build results pane:\r\n\r\n    warning: \"ZL_DEBUG\" redefined\r\n    warning: this is the location of the previous definition\r\n\r\nSelecting the first line takes you to the #define definition of the macro, however selecting the second line (which would normally take you to the previous definition) does nothing.\r\n\r\nIdeally selecting the second line should display the appropriate line from the .xcconfig file, or, given that this value could also be set in the project/target build configuration info window, the text should read :\"warning: this macro is already defined in this build configuration\" or similar."
