    description: "16-Apr-2011 08:23 PM Marc Hoyois:\r\nSummary:\r\nA message dispatched from within a handler to the window's beforeunload event is never received by an extension's global page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall the attached extension, visit any webpage, and close the page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn alert box \"message received\" should pop up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe message is received if the dispatch command is followed by an alert, so it might be a timing issue: the \"safari\" object in the injected script is deleted before the beforeunload handler is completely executed."
