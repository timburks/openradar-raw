    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOn recent 13\" MacBook Pro models that have only the integrated Intel HD 3000 GPU, a certain sequence of OpenGL calls involving multisampling and glPushAttrib causes a black screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Get a 13\" MacBook Pro with the Intel HD 3000 GPU.  (Alternately, you can use a recent 15\" or 17\" MacBook Pro, and install the gfxCardStatus utility from <http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus>, which can be used to force the machine to use the integrated graphics.)\r\n\r\n2. Open the sample program included in the attached archive.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe window shows two green rectangles.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nOne of the rectangles is black.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIf I allow my 15\" MacBook Pro to use the AMD discrete GPU, both rectangles are green.\r\n\r\nI have reproduced the bug on both Mac OS X 10.6.7 (10J3250), and 10.7 (11A419).\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn the source code, the key lines are glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE), glPushAttrib, glPopAttrib, and glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE).  If you comment out glPushAttrib and glPopAttrib, or either the glEnable or glDisable, the bug goes away.  It doesn't seem to matter which attribute mask you pass to glPushAttrib."
