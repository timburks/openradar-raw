    description: "21-Feb-2008 09:13 PM Dair Grant:\r\nI have a project A that uses an .xcconfig file, and links to a static library built with another project B that uses a separate .xcconfig file.\r\n\r\nNo project, target, or .xcconfig file defines GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN and yet the value of this setting is different between project and target in project A.\r\n\r\nLooking at the compiler settings in project B shows that GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN is set to no, and the same setting is observed at the project level in project A. Looking at the compiler settings in the target of project A shows that GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN is set to yes - even though neither the .xcconfig, project, or target adjust this setting.\r\n\r\nThis produces a list of \"different visibility\" warnings from STL when project A comes to link, as its source files seem to be built against a different GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN value than project B.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms seem to be exactly the same as per this thread:\r\n\r\n  <http://lists.apple.com/archives/xcode-users/2007/Oct/msg00722.html>\r\n\r\nI'm unable to reproduce this in a stand-alone project, but am also unable to correct projects A and B short of explicitly defining GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN."
