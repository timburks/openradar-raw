    description: "11-Jul-2005 12:50 AM Dair Grant:\r\nI am building a project with four targets, each of which has two configuration styles.\r\n\r\nTo build, I use the Build Results window. Sometimes, when switching to a new target and then pressing the Build icon in the toolbar the build will stop immediately. Note that I do not press the Stop icon, or make any keystrokes - I simply click the Build icon then release the mouse.\r\n\r\nA screenshot showing the behaviour is attached. Pressing Build a second time at this point will allow the build to proceed without errors.\r\n\r\nRadar is not accepting attachments at present, so I have placed the screenshot at:\r\n\r\n  http://www.zonic.co.uk/tmp/build.png"
