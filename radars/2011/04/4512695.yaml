    description: "13-Apr-2006 10:11 AM Dair Grant:\r\nIf I insert the attached file into an HITextView using TXNSetDataFromCFURLRef, the link is discarded. This can be verified by loading the file into MLTEShowcase, where the link will also be discarded.\r\n\r\nFrom this it looks like MLTE's kTXNRichTextFormatData support does not appear to include hyperlinks - I would like to see MLTE support the same RTF attributes as the Cocoa text control, including hyperlinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Test.rtf' was successfully uploaded"
