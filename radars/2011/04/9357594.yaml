    description: "It would be nice if IOSurface on Mac OS X was an public, documented API. Right now, it is a framework that is merely mentioned in some places in the official documentation (see links below). However, there is no separate document describing the internals or usage of the framework.\r\nThis technology is very interesting for high-performance realtime applications that use inter-process communication and have to deal with textures on the graphics card. Therefore, detailed information on how texture sharing works, performance considerations, recommended design patterns (maybe including a recommended way of IPC), limits imposed by hardware, graphics card drivers or other software etc. would be very helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial documentation referencing IOSurface:\r\n\r\n1) CVPixelBuffer Reference:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/QuartzCore/Reference/CVPixelBufferRef/Reference/reference.html\r\n\r\n2) Technical Note TN2267: Video Decode Acceleration Framework Reference:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#technotes/tn2267/_index.html\r\n\r\n3) Mac OS X Technology Overview: Mac OS X Frameworks:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemFrameworks/SystemFrameworks.html"
