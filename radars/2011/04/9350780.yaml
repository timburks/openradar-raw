    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a memory warning has been received, while looking at the photos of an album in UIImagePickerController, and the user goes back to the albums list the table view has an incorrect top content inset. I.e. The first album is underneath the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Open Photos.app\r\n* Select an album\r\n* Simulate memory warning (or a real warning on the device)\r\n* Go back to the albums list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe first album entry should appear under the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe first album entry appears underneath the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a regression in iOS 4.3, as the bug does not occur on iOS (simulator) 4.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee movie: http://cl.ly/0u3O2H1J3L16082L350X"
