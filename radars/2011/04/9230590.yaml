    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an OpenGL based game that is frequently saving state data to NSUserDefaults. A performance issue has cropped up. After writing a small amount of data to NSUserDefaults, CPU usage would spike on the main thread and the UI would stop for a moment.\r\n\r\nInstruments shows a pretty odd call stack during the performance spike http://cl.ly/1i303H0x0U001C1B0i0U\r\n\r\nMy app does not have any keyboard support in it at all so the UIKeyboardImpl is unexpected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite some data to NSUserDefaults often.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMain thread activity spikes and UI freezes momentarily.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot possible at the moment.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe code snippet that causes the spike is pretty basic NSUD code :\r\n\r\n\tNSUserDefaults * defs = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];\r\n\t[defs setBool:gameInProgress forKey:kKeysSaveGameInProgress];\r\n\t[defs setInteger:numberOfPlayers forKey:kKeysSaveNumberOfPlayers];\r\n\t[defs setInteger:currentPlayer forKey:kKeysSaveCurrentPlayer];\r\n\t[defs setInteger:ticksP1 forKey:kKeysSaveTicksP1];\r\n\t[defs setInteger:ticksP2 forKey:kKeysSaveTicksP2];\r\n\r\nThis code is called every few seconds after user actions."
