    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe big Run button in the upper-left corner of the main Xcode 4 window really screws with developer's minds after stopping at a breakpoint.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Stop at a breakpoint.\r\n2) Do your breakpointy stuff.\r\n3) Look for a button to continue from a breakpoint.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou'd find the button at the top of the debugging pane.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou go to press the big Run button. And then you either press the button (and regret it) or you catch yourself (and wonder how much longer this UI pain is going to last.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nEven though the control layout in Xcode 3 was very similar, I never had this problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nYes, this is a strange bug to be writing but after several weeks with Xcode 4, I still find myself going to the big button. And in speaking with other developers, I find that I'm not alone. A LOT of us are doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other aspects of the UI changes in the new version, my brain doesn't appear to be adapting to this particular rearrangement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I also don't have any recommendation on how to fix the problem. The Run button is useful for launching the actions in the scheme. The continue button is also placed in a logical place (next to step over/in/out.) It all makes sense, yet my brain can't handle it.\r\n\r\nMaybe a big red pulsing arrow hovering above the continue button that says \"Click here, dummy!\". OK, maybe not. (Oh hey, and while we're on the subject, thanks for toning down the autoresizing animation in the NIB size inspector!)"
