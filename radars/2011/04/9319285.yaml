    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the text fields in the Search Navigator lose focus unexpectedly, all changes are lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Open a workspace and open the Search Navigator.\r\n* In the search field, enter some text, and leave the text field focussed.\r\n* Switch to any other navigator.\r\n* Switch back to the Search Navigator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* The text you entered should be in the search field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* The search field has been reverted to its state before editing began.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that navigator switching can happen automatically as an effect of Behaviours. I would argue that behaviour-driven switching should be suppressed when a text field is focussed and dirty. Even if this were the case, though, silently dropping text when manually switching navigators would be wrong."
