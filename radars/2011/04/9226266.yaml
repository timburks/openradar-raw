    description: "Summary: The ability to view the disassembly of a source file has been removed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open a project with a .m source file, look for \"Show Disassmbly\" menu item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Be able to show the assembler code created when the file is compiled.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Can not perform this action in Xcode 4\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is a feature I use a LOT during development, as it is the only way to know for sure if the source I am writing is going to product the assembly code I am expecting.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this is not, obviously, a replacement for proper profiling and good design. Rather I use it regularly when optimizing hot spots identified during profiling, or when coding some often used routine that I know will be  a hot spot (a blitter, sound mixer, vector math function, etc)."
