    description: "12-Aug-2006 11:01 AM Dair Grant:\r\nUsing the 'defaults' command to write values to an Info.plist file will replace the existing permissions of the file with 600.\r\n\r\nA more useful default would be 644, although ideally this tool should preserve the existing permissions of the file.\r\n\r\nA similar effect can be seen with plutil, although I'm not sure if that's because it invokes defaults underneath or uses the same API to rewrite the file."
