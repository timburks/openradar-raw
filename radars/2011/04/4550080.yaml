    description: "16-May-2006 08:53 PM Dair Grant:\r\nWhen an HIWebView view is used in a composited window, it suffers numerous redraw problems where the view is erased but does not draw.\r\n\r\nThis is most easily seen by assigning a non-white content colour to the window - actions such as focussing an edit field within a web form, showing/hiding the window toolbar, or resizing the window will cause the HIWebView to be erased and the window background colour to show through.\r\n\r\n20-May-2006 01:20 AM Dair Grant:\r\nAttached is an app which demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n'4550080.zip' was successfully uploaded"
