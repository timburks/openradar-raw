    description: "29-Apr-2004 11:33 AM Dair Grant:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen working with long source trees, one alternative to the lack of scroll bar is to make the preferences window quite wide and then adjust the column widths within the Source Trees data browser.\r\n\r\nThis works well, except if the window is resized - at which point the column widths are reset to their defaults.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Xcode \"Source Trees\" preferences pane.\r\n\r\n2. Create a source tree with a path to \"/Volumes/Zonic Data/Development/Companies/Feral/Libraries\".\r\n\r\n3. Shrink the Display Name and Setting Name column so that the entire path is visible.\r\n\r\n4. Resize the window to be 1 pixel wider.\r\n\r\nAfter resizing the window, the Display Name and Setting Name columns will reset to their original sizes - pushing the source tree path beyond the edge of the window.\r\n\r\nThe columns should ideally retain their sizes (would require a horizontal scroll bar), or attempt to retain their relative proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n'System Profile.txt.zip' was successfully uploaded"
