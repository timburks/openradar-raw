    description: "10-Apr-2011 01:37 PM Zach Drayer:\r\nSummary:\r\nWith the release of Xcode 4, the importance of Xcode 3 has likely decreased. It would be nice if Xcode 3 could be open sourced and turned into a community-driven project. Apple wouldn't even need to provide anything beyond the initial code dump (under a nice license such as Apple's own APSL or another, such as Apache 2, a new or simplified BSD or MIT license).\r\n\r\nThis would be nice because while Xcode 4 is important to Apple and is likely the future, not everyone is completely happy with the direction that it seems to be going in. It would be a nice way to make those people happy without completely ignoring them."
