    description: "01-Apr-2011 04:44 PM Jonathan Crooke:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nEditing a source code file in the text editor can sometimes cause a kind of collapse, whereby the section being edited becomes inaccessible until the editor is exited (another file opened) and previous file re-opened\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEdit source code file in main editor, particularly when edited a few levels deep of scope\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEditing should be not be impinged\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOccasionally, editing a scope can cause the section being edited to seemingly collapse, in a way that appears related to the normally available cold folding feature, but causes the section being edited to become inaccessible. A picture of the effect is attached\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
