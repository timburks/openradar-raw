    description: "15-Mar-2007 07:38 AM Dair Grant:\r\nSearchKit indices appear to be platform-specific, since an index file generated on Mac OS X 10.4 can not be opened on Mac OS X 10.3 (indices generated on 10.3 can be read correctly on 10.4).\r\n\r\nThis restriction is not mentioned in the headers or documentation, and so SK can not be used as a stable index format for storing indices - we have to assume the format may change on any OS release.\r\n\r\nTo make SK more useful as a general indexing API, I would like to request that this restriction be documented (ideally the format would not change again, but if it does the documentation should identify exactly when it does).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful for applications to be able to create indices in an older format (allowing us to, e.g., create 10.3 compatible indices on a 10.4 machine).\r\n\r\nThis could be done with SKIndexType, by making the existing kSKIndexXXX be kSKIndexCurrentXXX and introduce additional kSKIndex10_3_XXX/kSKIndex10_4_XXX/kSKIndex10_5_XXX constants.\r\n\r\nOr by changing the \"inAnalaysisProperties\" parameter to be an \"inIndexProperties\" parameter, that could include both the analysis properties and general index properties such as a file format."
