    description: "100 UDIDs per year has always been a bit frustrating, but it has become a major problem since the iPad was introduced. Most of my beta testers have 2 or even 3 devices now, and the majority of them upgrade every year. I also have a sizable collection of my own devices I use. And of course, sometimes a device has problems which usually means it gets replaced. This results in a fairly small number of beta testers total.\r\n\r\nI imagine this is less of a problem at a larger company where you might have a large number of dedicated beta testers, where you're getting more out of each one. For an indie company that's just not possible. Most of my testers are volunteers. They don't always have time to test thoroughly. Over time they may lose interest in testing and I have to get someone else to replace them. Or I may have someone whose help I need with a particular issue but can't devote the time to test long term. Any time this happens I lose valuable slots for most of the year.\r\n\r\nYet another problem I'm dealing with right now is multiple apps. When your testers are volunteers they're not necessarily going to want to test all of your apps.\r\n\r\nI've suggested in the past that it would work out a lot better for developers if we were authorizing iTunes accounts, rather than devices. A yearly limit on iTunes accounts would be much less of an issue. Perhaps a higher limit could also still be placed on UDIDs, to ensure no one's abusing the systemâ€”and it would be in developer's own interests to weed out testers trying to do this.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility might be to reward long time developers. Increase our limit every year, perhaps. (You could require a certain minimum of app sales to get the increase.) If a developer has been making money off the App Store for a while, surely he's much less likely to abuse the system, because he has far more to lose if his account is shut down."
