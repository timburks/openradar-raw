    description: "There are a number of text fields in Xcode which are primarily used for entering code, and would benefit from some code editor-like features. The most obvious examples are the search and replace fields. The behaviours that interest me personally are:\r\n* Double-click-to-select should have the same behaviour as in a text editor. In particular, words separated by dots should be considered separate units, and double-clicking parentheses should select the contents of balanced pairs.\r\n* Control-arrow-keys should move to the next/previous sub-word boundary."
