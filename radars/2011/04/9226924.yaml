    description: "03-Apr-2011 08:51 AM Anner van Hardenbroek:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you record some audio using the great voice memo app, and you set it as \"Interview\", the audio won't be synced back to iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Record some audio.\r\n2. Go in the details of the recording.\r\n3. Select the label table view cell.\r\n4. Change it the label from \"None\" to \"Interview\".\r\n5. Go to the homescreen.\r\n6. Sync with iTunes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSynced audio file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing is synced.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFirst of all, I consider this a bug, not a feature, because it can lead to data loss. My model, firmware and iTunes combination is not the only place where I encountered this bug. When the same steps are followed it won't work on a iPhone 4 either."
