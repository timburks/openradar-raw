    description: "27-Mar-2011 10:21 PM Marc Hoyois:\r\nSummary:\r\nAn SVG file within a Safari extension is handled as if it were served with MIME type text/html, which makes it impossible to use as a CSS background-image, or to embed in a webpage using <object>, <embed>, <iframe>, or <img>\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Install the attached extension\r\n2) Upon installing, an alert box with a safari-extension:// URL will show up\r\n3) Navigate to that URL, which is a copy of this SVG test page: http://www.schepers.cc/svg/blendups/embedding.html\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe 5 smileys should appear as they do when accessing the above external URL\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nNone of the 5 smileys are displayed: object, embed, and iframe show the smiley as if it were an HTML file, img shows an interrogation mark, and the CSS one does not appear at all\r\n\r\n28-Mar-2011 06:14 PM Marc Hoyois:\r\nThis also prevents the use of SVG fonts with CSS @font-face."
