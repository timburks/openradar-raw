    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing embedded TTF/OTF fonts in an iPhone app, I'm unable to load multiple members of the same family.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAdd 2 fonts from the same family with the same font-weight to an iOS project and add them to UIAppFonts in the associated Info.plist.  Load them with + UIFont fontWithName:size:.\r\n\r\n(I've been using \"Avenir LT Std 35 Light\" and \"Avenir LT Std 45 Book\".)\r\n\r\nUIFont *book = [UIFont fontWithName:@\"AvenirLTStd-Book\" size:12];\r\nUIFont *light = [UIFont fontWithName:@\"AvenirLTStd-Light\" size:12];\r\nNSLog(@\"Book: %@, %@\", book, book.fontName);\r\nNSLog(@\"Light: %@, %@\", light, light.fontName);\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n`book` and `light` should be different objects representing different members of the Avenir family.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBoth `book` and `light` represent the same member of the Avenir family (whichever was listed last in `UIAppFonts`); they even point to the same address.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nBoth \"Light\" and \"Book\" variants show \"font-weight: normal\" in the debug output, despite having different weights (35 vs. 45)."
