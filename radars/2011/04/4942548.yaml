    description: "19-Jan-2007 11:11 PM Dair Grant:\r\nI would like to request some additional icons for Icons.h, to allow Apple to supply high-res versions in preparation for resolution independence:\r\n\r\n - \"General Preferences\" light switch, as per Finder\r\n - \"Advanced Preferences\" gear wheel, as per Finder\r\n - \"Get Info\" blue I, as per Xcode\r\n - \"Software Update\", as per Software Update application\r\n - Blue Magnifying Glass, for Spotlight/SearchKit-powered searches\r\n\r\nAt present we re-draw these icons by hand, which gives us a slightly different appearance from Apple apps and will require us to re-draw them to obtain resolution independence."
