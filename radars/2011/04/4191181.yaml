    description: "23-Jul-2005 12:11 PM Dair Grant:\r\nThe bevel button control content can be specified with a ControlButtonContentInfo, which allows CGImageRef content (e.g., an image loaded from the app bundle) to be assigned to it.\r\n\r\nIB only supports assigning a resource-stored image to a bevel button, but given that resource forks are deprecated we would like this to be extended to support bundle-based images.\r\n\r\nE.g., by allowing IB to assign a bundle-relative path to an image, which would be imported and converted to a CGImageRef, and then assigned to the button."
