    description: "The limit of 100 devices that renew once a year is not sufficient for serious iOS development work. The devices allocated in our portal rapidly begins to fill by just accounting for the number of devices each developer has for testing and development. We also keep many company owned devices for testing older versions of the OS because of the difficultly in downgrading to older versions of the OS.\r\n\r\nThe rest of our slots are quickly filled with good beta testers for our own products and clients that we build applications for. \r\n\r\nThe solution of tracking individuals instead of devices as suggested in rdar://9255432 seems like a great idea. A larger device cap would also be an acceptable alternative."
