    description: "02-Mar-2005 05:40 PM Dair Grant:\r\nWe use environment variables to configure source trees, which library files are then located relative to.\r\n\r\nWhen linking on a machine where the environment variable is not defined, the error from ld simply indicates that the library file could not be found (since the path passed to ld after expanding the missing environment variable is missing the relevant section).\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if the build output window indicated when an undefined environment variable was passed to a command line tool, to indicate that the results are probably not what the project expects (in our case it prevented the build from succeeding, in other cases it may cause other side effects - e.g., finding files in the wrong location).\r\n\r\n\r\n'System Profile.spx.zip' was successfully uploaded"
