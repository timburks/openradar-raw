    description: "05-Apr-2011 07:34 PM Derek Poon:\r\nSummary: When typing the name of a photo's location into the information dialog for a photo, letters can appear twice\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\niPhoto '09 on Mac OS X 10.6.7.\r\nClick on the (i) icon for a photo to bring up the dark gray modal dialog pane.\r\nClick on the \"photo place\" text field.\r\nStart typing the name of a location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text field should contain what the user typed, with possible autocompletion.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe typed letter appears twice.  Typing 's' causes 'ss' to appear, with suggested autocompletions for place names beginning in 'ss'.  Subsequently typed letters appear just once; however, if you hit Backspace, the next letter typed will also appear twice.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDunno.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe bug can happen when the Places list is corrupted, where one of the places lacks locality (city / country) information.  Typing a place name with the same initial letter as the corrupted place will trigger the bug.  If you delete the offending places from Manage My Places, that fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nTo find the offending places to remove, run the command\r\n\r\n$ sqlite3 ~/Pictures/iPhoto\\ Library/iPhotoMain.db \"SELECT name FROM SqUserPlace WHERE description IS NULL;\"\r\n\r\nI suspect that the locality information may be null if the geolocation service was not working when the marker was placed on the map."
