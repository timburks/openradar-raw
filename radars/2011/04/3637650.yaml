    description: "29-Apr-2004 11:26 AM Dair Grant:\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode 1.2 does not provide a folder selector for creating source trees, and uses a text entry field.\r\n\r\nThis is handy for some situations (e.g., performing the same change to several paths), but as these are created by picking something in the file system a \"Choose Folder...\" button should be provided to allow selection through a normal Mac UI process.\r\n\r\n\r\n'System Profile.txt.zip' was successfully uploaded"
