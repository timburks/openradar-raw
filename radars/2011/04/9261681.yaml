    description: "Summary: If one opens a PDF that has editable fields (many application forms are distributed like this today) using Safari's built in PDF viewer, fills in the editable fields and saves the document, the document that is saves will not contain the entered information, leading to the loss of potentially hours of work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a PDF with editable fields (I used the form at http://www.csc.mrc.ac.uk/d/file/pdf/Undergraduate%20Application_2011.pdf).\r\n- Fill in some of the fields\r\n- Save the document using the save shortcut or the HUD \"download\" button.\r\n- Open the document that has been saved to your hard drive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The document contains the fields that you have filled in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The document contains no filled in fields, and is as it was when you first opened the document. This can lead to hours of lost work (hence why I think it's a serious bug).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis also occurs when opening a local PDF file or files on the Internet with Safari.\r\nI haven't tried replicating this with different PDF documents, just the example referred to above."
