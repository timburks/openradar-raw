    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode 4 deletes .svn subdirectory when updating mapping model bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a CoreData based project.\r\n2. Add a new version of the model.\r\n3. Add a mapping model.\r\n4. Put everything under source control using SVN.\r\n5. Update mapping model and save it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSame behavior as Xcode 3 which is to not delete .svn subdirectory of mapping model bundle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode 4 just overwrites mapping model bundle directory or deletes .svn subdirectory. Observe that mapping model now displays with SVN ~ status which is that the \"versioned item obstructed by some item of a different kind\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUsed to work in Xcode 3."
