    description: "28-Mar-2005 01:48 AM Dair Grant:\r\nA technique we use, which is extremely successful in spotting trivial bugs, is to always step through new code at least once in the debugger before checking it in.\r\n\r\nThis encourages you to regularly commit incrementally-safe changes, and to observe the code at least once in conjunction with actual data (vs simply reading the code as you write it).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best UI for expressing this would be (colour tint appropriate source lines?), but I would love it if Xcode could automatically show which lines have been stepped through and which have not.\r\n\r\nThis would make this process much more obvious, as it would allow you to instantly spot code which has never been observed to have been run vs code you have confirmed is valid (for the data you saw it with).\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously this isn't fool-proof (you may only observe one particular set of data, and fail to observe the cases which fail), but like fix-and-continue it catches a large number of \"how could I not have noticed that\" situations where the code compiles OK but has an obvious logic error when combined with real data.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure how you would distinguish old code vs new code, as on multi-person projects you will end up checking out code you didn't write (and so should assume someone else has verified).\r\n\r\nIdeally the state would track any code you typed, so \"merge\" changes from external sources (due to check-outs or other editors) automatically with code typed into Xcode. Given this merged state (everything external is safe, everything I typed needs to be verified), the debugger/editor could indicate which lines you had authored but not yet inspected.\r\n\r\nThere would probably need to be a per-file indicator within the project window, so you could easily scan the project and see which files contained non-verified code before deciding to check anything in."
