    description: "20-Apr-2006 08:40 AM Dair Grant:\r\nTo drag colors between applications, or between the Cocoa color picker and a Carbon application, developers need to check the pasteboard for a dynamically-defined type:\r\n\r\n    cfValue = UTTypeCreatePreferredIdentifierForTag(kUTTagClassNSPboardType,\r\n                                                            (CFStringRef) NSColorPboardType, NULL);\r\n\r\nAnd then re-cast the pasteboard type to an NSColor:\r\n\r\n    nsPboardFlavorType = UTTypeCopyPreferredTagWithClass(flavorType,\r\n                                                                   kUTTagClassNSPboardType );\r\n\r\n    if (nsPboardFlavorType == NSColorPboardType)\r\n         theColor = [NSColor colorFromPasteboard:NSDragPboard];\r\n\r\nSince the basic color reference on the system should be a CGColorRef, and not a color object from one of the application frameworks, I would like to request a kUTTypeCGColor type:\r\n\r\n  /*\r\n   *  kUTTypeCGColor\r\n   *\r\n   *    Opaque CGColorRef data\r\n   *\r\n   *    UTI: com.apple.coregraphics.color\r\n   *    conforms to: public.data\r\n   */\r\n\r\nThe Cocoa color picker should place one of these on the pasteboard along with its NSColor and legacy NXColor types, and applications could receive a color reference via a drag without needing to look for a dynamic type/re-cast that type to obtain the NSPasteboard flavor."
