    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Xcode 4 and Xcode 3 are both installed, double-clicking an Xcode project in Xcode 3 opens it in Xcode 4 by default.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new project in Xcode 3, A.xcodeproj.\r\n* Create a second project, B.xcodeproj.\r\n* Add B.xcodeproj to the group and file hierarchy of A.xcodeproj.\r\n* Close B.xcodeproj.\r\n* In the Groups & Files list of A.xcodeproj, double-click B.xcodeproj.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* The project should open in Xcode 3, the desired result in 100Â % of cases. (By working in Xcode 3, I have clearly signalled my intent to work in Xcode 3.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* The project opens in Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSituation could not arise with multiple versions of Xcode 3 as they had the same bundle identifier and were correctly treated as two versions of the same application by launch services.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs of Mac OS X 10.6.7, it is apparently impossible to change the default binding for Xcode projects from Xcode 4 to Xcode 3, so this situation must be fixed on a case-by-case basis."
