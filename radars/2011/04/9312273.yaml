    description: When an App receives a notification, it should be moved to the top of the multitasking UI. That way, if the user does not respond to the notification before the screen is locked, gets another notification from another app before they can respond, or chooses to do one more thing before viewing the notification, they can double tap the home button to go directly to the app that notified them. This would also let users check the badges of recently notified apps.
