    description: "06-Jun-2007 09:43 PM Dair Grant:\r\nTXNSetActionNameMapper appears to have no affect on 10.4.9.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this, open the /Developer/Examples/Carbon/MLTEShowcase project and set a break in:\r\n\r\n  * TextViewAddActionNameMapper\r\n  * MyActionNameMapperCallback\r\n\r\nBoth of which are in TextView.cpp. Confirm that TextViewAddActionNameMapper returns noErr, and then open the Edit menu after performing some undoable actions.\r\n\r\nAt this point MyActionNameMapperCallback should be called back to update the items in the menu; however it is never called.\r\n\r\n\r\nI experience this problem in my own app, where I have two windows A and B.\r\n\r\nA contains an image editing view, and updates the undo item to a disabled \"Can't Undo\" when nothing can be undone. B contains an HITextView, which has an ActionNameMapper callback that is never called (instead MLTE appears to just update the enabled/disabled state of the menu item).\r\n\r\nThis means that if the Edit menu is invoked on window A when nothing can be undone, the menu item is set to \"Can't Undo\". If window B is then brought to the front and an undoable action performed, the Edit menu will contain an enabled item that reads \"Can't Undo\" (i.e., the HITextView enabled the kHICommandUndo menu item, but didn't call the ActionMapper to obtain the correct text/didn't reset the text to \"Undo\")."
