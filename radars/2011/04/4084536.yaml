    description: "10-Apr-2005 10:36 AM Dair Grant:\r\nWe have a window containing two pop-up menus, which are linked such that selecting an item from the first menu may programatically change the contents of the second menu.\r\n\r\nWhen the contents of the second menu are changed, we do so with SetMenuItemCommandID and SetMenuItemTextWithCFString. This all works as expected, except when the item being changed is also the currently selected item in the secondary menu.\r\n\r\nWhen this is the case, the menu is updated - however the control is not redrawn, and must be explicitly invalidated for the new value to be visible.\r\n\r\nAs the menu will redraw automatically when the user clicks in it, we would like the control to invalidate itself automatically when the appearance of the currently-selected item changes."
