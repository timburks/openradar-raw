    description: "Summary:\r\nIn some cases, pressing the space bar in the iTunes main window will play a different song than the one that's displayed in the toolbar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Start playing a song (\"Song A\") in the iTunes main window.\r\n2) Open a second window by double clicking on a playlist.\r\n3) Start playing a second song (\"Song B\") in the second window and pause it. Now both the main window and the second window display Song B.\r\n4) Press the play button in the main window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe song which is displayed in the main window's toolbar continues playing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSong A (which is *not* one that was displayed in the toolbar) starts playing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne possible way to solve this problem:\r\nWhen a song is playing in the second window: Show this in the main window as well to avoid confusion.\r\nWhen a song is paused in the second window: Just show the ï£¿ logo in the main window because for most purposes (except pressing the play/pause button (F8) on the keyboard) the main window now behaves as if no song were playing or paused at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated on 05-Dec-2011:\r\n\"We are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue and will continue to track it.\"\r\nState: Behaves correctly"
