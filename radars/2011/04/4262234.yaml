    description: "17-Sep-2005 05:55 PM Dair Grant:\r\nWe have a project that builds a bundle, which is then processed by a shell script invoked by a Run Script build phase.\r\n\r\nThis processing involves manipulating the binary produced by the build, and so must happen as the last possible step in the build process.\r\n\r\nIf we define EXPORTED_SYMBOLS_FILE, the \"EditSymbols\" build phase happens after any Run Script build phases are invoked - we would like more control over this ordering, so that we can run scripts either before or after this phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally the Targets tab for the project would look something like:\r\n\r\nTargets/\r\n  NameOfTarget/\r\n    Dependencies/\r\n      <<dependencies appear here rather than under NameOfTarget>>\r\n    Build/\r\n      <<all build phases appear here>>\r\n\r\nThe Build section should display every stage within the build process (including otherwise invisible stages such as EditSymbols, RanLib, etc that are invoked depending on the target settings).\r\n\r\nIDE-required stages would have a fixed order (can't link before you can compile), however user-added stages (or at least shell scripts) could be placed at any point in the sequence.\r\n\r\nIf IDE-required vs user-added stages had a distinct appearance, this would help make it clearer which stages were required by virtue of the target type/settings and which were custom steps."
