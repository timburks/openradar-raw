    description: "Maintaining backwards compatibility is very hard because iOS can't be downgraded. We already have 6 iOS devices in our test pool and that is still not sufficient because we can't downgrade the OS. For example, we have to test specifically against the iPhone 3GS on both iOS 3.x and iOS 4.0-4.3.\r\n\r\nWe already had two cases of urgent App Store updates just because of this lack of a downgrading option.\r\n\r\nWe certainly acknowledge the general policy to not allow downgrading (although we see it mainly as an anti-jailbreak measure). However, it would be great to exempt developers from that policy."
