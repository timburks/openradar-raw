    description: "23-Jul-2005 12:19 PM Dair Grant:\r\nHIGrowBoxViewSetTransparent can be used to set the transparency flag for the grow box in a Carbon WindowRef, however Interface Builder provides no way to set this flag.\r\n\r\nIB should offer this option in the Window Inspector palette (although strictly speaking it's a feature of the grow box view, the Window Inspector is the only place the grow box visibility can be controlled so that's probably the right home for this too)."
