    description: "ummary:\r\nSafari: Geolocation Position timestamp is incorrect according to W3C Spec\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached geolocation.html file (the code is in it)\r\n2. Press the \"Get Location\" button\r\n3. Note the Position timestamp value\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Position timestamp value should be in milliseconds, and based off the Unix epoch of Jan 1, 1970. This is the value based on the W3C Geolocation Spec. http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html\r\nMobile Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox 4 all exhibit this expected behaviour, while Desktop Safari is the odd man out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Position timestamp value is in seconds, and based off the reference date of Jan 1, 2001.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
