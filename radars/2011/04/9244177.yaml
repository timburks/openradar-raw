    description: "Summary: When using aperture 3.1.2 (and all previous versions of the software) on OS X 10.6 to upload photos to Facebook and Flickr, it behaves unreliably. Specifically, it will not upload all of the photos at once, requiring you to click on the \"synchronise\" button several times before all of the photos have been uploaded. It is also often the case that some of the photos have been duplicated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an album in Aperture containing photos.\r\n- Select all of the photos and click on either the Flickr or Facebook button and either create a new album, or add to an existing one.\r\n- Note that after Aperture reports that the photos have been uploaded, inspection of the album reveals that not all of them have.\r\n- Click on the \"synchronise\" button for the online album in Aperture until all of the photos have been uploaded.\r\n- Note that there are probably now duplicates of some photos in the online version of the album.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The upload should not finish until all of the photos have been uploaded.\r\n- The uploader should not duplicate images.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The uploaded stop before all images have been uploaded, you must press \"synchronise\" several times to make all of them upload.\r\n- The uploader, after having pressed \"synchronise\" several times, will duplicate some images in the web version of the album (but not the version represented in Aperture).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI did not notice this problem for a while after purchasing Aperture 3.0, so this may be a regression since that point. It may also be that I just missed the problem initially.\r\n\r\nNotes: Around 10% of the comments on my Facebook photos are \"this photo appears n times!\" (where n is an integer greater than 1)."
