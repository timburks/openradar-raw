    description: "Summary:\r\nWith no Bluetooth device connected (as indicated by the status bar icon, and the Bluetooth settings page) EAAccessoryManager returns an EAAccessory object for a Bluetooth device that was previously connected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf no Bluetooth device is connected, [[EAAccessoryManager sharedManager] connectedAccessories] should not return an EAAccessory instance for a previously-connected Bluetooth accessory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n[[EAAccessoryManager sharedManager] connectedAccessories] sometimes returns an EAAccessory instance representing a previously-connected (but no-longer connected) Bluetooth accessory.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\niPod touch (4th generation)\r\niOS 4.3.1 (8G4)\r\n\r\nPossibly encountered on iPhone 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHere are the steps that I've gone through to diagnose the issue when it happens. I have done this with an app we are developing and with EADemo:\r\n\r\nI killed the app from the background and relaunched it: same result\r\nI viewed the Bluetooth settings page. It showed \"LARK-1F4F Not Connected\". I relaunched the app: same result\r\nI turned Bluetooth off and then relaunched the app: same result\r\nI turned Bluetooth back on and relaunched the app: same result\r\nI forgot the Bluetooth device and relaunched the app: same result\r\nI powered off and rebooted the iPod touch and then relaunched the app: fixed the problem\r\nThese results hold for both the LARK app and for EADemo.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, according to a report from a beta tester (who uses an iPhone 4) who may have encountered the issue, reconnecting the Bluetooth accessory may have solved the issue.\r\n\r\nI do not know how to reproduce this issue. However, it recently happened after 40 to 50 hours of not using the iPod touch (4th generation) that I use for development."
