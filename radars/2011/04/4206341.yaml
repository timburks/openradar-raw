    description: "05-Aug-2005 11:25 AM Dair Grant:\r\nI have noticed several apps (attached is a screenshot from VoodooPad), where a window has inadvertently had the resize attribute left on (particularly problematic for sheet windows, where resizing often makes no sense).\r\n\r\nOne of the main causes of this is that IB always displays the grow box in a window when editing, even if the window has the \"Resizeable\" attribute turned off.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask that IB show/hide the grow box based on the resizeable attribute state, and if the grow box is hidden still allow developers to resize windows if the bottom right corner is dragged.\r\n\r\nThis would solve the problem the current behaviour is presumably intended to help with (to show developers that they can resize any window during nib construction), while reducing the chances that people stop noticing the \"resizeable\" checkbox state (given that it makes no difference to the appearance or behaviour of a window within IB).\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 1.jpg' was successfully uploaded"
