    description: "27-Apr-2011 10:57 AM Colin Mcfadden:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWe serve podcasts+media from a cluster of Xserves.  Since iTunes 10.2.2 shipped, we've noticed servers dropping offline periodically.  We've correlated this to iTunes clients refreshing podcast feeds.  It seems that iTunes is hitting every item in the feed, multiple times, simultaneously.  I've occasionally been able to get iTunes to do this by subscribing to a podcast, quitting, and then relaunching iTunes.  All of the \"Bad\" traffic has an AppleCoreMedia user agent, while all of the \"Good\" traffic (the connections actually performing the downloads seen in the iTunes UI) have an iTunes user agent.\r\n\r\nI've attached an excerpt of an apache log showing the type of traffic being generated by a single student launching iTunes.  Since all of these loads involve a database call and pull files off Xsan, you can imagine how a few students doing this can essentially trash a server - it causes the 10.5.8 network stack to hang for 5+ minutes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDifficult to reproduce consistently.  As mentioned above, I've had the best luck subscribing to a feed, then quitting mid-download, then relaunching iTunes.  I've also noticed that just clicking on undownloaded podcast items in iTunes generates a fair number of requests to the server, though just for the file that's being highlighted, not for every item in the feed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFiles loaded\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBusted server\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt *appears* to have started since the release of 10.2.2.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
