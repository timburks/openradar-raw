    description: "SUMMARY:\r\nBefore sending out an event, iCal should parse the title to see if the event is scheduled for a reasonable timeframe. For example, if the event originator creates a lunch event at 12 AM (midnight), iCal should ask the user if they *actually* want to schedule the meeting for 12 PM, thus, preventing the event originator from looking like an idiot.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Create a lunch event\r\n2. Set the time (erroneously) to 12 AM\r\n3. Add event participants\r\n4. Save the event\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\niCal displays a notification to warn the user that they are about to schedule an event at a ridiculous time.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nThe event participants make fun of the event originator for scheduling an event at a ridiculous time."
