    description: "14-Jun-2005 12:06 PM Dair Grant:\r\nUsing Xcode 2.1, create a new Carbon Application project. I see the following behaviour with the Build Status column within the project window.\r\n\r\n1. Build the project, click the hammer column - the tick flicks on and then reverts off. Hitting Build again does not rebuild the file, since presumably the file was not marked as dirty (hence the tick turning off).\r\n\r\nThe CW->Xcode document says that clicking in this column \"will touch or untouch a file, causing it to be rebuilt (or ignored) during the next rebuild\", but this does not appear to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Modify a file (e.g., main.c), save it, then move the selection within the project window to another file and build.\r\n\r\nThe modified file will have a tick against it before the build, and will still be ticked after the build (even though it is no longer dirty). If the file is selected while the build occurs, or the project window is refreshed (e.g., by switching tabs), then the tick is correctly removed when the build is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Modify a file, then build before saving the file. In CW, modifying the file in memory will mark it as dirty even if the file is not saved - the version of the file which is compiled is the one in the open window, whereas Xcode requires that the file be saved to disk first.\r\n\r\nI would prefer it if modifying a file marked the file as dirty from the point of view of the build system, such that the modified file (even if unsaved) would be used for compilation.\r\n\r\n04-Jul-2005 12:43 AM Dair Grant:\r\nFor item 1, this may be caused by having source that's up-and-over from the project file. Our projects are always organised as:\r\n\r\n  MyApp/\r\n    Development/\r\n      Project/\r\n        MyApp.xcodeproj\r\n      Source/\r\n        MyApp.cpp\r\n        MyApp.h\r\n      Resources/\r\n        Info.plist\r\n        MyApp.nib\r\n\r\nAnd I believe having this kind of structure affects the ability of the hammer column to touch/untouch source files."
