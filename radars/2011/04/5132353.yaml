    description: "13-Apr-2007 10:29 AM Dair Grant:\r\nNSSpellChecker uses two protocols (NSChangeSpelling and NSIgnoreMispelledWords) to communicate user commands back to the text being spell checked.\r\n\r\nThese messages are dispatched to the Cocoa responder chain, which makes this object difficult to use from within a Carbon application (or a Cocoa object wishing to spell check something which isn't in the responder chain).\r\n\r\nTo properly separate NSSpellChecker from the object being examined, it should use a delegate to handle these protocols rather than targeting the responder chain directly."
