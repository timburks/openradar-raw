    description: "Summary:\r\nYou are unable to use keyboard shortcuts to insert superscript or subscript text into text boxes (that is, any text entry field outside of the main view of your tables) in Numbers '09. This has two effects:\r\n- It is impossible to include superscript or subscript text in the table title and other components that can only be modified through the inspector, making users feel Numbers is not powerful enough to format titles as they wish.\r\n- It is inconsistent, frustrating users when a keyboard shortcut works sometimes but not others.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Create a new table in numbers\r\n- Open up the inspector\r\n- Attempt to use the ctrl-cmd+ or ctrl-cmd-- shortcuts to add superscript or subscript text to the title of the table through the inspector\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n- The text of the title becomes superscript as would occur when editing the contents of a cell with the cursor positioned inside the cell.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n- No superscript text appears\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- You are able to include superscript text when editing a cell inside the main table view.\r\n- Anecdotally, I can't recall a situation where this superscript entry inconstancy has /not/ occurred in other apps.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- You're probably using an NSAttributedString behind the scenes anyway, and I'd be amazed if your rendering of the title did not support string attributes. You may only have to facilitate the user of the superscript shortcuts for the text entry field."
