    description: "24-Aug-2005 12:29 PM Dair Grant:\r\nWhen creating a Carbon HISegmentedView with InterfaceBuilder, the initial value of the control appears to be set to the maximum segment.\r\n\r\nI.e., if you create a HISegmentedView with three segments, the third segment will be blue in IB and will be blue at runtime - the current value of the control needs to be explicitly set in code if some other segment is required.\r\n\r\nThe inspector for this control should provide a \"Current Value\" field for editing the current value associated with the control (e.g., as per the slider control, although min/max would not be necessary)."
