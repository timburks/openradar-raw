    description: "Summary: The \"Validate\" step in the Xcode 4 organizer passes for an app which when submitted, immediately fails a code signing check.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Here is the email I received from the iTunes Store. Create an invalid submission that would trigger this message and run Xcode 4 validation.\r\n\r\n================\r\nDear Developer,\r\n\r\nThank you for your recent binary submission for \"My Radtastical App\" to the App Store. Unfortunately we discovered an issue with your binary that you will need to correct in order for your application to proceed to the review stage. The specific issue is outlined below:\r\n\r\nInvalid Signature - Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate. Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level (which override any values at the project level). Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target. If you are certain your code signing settings are correct, choose \"Clean All\" in Xcode, delete the \"build\" directory in the Finder, and rebuild your release target.\r\n\r\nOnce you have corrected the issue, please return to the application's version details page in the iTunes Connect Manage Your Applications module and click on the Ready to Submit Binary button. This will take you through the binary submission flow and return your application version status to Waiting for Upload. You can then use Application Loader to upload your new binary. If any other issues are found with your submission you will be contacted.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nThe iTunes Connect Team\r\n\r\n================\r\n\r\nExpected Results: When something \"validates\" it should be valid. The check being performed on the server should be migrated to the Xcode 4 validation or better yet, it should be made unnecessary by constraining Xcode 4 to not produce invalid products.\r\n\r\nActual Results: See the summary.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: Thank you."
