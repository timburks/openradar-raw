    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Unicode code points U+2308 to U+230B represent the mathematical notation for the ceiling and floor functions: ⌈x⌉ and ⌊x⌋.\r\n\r\nTheir correct rendition can be seen in, for example, TeX renderings on the Wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions . There is also a helpful note in the Unicode Standard (http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf): “These characters are tall and narrow mathematical delimiters, in contrast to the quine corners or half brackets. They are also distinct from CJK corner brackets, which are wide quotation marks.”\r\n\r\nHowever, several Mac OS X system fonts have incorrect glyphs for these code points; they are similar to the heavy box drawing corner glyphs U+250F U+2513, U+2517 and U+251B (┏, ┓, ┗, ┛). Most significantly, this includes Heiti SC Light, which (for some unfathomable reason) is used as the fallback font for these glyphs. This means that random text using these symbols – such as the aforementioned Wikipedia page – look wrong.\r\n\r\nThe complete list of affected system fonts is:\r\nHeiti SC Light\r\nHeiti SC Medium\r\nHeiti TC Light\r\nSTFangSong Regular\r\nSTHeiti Light\r\nSTHeiti Regular\r\nSTKaiti Regular\r\nSTSong Regular\r\n\r\nApple Symbols Regular has a different error with these glyphs: they are too low, being limited to about x-height.\r\n\r\nMenlo Regular has correct floor and ceiling glyphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn a Mac without exotic fonts installed, copy this bug report into TextEdit and set the font to Helvetica.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first sentence should contain the letter x with ceiling and floor brackets. (Changing the font to Menlo achieves this.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first sentence contains the letter x waving its arms up and down.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown; not tested on earlier systems."
