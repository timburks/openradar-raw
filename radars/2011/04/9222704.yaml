    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXCode allows you to set the minimum deployment target for an iPhone or Mac app. However, it doesn't warn or prevent you from using API methods that are not available in that OS version, even though OS availability is there in the NS_AVAILABLE macros. Please add a warning when using methods introduced after the minimum deployment target.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an XCode project and set the deployment target to 3.1.2. Add a call to NSSet's sortedArrayUsingDescriptors: method, which is only available after iOS 4.0. The attached XCode project does this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA warning that the method is not available on the deployment target.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app crashes when the method is executed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis problem is exacerbated by the difficulty of acquiring iOS devices with earlier OS versions, or downgrading existing devices. I have an app that supports down to 3.1.2, and I frequently end up using API methods that aren't available on that OS version, because it's not obvious unless I look up the header doc every time I call an API method. I always test on a 3.1.2 device before submitting an update, and have to refactor the code to work around those calls. The only easy way to discover the offending calls is to let the app crash in the debugger, which makes it easy to miss specific code paths. It's also harder to refactor at that time then when initially writing the code--warnings in the IDE would vastly help."
