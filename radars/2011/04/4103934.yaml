    description: "30-Apr-2005 05:13 PM Dair Grant:\r\nUsing Xcode 2.0, declare a local variable to be a DES_cblock. In the debugger, right-click and select \"View as memory\".\r\n\r\nThis type is 8 bytes, however by default the viewer will display 512 bytes with the \"Word Size\" pop-up set to 4. Select the \"512\", type \"8\", and hit return. The \"8\" will be changed to a 16, and 16 bytes will be displayed rather than 8.\r\n\r\nTo display the correct number of bytes, the Word Size pop-up must be changed to 2 before the byte count is changed. It looks like the number of bytes that is displayed is rounded up to the Word Size pop-up, however this is not ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would prefer if the Bytes and Word Size controls were decoupled, so that they did exactly what they said - showed N bytes, in groups of M. So far I have found two situations where I would prefer this behaviour:\r\n\r\n- I would like to be able to look at structures smaller than the current word size, so that I could view an 8-byte structure as two 4-byte words rather four 2-byte words.\r\n\r\n- I would like to be able to look at structures that are an odd number of bytes (3, 7, 9, etc) and not have them rounded up to the Word Size multiple.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other changes that would make this window more useful are:\r\n\r\n- Wrap on the word size multiple, not on the 8-size width. To see this, arrange the window so that it displays two columns of 8-byte words, then switch to smaller sized words.\r\n\r\nThe smaller words will be wrapped prematurely, when really I want to see 2-byte quantities for as wide as I've made the window (not \"as wide as you've made the window if you were using 8-byte words\").\r\n\r\n- The window does not have a title, and does not appear in the Windows menu.\r\n\r\n- Clamp the size of the left column to an address or nothing. You can currently shrink it to display half a character, or wrap a single address into a single column of text.\r\n\r\n- Lose the Column pop-up. It is only accurate if the entire range of data will fit in the window (look at 128 bytes in 2-byte groups with 32 columns; unless your window is the width of the screen, your \"columns\" will wrap before you get to 32 and it's hard to see what's a column and what's just wrapping).\r\n\r\n- Indicate which bytes have just been modified, as per CodeWarrior (doing so after a step, not when the window is selected).\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally this window would function exactly like the memory display window in CodeWarrior.\r\n\r\nI.e., a column of addresses down the side that reflect the first byte in each row, bytes can be grouped by some given word size, some given number of bytes will be shown in total, and groups of bytes fill the entire width of the window until the byte count is reached."
