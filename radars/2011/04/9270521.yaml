    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the \"View Changes\" sheet of a commit in the \"Repositories\" tab of the organizer, it is possible to make edits to both versions, shown in the diff. These changes, however, are impossible to persist: Hitting command-s shortly highlights the \"File\"-menu, but the file is saved to some temporary location — completely opaque and non-retrievable to the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a commit from a repository in the Organizer, click the disclosure triangle next to the commit hash and hit the \"View Changes\" button.\r\n2. Within the diff, start typing (either old or new version works, it doesn't matter).\r\n3. Hit command-s or go to \"File\" > \"Save\"; you are left with the impression that your changes are saved in am obvious kind of way...\r\n4. Hit command-shift-s and see _where_ those changes are actually saved\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSeveral options.\r\nOne would be, to handle each save as a \"Save As...\", with a destination within the project and the name pre-populated as $commitName-review-$fileName.\r\nAnother one would be to prompt for a (temporary?) review-branch (with the option to create a new one), to which these changes should be committed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe merge is saved to a temporary file, in a directory that is not easily discoverable. Furthermore, if you have managed to find the directory containing the merged file, it is impossible to find out what commit this merge belongs to — the prefix in the filename seems to be some completely random string.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nunknown\r\n\r\nNotes:"
