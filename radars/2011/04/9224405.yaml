    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you build an iOS project that has a static library target, as well as an application target that links against the library, it won't archive correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Start a new view based app project.\r\n- Add a Cocoa Touch Static Library.\r\n- Add a new objective-c class with the static library as the target.\r\n- In the iOS app target, under build phases, add the static library to \"Link Binary With Libraries\"\r\n- Set your scheme to the iOS app, with \"iOS device\" as the target.\r\n- Archive the app.\r\n- From selector, attempt to share the archive.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- \"Contents\" defaults to option 1: \"iOS App Store Package (.ipa)\"\r\n- \"Identity\" is \"iPhone Developer\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- Contents option 1 is not selectable. Shows \"Package (No Packager exists for the type of archive)\".\r\n- \"Identity\" is not selectable. Shoes \"This kind of archive cannot be signed\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWorks fine in Xcode 3.x.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf you remove the library dependency from the app, it archives correctly."
