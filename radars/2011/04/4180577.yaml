    description: "14-Jul-2005 11:14 AM Dair Grant:\r\nCreate a new project in Condensed view, expand the Sources group, and select a source file (e.g., main.c). Double-click the \"Groups & Files\" column header, and main.c will be opened - even though it was not double-clicked.\r\n\r\nI frequently run into this when I have some file selected, I try and double-click the blue project icon immediately under Groups & Files, and over-shoot the double-click.\r\n\r\nRather than the project icon opening (what I was trying to hit), or nothing opening (as you'd expect since single-clicking a column header has no effect), some other file (which may be scrolled out of view) is opened instead."
