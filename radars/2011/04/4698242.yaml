    description: "24-Aug-2006 02:12 PM Dair Grant:\r\nHIWebView currently registers for kEventControlBoundsChanged, to keep the NSView bounds in sync when the HIView frame is changed.\r\n\r\nIt should also register for kEventWindowBoundsChanged, or a change to the window size that does not change the control size (e.g., where the view is not bound to the window edges) will not keep the NSView in sync.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.g., if a window is resized vertically, an HIView that is not bound to the window top/bottom edges will remain at the same location.\r\n\r\nSince the NSView coordinate system has its origin at the bottom/left of the window, an NSView must adjust its location in order to achieve the same effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a window containing an HIWebView is resized in this manner, the HIView location will remain the same even though the NSView should adapt (but since the HIWebView.m wrapper only invokes SyncFrame on a kEventControlBoundsChanged or kEventControlOwningWindowChanged event, the NSView will go out of sync).\r\n\r\nThe HIWebView.m wrapper should also register for kEventWindowBoundsChanged, and invoke SyncFrame when the window is resized (re-registering its kEventWindowBoundsChanged handler on a kEventControlOwningWindowChanged).\r\n\r\n07-Nov-2006 10:15 AM Dair Grant:\r\nAttached is an app which creates a 600x400 HIWebView which is not bound to the window sides.\r\n\r\nResize the window, and you will experience various redraw glitches due to the NSView not being updated as the window is resized.\r\n\r\n\r\n'NanoWeb.app.zip' was successfully uploaded"
