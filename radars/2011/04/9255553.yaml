    description: "To make sure, developers support features of new Apple hardware as fast as possible, they should be prioritized in getting new Apple hardware.\r\n\r\nParticularly bad is the situation for the iPad 2 where we have to ask our users if everything still works because we still don't have a device in our hands (although we ordered online the 1st hour it became available in Europe).\r\n\r\nDiscounted hardware for developers would be a nice touch, too, but more important is the speedy access."
