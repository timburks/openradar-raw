    description: "Summary:\r\nWith native apps, such as Pages, I can be using the app, switch to my email to check something quickly — When I switch back to Pages, it's in the exact same state it was when I left, and I can resume working immediately.\r\n\r\nI expect web apps saved to the home screen to work the same way. When I switch away from a web app, it has an icon in the multitasking bar like any other app. But when I switch back to it, it has lost its prior state — it has to reload from scratch every single time. This is a huge pain, it's frustrating and a time sink. I use web apps for real work and I expect to be able to switch back and forth without losing state. This is doubly frustrating because this works fine when using an app in MobileSafari — I saved my web app as a home screen icon for *faster* access, using it this way shouldn't slow me down!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) In MobileSafari, load a web app which includes the meta tag \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" with the value \"yes\". Save the app to the home screen, then launch it from the home screen. A good test app is Glyphboard @ http://mrgan.com/gb/\r\n\r\n2) Put the app into a specific state. If using Glyphboard, copy and paste a few characters into the text box at the top of the view.\r\n\r\n3) Use fast switching to switch to a different app\r\n\r\n4) Use fast switching to switch back to Glyphboard. It will start from scratch and return to zero-state, having lost the state it had been in when last using it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should retain state. When switching back to it, it should be in exactly the same state it was in before I switched away.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app starts from scratch and returns to zero-state, having lost the state it had been in when last using it."
