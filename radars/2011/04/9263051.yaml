    description: "11-Apr-2011 10:44 AM Aidan Steele:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Mac App Store provides application developers with a method of preventing unauthorised copies of their application running[1]. This functionality is unavailable on the iOS platform, but would be extremely useful.\r\n\r\nOne use-case where this is a show-stopper is with regards to iOS apps that make use of consumable web services. In-app purchases provide receipts that are cryptographically signed, but there is no way of validating the initial purchase of the app itself. \r\n\r\nThe current implied solution is to create a free app with in-app purchases to access the consumable web service, but this provides a substandard user experience as users expect the app to be usable out-of-the-box. An app purchase receipt (in the style of the MAS) would alleviate this problem in its entirety.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/documents/validating.html"
