    description: "02-Jul-2005 02:58 PM Dair Grant:\r\nAlthough the order is not significant, I would like to be able to drag source trees around to neaten up existing lists. E.g., at present my source trees are:\r\n\r\n  LI_DIR\r\n  Libraries\r\n  Companies\r\n  FeralLibraries\r\n  FeralProducts\r\n  ZonicProducts\r\n  Library\r\n  ZonicLibraries\r\n  ZonicResources\r\n\r\nBecause the paths these source trees point to are quite long, I would like to be able to organise them so that similarly-rooted paths are placed next to each other. As we use a consistent prefix, this would also help us adjust the above so that it read:\r\n\r\n  LI_DIR\r\n  Library\r\n  Libraries\r\n  Companies\r\n  FeralLibraries\r\n  FeralProducts\r\n  ZonicLibraries\r\n  ZonicProducts\r\n  ZonicResources\r\n\r\nThe \"FeralXXX\" and \"ZonicXXX\" sections have an internal meaning for us, and so it's easier to see what trees are set up and where if you can sort them without having to remove then re-add trees."
