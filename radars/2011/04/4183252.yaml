    description: "16-Jul-2005 10:44 AM Dair Grant:\r\nWe use .xcconfig files to standardise settings across projects. Although these files must be parsed prior to doing a build/opening the target settings window, no warning is given if their contents are corrupt (e.g., they do not contain recognisable settings).\r\n\r\nI would like Xcode to validate .xcconfig files when it reads them, to ensure that if it finds a setting which does not correspond to a known option that it emits a warning - we often edit these by hand rather than changing the UI option in an open project and then dragging the item out, but a typo may go unnoticed unless the UI version of the setting is inspected closely.\r\n\r\n10-Aug-2005 11:39 AM Dair Grant:\r\nI received the following from DTS:\r\n\r\n\"Follow-up:  10253864\r\nThis is a follow-up to Bug ID# 4183252.  Please know that our engineers have not been able to reproduce this reported behavior. We do a validation of .xcconfig settings when they are read, and provide an alert in the GUI.  If you have a case where this is not happening, please provide detailed Steps to Reproduce. \"\r\n\r\nAttached is a simple Carbon application project which demonstrates the problem - it includes a screenshot showing what I see in the target options for a target based on a corrupt .xcconfig file.\r\n\r\nThe xcconfig file sets GCC_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS to \"foo\" (legal values are \"default\", \"full\", and \"used\").\r\n\r\nNo warning is given when the project is opened or the target's configuration window is opened. The \"Level of Debug Symbols\" value is blank, and the -g flag is silently omitted from the build.\r\n\r\n\r\n'ConfigTest.zip' was successfully uploaded"
