    description: "27-Apr-2011 03:14 PM\r\n\r\nSummary: When I add a shared scheme to a project that only has the initial (un-shared) default scheme, anyone who clones the repository from that point on only sees the shared scheme. If I make my default scheme shared, anyone who already had a copy of the project gains a duplicate default scheme. There's no way to make everyone happy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n* Create a new Xcode 4 project. Put it in your version control system of choice. \r\n\r\n* Check out a new copy, which we'll call A. A has the auto-generated default scheme.\r\n\r\n* Add a shared scheme to your working copy, which we'll call \"Adhoc\". Commit it.\r\n\r\n* Update A's working copy, which now reflects both A's default scheme and the Adhoc scheme. [A is happy.]\r\n\r\n* Now check out another new copy, call it B. B has only the Adhoc scheme. Pressing the Autogenerate button does nothing. [B is unhappy.]\r\n\r\n* Commit your original shared scheme to version control. \r\n\r\n* Update B's working copy. B now has the default and Adhoc schemes. [B is happy.]\r\n\r\n* Update A's working copy. A now has three schemes, and gets confused until they're instructed to delete their un-shared scheme. [A is unhappy.]\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Adding a shared scheme should not affect the presence or absence of the default, autogenerated scheme.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Adding a shared scheme throws current and future users of the Xcode project into disequilibrium. Either the new users must import a new scheme, or existing users must delete their original scheme."
