    description: "Summary: Static analyzer misses cases where objects referenced in a block are released before the block is copied or invoked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5446187/should-a-block-literal-retain-referenced-heap-allocated-blocks)\r\n\r\nConsider the code:\r\n\r\nNSString *s = [[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"abcd\"] retain];\r\nvoid (^b)(void) = ^{\r\n\tNSLog(@\"s: %@\", s);\r\n};\r\n[s release];\r\n\r\nb_copy = [b copy];\r\nb_copy();\r\n[b_copy release];\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Static analyzer should point out that b_copy might be attempting to copy an object s that has been deallocated.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Static analyzer does not give any warning"
