    description: "06-Sep-2005 12:41 PM Dair Grant:\r\nIf a repeating Carbon Timer is installed with a very high frequency, it will cease to fire. As the timer is repeating it is documented to fire as often as it can - even if it misses slots, it will not stop.\r\n\r\nIf the frequency is set to the order of nanoseconds, the timer will fire once and then never fire again. The exact frequency varies per machine, however under ~30 nanoseconds seems to affect most machines that are less than 2Ghz.\r\n\r\nThe example app sets the timer to fire every 6 nanoseconds; this will produce one line of output, then the timer will cease firing. If the frequency is changed to 60 nanoseconds, the timer will fire repeatedly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not really healthy to run a timer this fast (vs a thread which can block when it's got nothing to do), we set up this test case to verify that chaining one-shot timers would work even if they miss their time slot.\r\n\r\nThey appear to do so (chaining 6 nanosecond one-shot timers together keeps firing forever), but as a side effect we noticed that repeating timers stop working at these frequencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n'TimerTest.zip' was successfully uploaded"
