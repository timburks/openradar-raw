    description: I like the iCloud-synced reading list feature, but IMO it'd be far more useful if all opened tabs were always synced to all iCloud devices rather than having to send links to the list explicitly. I open open tabs with pages I want to read later but I can never be sure which device I'll be using when the "later" actually arrives and I have time to read. If I don't remember to explicitly add them to the reading list, then I either forget about the articles until I'm on the device that I opened them on or I have to search for them from whatever device I happen to be on. This would be far easier if I could open up a special reading list-like menu and see all open pages on all tabs across all of my iCloud devices from anywhere.
