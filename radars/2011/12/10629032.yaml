    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIWebView freezes entire app when downloading heavy resources (images, videos etc.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the attached project and run it on a device with a strong internet connection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should accept touches while the webview is downloading images.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app completely freezes till all images are downloaded\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFrom my preliminary testing, it seems that although the image download does happen asynchronously, allocing memory and deflating the images seems to freeze up ui."
