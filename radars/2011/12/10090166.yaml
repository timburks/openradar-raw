    description: "07-Sep-2011 07:54 PM Tom Harrington:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n07-Sep-2011 07:54 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS X 10.7.1 apps sometimes get into a \"limbo\" state where they are not running but cannot be started.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nStart an app, optionally use it for a while. Command-tab to some other app, and work in other apps for a while. Then try to go back to the first app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would be able to return to the app and resume using it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAt this point:\r\n1. App's dock icon is highlighted as though it's running.\r\n2. App's icon shows up in the command-tab selector as if it's running.\r\n3. Attempting to switch to the app via command-tab has no effect (the current app remains current, the original app does not return).\r\n4. Clicking on the app's dock icon has no effect-- no bounce, no console message, nothing.\r\n5. Activity Monitor does not show an entry for the app.\r\n\r\nAt this point the app is not running but cannot be started. Rebooting appears to be the only option.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNew in 10.7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached screenshots:\r\n\r\nDock.png: Shows app's dock icon with app highlighted.\r\nActivity Monitor.png: Shows Activity Monitor with app's name entered as a search string, showing no matching processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n15-Sep-2011 10:23 AM Tom Harrington:\r\nThis is an intermittent problem, I'll post details when it happens again.\r\n\r\n\r\n30-Sep-2011 08:59 AM Tom Harrington:\r\nI'm not ignoring this, but I have not been able to reproduce it since filing the bug. If/when it happens again I'll be sure to gather the requested information.\r\n\r\n\r\n31-Oct-2011 07:45 PM Tom Harrington:\r\n'logs.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n31-Oct-2011 07:45 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nHad the issue again today-- the app is Preview but otherwise symptoms are exactly as described in the initial report. It happened today (10/31/2011) at about 6PM (did not note the precise time it started but it was around then).\r\n\r\nI have since upgraded to Mac OS X 10.7.2 (11C74) but it's the same Mac.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching all the requested information-- system.log*, install.log*, and the results of \"sudo sysdiagnose\".\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Nov-2011 03:57 PM Tom Harrington:\r\n'logs.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Nov-2011 03:57 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nAnother occurrence, this time with Xcode, symptoms identical to the initial report. All requested information is attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Nov-2011 04:22 PM Tom Harrington:\r\n'logs 20111111.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Nov-2011 04:22 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nI can't tell if the file was uploaded or not, radar told me it was rejected for having the same name but the log shows \"successfully uploaded\". Trying again just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\n07-Dec-2011 10:27 AM Tom Harrington:\r\n'logs-20111207.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n07-Dec-2011 10:27 AM Tom Harrington:\r\nHappened again today, with Xcode, symptoms exactly as described previously. Logs attached, again.\r\n\r\nIs it actually useful to keep doing this every time it happens?\r\n\r\n13-Dec-2011 09:19 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nHappened yet again today, this time with Preview and with symptoms identical to those described previously.\r\n\r\nI'm not collecting logs this time due to the continued radio silence from Apple. Is anyone listening? Is there any point in collecting this data over and over?\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Jun-2012 04:15 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nThis happened again today for the first time in months. This time with System Preferences and with symptoms identical to previous reports. The Mac is now running Mac OS X 10.7.4.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching all of the previously requested logs again, in case they're useful. Also included is a system profile of the affected Mac. I haven't heard anything on this in six months, I hope someone's listening.\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Jun-2012 04:15 PM Tom Harrington:\r\n'logs-20120606.zip' was successfully uploaded"
