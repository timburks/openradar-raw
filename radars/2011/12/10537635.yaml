    description: "06-Dec-2011 03:27 PM Russell Johnson:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen compiling with ARC with Zombie Objects Enabled an object allocated in a secondary view controller is not deallocated when the secondary view controller is deallocated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe problem will reproduce in the simulator and on devices. Run the sample project do the following steps.\r\n1) Tap the 'info' button to flip to the secondary view controller\r\n2) Notice the NSLog message that the actions controller was initialized\r\n3) Tap the 'done' button to flip back to the root view controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe actions controller should be deallocated and you see this in an NSLog message\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWith the Zombie Objects Enabled setting OFF you will see an NSLog message that the actions controller was deallocated. With Zombie Objects Enabled set to ON the actions controller is not deallocated."
