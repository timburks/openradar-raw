    description: "15-Jul-2011 10:15 AM Benjamin Reed:\r\n'library.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n15-Jul-2011 10:15 AM Benjamin Reed:\r\nSummary: Can't add sub-queries in smart playlists anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: File -> New Smart Playlist\r\n\r\nExpected Results: There should be a + to add a grouping for (All|Any)\r\n\r\nActual Results: The +/- buttons only add and remove at the top level.\r\n\r\nRegression: In previous iTunes 10 releases, you could nest queries, like so:\r\n\r\n* Match: All\r\n  * Match: Any\r\n    - Artist contains: Red Hot Chili Peppers\r\n    - Album Artist contains: Red Hot Chili Peppers\r\n  * Playlist is not: Low Ratings\r\n\r\nNow there doesn't seem to be a way to add these sub-groupings.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have a very large iTunes library (13k tracks, 70 or 80 smart playlists).  I have a couple of common things I do, like the example above, where I match artist and album artist names, and then filter against a playlist that will remove things with 1 or 2 stars.\r\n\r\nAttached is my iTunes Library.xml with all the tracks pulled out (otherwise it's friggin' huge).\r\n\r\n27-Jul-2011 09:50 AM Benjamin Reed:\r\nI can confirm that this regression is still the case in 10.5b60 on Mac OS X Lion (although it no longer crashes when loading existing smart queries that have sub-queries in them)\r\n\r\n04-Aug-2011 07:20 PM Benjamin Reed:\r\n'itunes-no-nested-criteria.swf' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n04-Aug-2011 07:20 PM Benjamin Reed:\r\nAttached is a flash video showing the problem.  I can open an existing playlist with nested criteria, and I can even manipulate that nesting (choosing between \"Any\" and \"All\") but there is no way to create *new* nested criteria.\r\n\r\n09-Dec-2011 12:43 PM Benjamin Reed:\r\nJust to give an update: 10.5.1 on Lion shows the same behavior I've been reporting since the 10.5 betas:\r\n\r\n* existing smart playlists with nested criteria can be edited\r\n* existing smart playlists with nested criteria can be cloned to make new playlists with nested criteria\r\n* there are no controls for adding nested criteria to a new or existing smart playlist"
