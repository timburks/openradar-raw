    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling -setFullscreen:animated: sometimes works, and sometimes is ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Alloc and init an MPMoviePlayerController with a valid file or stream URL\r\n2. Install MPMoviePlayerController's view into view controllers hierarchy in -viewDidLoad\r\n3. call -setFullscreen:YES animated:NO\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen view controller loads, you have a full screen video playback view \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo fullscreen view. MPMoviePlayerController's view is installed and embedded in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDo all of the above, but call -setFullscreen: from an NSTimer and it'll work just fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
