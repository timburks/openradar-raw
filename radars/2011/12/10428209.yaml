    description: "10-Nov-2011 01:15 PM W Lewis:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nConvertArrayToKeyAttributes() (and therefore the public API functions which call it) does not handle most of the key attributes. This function lives in SecImportExportUtils.cpp and is invoked by the import and export APIs.\r\n\r\nThe only conversion it performs is kSecAttrIsPermanent -> CSSM_KEYATTR_PERMANENT. I would expect the other useful keyattrs to be handled as well--- I'm particularly interested in kSecAttrIsExtractable -> CSSM_KEYATTR_EXTRACTABLE, but CSSM_KEYATTR_PRIVATE and CSSM_KEYATTR_SENSITIVE are also useful.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from the 10.6 APIs. See also RADAR #10274369."
