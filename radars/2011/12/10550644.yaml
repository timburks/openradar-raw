    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the \"Converting to Storyboards Release Notes\" document, it says the following:\r\n\r\nThe dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier: method is guaranteed to return a cell (provided that you have defined a cell with the given identifier). Thus there is no need to use the “check the return value of the method” pattern as was the case in the previous typical implementation of tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:.\r\n\r\nHowever, when VoiceOver is the one asking for cells, -dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier returns nil. This breaks the assertion made by the above release notes.\r\n\r\nAn extremely simple repro case is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on VoiceOver on your iPhone or iPod Touch.\r\n2. Run the attached app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crashes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashes."
