    description: "21-Dec-2011 07:14 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\n'Kernel panic and shutdown stall logs.zip' and 'MacBook Air.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n21-Dec-2011 07:14 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2011) that experienced three kernel panics in the last 2 weeks or so.\r\nIn one of the three kernel panic logs I noticed the following line right after the initial timestamp:\r\n\r\npanic(cpu 1 caller 0xffffff7f80a5d9a8): \"rdar://8785596: Status = 1e050195 ExStatus = 16280006 please contact macbook-sw@groups.apple.com. \"@/SourceCache/MEDetect/MEDetect-3.3/MEDetect.cpp:72\r\n\r\nAnother kernel panic log that I think happened during the initial system boot contains only the following two lines:\r\n\r\nFri Dec 16 11:14:49 2011\r\npanic(cpu 1 caller 0xffffff7f8100da9f): \"rdar://8785596: PRSTSb  \r\n\r\nI'm attaching to this bug report all the three kernel panic logs and a \"shutdownStall\" log.\r\nI also tried to write to macbook-sw@groups.apple.com as described in the log but I got back an e-mail with the \"Illegal host/domain name found\" error.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't think that a RadarWeb's bug number and/or an inexistent e-mail address should be printed in a kernel panic log. I'm also very interested in knowing what the rdar://8785596 is about and if it could help to find out the cause of the kernel panics.\r\n\r\n\r\n23-Jan-2012 07:45 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nI discovered that those strange kernel panics were generated at boot time when the MacBook Air was very cold (about 5Â° Celsius) and I forced it to start up by pressing the keyboard's Power button for long time (even 30/60 seconds). If I pressed it briefly the MacBook Air didn't start up at all.\r\nNext, I sent the MacBook Air in for service and I got the logic board replaced under warranty.\r\n\r\n\r\n01-May-2012 09:47 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nYou need to delete MEDetect.kext. \r\n\r\nAccess to 8785596 will not be granted to externals.  You can email us to request status on that issue (devbugs@apple.com).  The issue is under investigation.\r\n\r\nAs for the email address, if the email had been received, the response would have been contact AppleCare."
