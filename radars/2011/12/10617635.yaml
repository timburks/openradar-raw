    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOpening a .keychain file by (for example) double-clicking on it in Finder opens Keychain Access, adds it to the Keychains panel (if necessary), and selects it. However, the contents area displays the contents of the previously selected keychain (or the default keychain) instead.\r\n\r\nTo show the contents of the newly added keychain, I have to select another keychain from the list, then re-select the new keychain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n  Go to the \"/Library/Keychains\" folder in Finder, and double-click on System.keychain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n  Keychain Access should start up, and its contents area should show the contents of the System keychain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n  The contents area shows the contents of the previously selected keychain instead.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n  Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n  It doesn't matter whether or not Keychain Access was already running when I open the .keychain file."
