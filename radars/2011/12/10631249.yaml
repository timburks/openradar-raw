    description: "Summary: I really would like to use the iPad as a digital picture frame when not otherwise in use. However, it's options do not allow long picture change times like 15 min, 1h, 4h, 24h. PLEASE ADD THIS! \r\n\r\nChanging the picture every 20 seconds can be as distracting as a running TV when you are in a talk with someone.\r\n\r\nWhile you're at it, please add sleep/wake timers so the \"picture frame\" (iPad) can be put to sleep during night time and automatically continue with the slide show on the next day.\r\n\r\nThis will make the iPad an even better product."
