    description: "20-Sep-2011 06:59 PM Dirk Theisen:\r\nSummary: SD cards stick out!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\nStick an SD card into any SD card clot on a MacBook.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe card does not go in as expected (and loved) from handling digital cameras, where they stick out only about 1 mm to allow the \"press to release\" mechanics to work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCard sticks out about 3/8\". This way, it cannot stay inside the cassis during transport. Given that the MacBook Air has non upgradeable storage, it would only be fair to allow users to stick and keep an SD card in for an additional volume.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease fix in future revisions of the hardware."
