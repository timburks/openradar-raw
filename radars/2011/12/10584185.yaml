    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning Instruments and profiling any process with any profile makes my mouse jump over the screen on my iMac 12,2 with OS X 10.7.2. Moving the mouse makes it sometimes stop and then jump several dozen pixels at once. This is extremely annoying and makes it nearly impossible to use the computer afterwards. It is only fixed by logging out and logging back in, neither stopping the profiling nor closing Instruments helps at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Start Instruments\r\n* Select any profile\r\n* Select any process/application\r\n* Click the \"Record\" button in the toolbar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe mouse would work normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mouse is jumping over the screen when moving, making it very hard to use the computer afterwards. This is still present even after closing Instruments.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not a CPU load problem. All CPU cores only show a minimal load in Activity Monitor. This bug was already present for me since switching to Developer Tools 4 and OS X 10.7.\r\nThis effect is more noticeable using a mouse. Using a trackpad (Magic Trackpad) makes the jumps still appear but they are smaller."
