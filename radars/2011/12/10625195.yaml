    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen the meta viewport tag is set to content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\", or any value that allows user-scaling, changing the device to landscape orientation causes the page to scale larger than 1.0. As a result, a portion of the page is cropped off the right, and the user must double-tap (sometimes more than once) to get the page to zoom properly into view.\r\n\r\nWhen switching to portrait mode, the layout adapts perfectly. The issue only occurs in landscape. If the content attribute is adjusted with either user-scalable=no or maximum-scale=1, the problem goes away, but then scaling is disabled, which is undesirable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open http://filamentgroup.com/examples/iosScaleBug/ in portrait orientation on an iOS device or emulator.\r\n2. Change to landscape orientation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe page should remain scaled at 1.0, and the page width should shrink to fit the viewport.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe page is zoomed past 1.0, cropping a portion of the page from view and causing the content to be much too large.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDevelopers should not have to disable user-scaling to enable smooth changes in orientation.\r\n\r\nThis bug only affects Mobile Safari: in-app web browsing (using webviews) doesn't display the same behaviour.\r\n\r\nSee also: http://adactio.com/journal/5088/"
