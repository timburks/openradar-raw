    description: "SecKeyGenerateSymmetric generates 3DES keys w/ an undocumented kSecAttrKeyType\r\n\r\nMac OS X SDK, Other Bug, 10.7.2 (11C73), Always reproducible.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen SecKeyGenerateSymmetric is called with kSecAttrKeyType set to kSecAttrKeyType3DES, it produces a symmetric key with a mismatching, undocumented kSecAttrKeyType value (@\"17\", a.k.a. CSSM_ALGID_3DES_3KEY_EDE). \r\n\r\nThese keys seem to confuse Keychain Access as well. The resulting key's detail window displays the following \"kind\":\r\n\r\n  \"symmetric key, <CSSM_ALGID: 17>, 192-bit\"\r\n\r\n3DES keys generated by SecKeyGenerateSymmetric should have kSecAttrType3DES as their key type. Alternatively, the value of the kSecAttrType3DES constant should be changed from \"77\" to \"17\".\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild and run the attached project. It creates a keychain called \"Test Keychain\" in a temp directory and generates a 3DES key into it using SecKeyGenerateSymmetric.  Open Keychain Access and find the new keychain and its freshly generated 3DES key.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe generated key should have a key type attribute of kSecAttrKeyType3DES (with the value @\"77\", corresponding to CSSM_ALGID_3DES) and Keychain Access should display the type of the generated key as \"3DES\", or a similarly descriptive algorithm name.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe generated key has the unlisted, undocumented attribute value of @\"17\", which is the decimal value of  CSSM_ALGID_3DES_3KEY_EDE.  When I double-click the key in Keychain Access, the Kind field displays \"symmetric key, <CSSM_ALGID: 17>, 192-bit\". (Screen shot attached.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone; SecKeyGenerateSymmetric and kSecAttrKeyType3DES are new in 10.7.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
