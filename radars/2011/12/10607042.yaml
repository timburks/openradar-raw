    description: "20-Dec-2011 09:59 AM Zev Eisenberg:\r\n'iChat timestamp.png' was successfully uploaded (hosted at http://cl.ly/CkSs for openRadar)\r\n\r\n20-Dec-2011 09:59 AM Zev Eisenberg:\r\nSummary: iChat omits timestamps at times when it is very misleading to do so.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open iChat\r\n2. go to iChat Preferences -> Messages\r\n3. enable \"Save chat transcripts to:\"\r\n4. Enable \"In new chat windows, show:\" (I have mine set to 25 messages; haven't tested with other numbers)\r\n5. Receive a message.\r\n6. Close the chat window.\r\n7. wait a long time (long enough that you don't remember what the last message you received from that person was, e.g. a weekend).\r\n8. Receive a new message from that person.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niChat should insert a timestamp (and a datestamp, if appropriate) between the message received a few days ago and the message just received.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe messages are presented as though they came in one right after the other. There are timestamps above and below, but they show time only and not date. In the case where the times happen to appear in chronological order, as in the included screenshot, this is particularly misleading. This has led to quite a few confused conversations at my workplace in which I answer questions that people asked me days ago and I had forgotten about, because it looks like they just asked me.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have only noticed it recently (10.7.1/10.7.2 era), but that may be because that was about when I started using iChat in an office environment rather than because it is a new bug\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached screenshot (at http://cl.ly/CkSs for openRadar), the first message was sent around 5:12 PM on a Friday and the second message was sent around 5:57 PM on a Monday. I had forgotten the context of the first message from three days before, so I walked over to talk to the person who had asked the question. Needless to say, he had no idea why I was answering a question that, as far as he could remember, he hadn't asked!\r\n\r\n\r\n12-Mar-2013 04:28 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in OS X Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nThe GM version of OS X 10.8.2 is available now.
