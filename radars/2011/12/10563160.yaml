    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI cannot draw connections between different view controllers in the storyboard editor. I am guessing that this is because under the hood each scene is stored in a separate nib file; the storyboard editor won't let me add multiple view controllers to a scene to test this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In the attached demo project, open MainStoryboard.storyboard.\r\n2. Select the FlippingViewController.\r\n3. Open the Connections inspector.\r\n4. Drag a connection from the firstController outlet to the FirstViewController instance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA connection is made.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo connection is made.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI can live with not being able to draw connections between scenes, but I really need to be able to set up connections between multiple view controllers."
