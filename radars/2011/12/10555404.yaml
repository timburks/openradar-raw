    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS Simulator (on iOS 5.x SDK) hangs for a while everytime I start playing audio via AudioQueues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a Xcode project\r\n- Add some AudioQueue playback code (AVFoundation should trigger the same behavior)\r\n- Build & Run the app in iOS 5 simulator\r\n- Start Audio playback\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Audio starts playback\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The Simulator generates some log output (see attached file)\r\n- The Audio playback starts after some seconds delay (during which the log output is generated)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Running the iOS Simulator on iOS 4.2 doesn't cause this behaviour\r\n- Also theres no problem running the same code on the device\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSearching for the log output reveals that many people are faced with that issue."
