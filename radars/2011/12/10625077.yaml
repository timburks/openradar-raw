    description: "Summary:\r\nHaving multiple displays becomes inefficient when utilizing fullscreen apps and mission control. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect at least two displays. Fullscreen an app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe other display would allow me to fullscreen another window of the same or another app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe other display instantly becomes useless.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked slightly better with Spaces in Snow Leopard, but was still inefficient.\r\n\r\nPossible Fix:\r\nAllow independent control of Mission Control and Fullscreen apps on each display. This includes adding a Menu Bar (for the current app) on each display and Dock to the second display, detecting which display a swipe was on, and keeping track of a separate number of screens on each display. This allows the flexibility users expect when using multiple displays. Current focus can be shown by only showing the Menu Bar for the currently focused application, except on the appropriate screen. Mission Control gestures should also follow the current position of the mouse, and be applicable separately to each display, allowing spaces to be switched independently of each display. Also, while in Mission Control, control-option clicking a space would lock it to the corresponding space on the other display, making the other display switch when the screen is brought to the front. This indication may be shown by using a smaller version of the other screen on the thumbnail of the screen where the event took place."
