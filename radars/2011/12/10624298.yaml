    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn XCode, if one has a sufficient number of files in the project navigator such that scrolling down is possible, when one creates a new group in the project navigator, the downwardness of the scrolling in the project navigator is reset with the result that the new group is out of sight at worst or at best not in the same place on the screen that it was to begin with.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(1)  Launch XCode\r\n(2)  Add a bunch of groups/files to the project navigator such that one can scroll down in the project navigator and still see a group within which one can create a subgroup.\r\n(3)  Scroll down.\r\n(4)  Add a subgroup to the group which is visible (from step 2).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe downwardness of the scrolling (from the top) in the project navigator will be as it was before the new group was created, but the new group will be present within the group in which it was created.  The new group will be highlighted and in editting mode so that the user need only type to change the name.  (Same behaviour as creating a new folder in finder.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe height of the scrolling in the project navigator is reset.  Neither the new group nor the previously selected old group in which it was created is selected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
