    description: "When clicking \"See all\" in the \"New\" section of any App Store category page in iTunes, a part of the apps shown is clearly not updated for a long time. Those apps' names start with numbers or the letters \"AA\" or \"AB\".\r\n\r\nIt looks like following the validly promoted apps, arbitrary apps are listed sorted alphabetically.\r\n\r\nThe number of those \"invalid\" apps varies from country to country: From zero in the US to all in Norway. In the latter case this even affects the display of the \"New\" section at the category root (see \"Navigation Root NO.png\").\r\n\r\nI've attached a bunch of screenshots that illustrate the problem.\r\n\r\nAttachment: http://d.pr/G321"
