    description: "Summary:\r\nWe need a way to immediately lock an iOS device. In general usage, a 1-2 minute window before a passcode is required is very useful, and considerably reduces time wasted daily on passcode entry. But there are times when one must immediately lock a device, and shutting it down -- which takes time, in addition to boot-uptime, and disrupts current activity -- is inappropriate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet a short timer before passcode lock.\r\nLeave an iPad on a table, perhaps in a restaurant or to go to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS should offer a way to immediately lock the device *just this time*.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPasscode lock is either set to Immediately (requiring considerable wasted time on passcode entry) or after a few minutes, leaving a window of vulnerability."
