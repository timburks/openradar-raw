    description: "Summary:\r\nWe can't start using git from command line after installing Xcode for the first time\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download dmg containing Xcode.app bundle\r\n2. Open it and copy Xcode.app into /Applications\r\n3. Launch Terminal.app and try to use git (e.g. invoke `git clone git://some.public/repo.git`)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuccessful cloning of repository located at git://some.public/repo.git\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBash can't find git.\r\n-bash: git: command not found\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWe were able to use git right after installation of Xcode 4.x. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can not use git even after I ran Xcode first time after installation. So I have to modify my ~/.profile manually to add required directories to PATH env variable."
