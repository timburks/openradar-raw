    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI'm trying to add a UIViewController subclass to my storyboard that is a container for other view controllers. I can't find a way to connect the container view controller to the child view controllers. Unlike for Navigation and Tab Bar view controllers, there's no \"Relationship\" outlet for me to draw from, and due to rdar://problem/10563160 IB won't let me draw regular outlet connections between view controllers in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In the attached demo project, open MainStoryboard.storyboard.\r\n2. Select the FlippingViewController.\r\n3. Open the Connections inspector.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA \"Relationship\" outlet at the bottom of the \"Segue\" section that can be used to define connections from the FlippingViewController to the FirstViewController and SecondViewController.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo \"Relationship\" outlet."
