    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you call -remove: on an NSTreeController, it will send -removeObjectsAtIndexes: to the ancestors of the deleted objects, including to the target of the tree controller's contentArray binding. The NSIndexSet argument will be empty.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to send these messages, and in fact doing so imposes the otherwise unnecessary restriction that the object to which the tree controller's contentArray binding points be a mutable collection (either an NSMutableArray or a mutable to-many property).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build and run the attached demo project.\r\n2. Select a number of non-root objects.\r\n3. Click the Delete button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe objects are deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe objects are deleted, and the AppDelegate logs a bunch of messages complaining that it was asked to -removeObjectsAtIndexes: from the immutable contentArray object."
