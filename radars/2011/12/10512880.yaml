    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen communicating with a Tableau Server that enables NTLM, some POSTs don't have NTLM credentials, which confuses the server\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClient does two posts that return 401 from apache as part of the negotiation, then third post contains all credentials and succeeds.  This third post sometimes has no content in the body even though the first post in the stream (the first one that returns 401) does have the content.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll requests work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome requests don't have credentials and server gets confused. See attached Fiddler trace.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt's possible this was introduced with Lion versions of Safari, I don't recall running into something similar earlier"
