    description: "29-Dec-2011 10:43 AM Joshua Tessier:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn our application, we have the ability to gather log files and e-mail them to a support e-mail.  These files are zipped up and added as an attachment to the e-mail.\r\n\r\nWhen the user presses 'Save Draft', the zip file is sometimes lost.\r\n\r\nThoughts:\r\n-This could be an issue with certain e-mail providers (i.e. GMAIL versus Corporate Exchange)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-OPen mail composer in application\r\n-Attach zip file\r\n-Press 'Save Draft'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-Attachment is always kept\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-Attachment is lost.
