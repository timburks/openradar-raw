    description: "Summary:  \r\n\r\nI've uncovered what appears to be a bug where you need to focus a window twice in order for Finder to return the correct result over the scripting bridge or AppleScript. This only happens when opening a folder from the desktop or another space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Close, hide or minimize all windows until the desktop is showing.\r\n2. Open any folder on the desktop, a new finder window will appear. Select any file in that finder window by clicking on it once.\r\n3. Open your AppleScript Editor and run the following script:\r\n\r\ntell application \"Finder\"\r\n    return selection\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe script should return the path to the selected item in the foremost window of the Finder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe script will return only the path to the folder on the desktop, not the selected file in the finder window.\r\n\r\nIf you refocus the window, or click on the file again, everything works as expected and the script returns the correct path.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe problem happens every time.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
