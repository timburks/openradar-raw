    description: "27-Dec-2011 11:05 AM Andrew Norman:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAdding two playlists in a row leaves UI in confused state\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen Music app\r\nAdd a new playlist, call it \"A\"\r\nAdd a couple of tracks to the new playlist\r\nTap the \"Done\" in the top right hand corner of the screen\r\n\r\nAdd a second playlist, call it \"B\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe UI should be in a clean state and the \"Done\" button should work and return you from the playlist creation mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe UI is not in a clean state. The list of tracks still shows that the tracks you added to playlist \"A\" are already added to playlist \"B\" (they are not actually added to  \"B\").\r\n\r\nIf you then add some tracks to \"B\", the \"Done\" button does not become successfully enabled. If you tap on \"Done\" nothing happens, the UI does not exit the playlist creation mode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFirst observed in iOS 5.0 on a 4th gen iPod Touch. Confirmed on an iPhone 4S running iOS 5.01\r\n\r\nHas been 100% reproducible on the devices I've tried it on."
