    description: "Please add an API or a URL scheme to allow us to add links to the user's iCloud Reading List. It doesn't need to be automatic or invisible, but it'd be nice to be able to call a single method with a URL and the user gets a standard alert prompt notifying them that some URL is being requested to be added to their Reading List and to Allow/Deny it. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nThe use case is, in Twitterrific we offer integration with many bookmarking services such as Instapaper, Read It Later, etc. that users can use to remember links in tweets they want to read later. Some people would like to just use the built in Reading List, but there's no obvious way to offer that as a bookmarking option - which is sort of ironic because all the other services require authentication and external accounts and the reading list is pretty much automatically always available on iOS 5+ - but they can't easily use it in this context!"
