    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a UIScrollView as the view property of a UIViewController it is expected that the frame would underlap a translucent status bar and translucent UINavigationBar. However, this is not the case when such a view controller is pushed onto the navigation stack and the status bar and navigation bar translucent properties are changed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Subclass UIViewController\r\n__In Interface Builder__\r\n2. Drag out UIScrollView and delete UIView from docs area\r\n3. Wire view outlet to UIScrollView instance\r\n__In implementation__\r\n4. In viewDidLoad make following calls:\r\n    [self setWantsFullScreenLayout:YES];\r\n    [[[self navigationController] navigationBar] setBarStyle:UIBarStyleBlack];\r\n    [[[self navigationController] navigationBar] setTranslucent:YES];\r\n    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleBlackTranslucent animated:NO];\r\n5. Push subclassed view controller onto navigation stack (previous navigation bar and status bar translucent properties can be YES or NO, does not matter).\r\n\r\nIt may be helpful to install a UILabel or other element at (0,0) in UIScrollView to verify that visual element underlaps status and navigation bars\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAny elements at y-coordinates 0 - 64pt should show through translucent bars\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nScroll View's origin is repositioned to (0,64) of UIScreen mainScreen\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- Have not tested programmatic creation of view interface.\r\n- Have not tested installing subclassed view controller as root view controller of navigation controller\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI would really like to know if this is \"expected\" behavior or something else. I cannot find anything in documentation. Best I could find is the document \"Adopting a Full Screen Layout for Navigation Views\""
