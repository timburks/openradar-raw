    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen sending video to an Apple TV via AirPlay my iPhone app crashes\r\n\r\n- Create a new single-view iPhone app\r\n- Add the 'audio' mode to the app's 'Required Background Modes' in the info.plist (so that AirPlay playback will continue if the screen is locked or the app is suspended).\r\n- Add a 'play' button to the view and hook it up to a 'play:' action\r\n- Add the MediaPlayer and AVFoundation frameworks\r\n- Implement the 'play:' method to set an appropriate Audio Session category and create and present an MPMoviePlayerViewController\r\n- Run the app and choose to send the video to an Apple TV via AirPlay.\r\n- Suspend the app and lock the screen\r\n- Press the home button to attempt to wake up the iPhone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The video will continue to play on the TV screen connected to the Apple TV whilst the app is suspended and I'll be able to lock/unlock my screen and use other apps etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The app crashes and video stops playing on the Apple TV.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- The crash happens on my iPhone 4S that is running iOS5.0.1 (9A405) but the exact same code works fine on my iPad2 that is running iOS5.0 (9A334)."
