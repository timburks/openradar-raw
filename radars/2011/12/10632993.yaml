    description: "I'm a little bit confused by how I'm supposed to use this API under Sandboxing and am thinking this might  be either a bug or at least a Documentation Bug.\r\n\r\nTo explain the problem I made a little Demo App that needs to obviously be run once (so that there is something in the \"path\" key in the .plist), but then it doesn't work under Sandboxing while working without Sandboxing and while I'm having com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at https://github.com/stuffmc/SubPathAtPath and let me know if I can help isolate the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks."
