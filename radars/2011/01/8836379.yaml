    description: "Summary: A malicious developer could easily prevent users from downloading a competitor's app from the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be an evil person.\r\n2. Create an app, perhaps a free demo to maximize downloads.\r\n3. Either use a competitor's bundle ID for the app itself, or have the app install hidden dummy apps using competitors' bundle IDs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: It should still be possible to purchase the competitors' apps from the Mac App Store, since they aren't actually installed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: It is not possible to purchase the competitors' apps from the Mac App Store. For the average user it may be difficult to understand why this is happening. They may decide to purchase the malicious developer's app even if they preferred a competitor's, simply because it is the only app of this type they are able to purchase.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem could be solved by checking the user's actual purchase history before deciding whether an app is \"installed\". If the app seems to be present on the user's computer, but it was never purchased from the Mac App Store, it should still be possible to purchase the app. Perhaps a warning could be presented to help prevent users from purchasing an app they had bought elsewhere. Ideally this warning could include the location of the installed app(s) to help the user understand what is triggering this warning. This would also make it easy to remove the app(s) if they were installed maliciously or otherwise unwanted."
