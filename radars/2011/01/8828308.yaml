    description: "Summary:\r\nWe received several crash reports with\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'CALayerInvalidGeometry', reason: 'CALayer position contains NaN: [0 nan]'\r\n\r\noriginating from the AddressBookUI framework. Please see the crash reports attached.\r\nWhile we were not able to reproduce this particular backtrace, we created a little test project with an ABPeoplePickerNavigationController that crashes *in the simulator* reproducibly with\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'CALayerInvalidGeometry', reason: 'CALayer position contains NaN: [nan -0.5]'\r\n\r\nWe were NOT able to reproduce the crash on our test devices (iPhone 4 running iOS 4.1 and iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.2.1). However, this might be due to specific circumstances not met on our devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Reset the simulator content (to make sure we have a sane AddressBook)\r\n- Create 2 contacts using \"Contacts\": one with just a name, one with name and an address\r\n- Build the attached test project and run it in the simulator.\r\n- Tap the \"Address Book\" button\r\n- Select the contact with address\r\n- Go back\r\n- Select the contact without address\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contact without address should be shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes. Crash report \"ABPersonVCBug.crash\" attached.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHappens in the simulator on iOS 4.0.2, 4.1 and 4.2. Not reproducible on our test devices."
