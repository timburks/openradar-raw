    description: "27-Jan-2011 09:34 AM Marcus Brito:\r\nThe new SCM features in Xcode 4 is great, and I particularly appreciate the git support. That being said, many people will always choose another system, and the SCM marked is far from being consolidated on one or two choices.\r\n\r\nXcode 4 should support a pluggable interface for version control operations, so third party developers could write plugins that bring scm du jour integration to Xcode. Good for Apple, good for us."
