    description: "24-Jan-2011 11:36 AM Martin Alleus:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen restoring in-app purchase products, any products of the \"subscription\" type is completely ignored. The documentation states that the application should present its own system for identifying the user, and store that information on a separate server. This creates a confusing and non intuitive experience for the user. The user is forced to identify himself/herself both to the application itself, and to the App Store interface.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEasy reproduced with two devices. With the first device, run an application that sells one or more subscription type in-app purchase products to the user. Open up the second device with the same application and perform the restore procedure ([[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] restoreCompletedTransactions]).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf this was working as I'm suggesting, the application would receive the transactions of the previously purchased subscription products.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo transactions at all is sent to the application, because subscription products are ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe way to solve this, according to advice from the App Store Review Team is to present a separate authentication (username/password) that will identify the user. This means two separate authentication systems will be presented inside the application (since the in-app purchase authentication is presented through regular UIAlertViews). This is both confusing and unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAn alternative to getting the expected results (having transactions restored from [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] restoreCompletedTransactions]) would be to allow access to information about the logged in Apple ID. If the StoreKit framework had provided some kind of ID (similar to the transaction ID), the process of identifying users and keeping track of, and restoring, subscriptions would be much more streamlined."
