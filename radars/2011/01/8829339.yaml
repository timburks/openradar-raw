    description: "06-Jan-2011 02:36 PM Daniel Jalkut:\r\nA major customer confusion point stems from the fact that the App Store app identifies an application with matching bundle ID and version number as \"installed\" on the customer's Mac. My experience halfway through day one of fielding customer responses to this is they expect full integration with the Mac App Store features of updating, giving reviews, etc., based on this indication.\r\n\r\nClearly there are two classes of \"installed\" apps: those installed by Mac App Store, and which afford the customer all the privileges of being a MAS-purchasing owner of the software, and those installed by the user independently of the Mac App Store, which may share attributes with the MAS app such as name, version number, and bundle ID.\r\n\r\nTo reduce confusion please consider splitting the \"installed\" flag into two: \"Installed\" and \"3rd Party Install\" or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel"
