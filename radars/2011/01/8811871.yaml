    description: "Summary:\r\niPad and iPod touch do not auto-update clock\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the iPad or iPod touch for a month, and watch the time get several minutes out of sync with reality (here \"reality\" means http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/ ). Open Settings, General, Date & Time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn iPhone, there is a switch \"Set Automatically\". When left on, the iPhone will get its time (from the carrier? ntp? I don't know).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPad and iPod touch both have only manual time setting, like some primitive device from the 1990s. Remember VCRs, always blinking 12:00 because nobody except me could read the manuals? Well, that's what this is like. This is a Windows-class user experience.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be easy enough to check every hour or so if wifi is on, and call ntpd."
