    description: "Summary:\r\nThe lack of trials on the Mac App Store severely limits the investment a customer is willing to make. If a customer sees an app that piques their interest, and can try it free for (say) 14 days, they’re far more likely to decide that it’s worth the money than if they only get to look at screenshots (or even movies) of it. There’s no better way for a customer to get a feel for the app than to use it, and likewise, there’s no better way for a developer to hook a customer than with a free trial which sells the polish of the app.\r\n\r\nAs a comparison, I have personally found that the iBooks samples to be the perfect hook. Once I’ve read the first few pages I’m far more likely to pay to read the rest. The same thing happens in a physical book store: I prefer buying physical books in a brick and mortar store (or online, if they have selected a good sample chapter) because I can leaf through and get some experience with the writing, whether it says something that intrigues me, whether it’s written in a way that I will want to continue reading. I think this is exactly analogous to the situation with apps in the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nI have long felt that this was a serious lack in the iOS App Store, but if anything it’s even more so in the Mac App Store due to the increased scope of the applications; increased development time and resources mean higher overheads, which means that a higher price is going to be required to be profitable. And of course profitable (without being _over_priced) apps are good for everyone: the users get good apps, developers get money—and so does Apple, both through the 30% cut and the increased investment by users in their Macs (and their next Mac, and the one after that, plus one for their parents and kids and …).\r\n\r\nIn addition, this would be an excellent opportunity for Apple to standardize some conventions with trials to avoid confusing a naïve userbase. For example, Apple could mandate user interface elements (perhaps even ones provided by Apple specifically for this purpose via new APIs) which state, clearly, how much longer is left in the trial. Apple-provided UI elements would also make it easy for the customer to buy the full version from within it. This could even occur outside the app’s address space to ensure that nothing can interfere with the transaction, in a manner similar to how the Dock can interact with an application externally to it.\r\n\r\nIf this proved successful—as I believe it will—it would then be a good starting point to introduce something similar on the iOS App Store, if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
