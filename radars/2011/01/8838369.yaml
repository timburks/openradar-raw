    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Mac App Store uses an app's bundle ID and version number to detect whether an app is already installed, regardless of whether it was purchased in the Mac App Store or from another source. This also applies to demo copies of an app downloaded from a third-party developer's web site.\r\n\r\nPotential customers trying an app by downloading a demo version from outside the store cannot then purchase a full copy in the Mac App Store. The Mac App Store will show \"Installed\" instead of a buy button until the user drags the old application to the trash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Download a demo of (for example) Panic's Coda from their web site.\r\n* Load the product page for Coda in the Mac App Store.\r\n* The button will say \"Installed\" and prevent purchase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* Mac App Store should detect if a purchase was from the Mac App Store (look for the receipt file) and if not, still allow the user to purchase the app; or:\r\n* Always allow the user to purchase the app even if the Mac App Store thinks it is already installed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* The only work-around is to change the bundle ID or version number between Mac App Store apps vs. direct-download apps, but both of these have other serious drawbacks such as different preference files or version confusing for users. The real solution is for the Mac App Store to be smarter about how it handles apps installed outside the store.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nRelated bugs:\r\n\r\nrdar://8829339\r\nrdar://8829382"
