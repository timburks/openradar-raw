    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFiles that begin with two periods are visible in the Finder. All files beginning with a period are typically hidden on UNIX systems, e.g. via CLI `ls` command.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Terminal.app.\r\n2. Run `touch .testfile`.\r\n3. Run `touch ..testfile`.\r\n4. Open a Finder window in your home folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNeither .testfile nor ..testfile should appear in the Finder window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n.testfile is correctly hidden, but ..testfile does appear in the list of files.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nVerified back to OS X 10.6.5. Likely occurred in earlier versions, but I don't have ready access (and don't recall when Vim started saving these files).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone."
