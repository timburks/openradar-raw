    description: "iOS (Both iPad SDK and iPhone SDK) only have the CGPDF API to deal with PDF files. Mac OS provides the PDF Kit framework with a good object oriented API. Please bring the PDF Kit to iOS.\r\n\r\nEven if the API is not as complete the the Mac OS API, it would be nice to have a least some basic stuff such as PDFDocument, PDFPage and PDFOutline available."
