    description: "Summary:\r\nFor the proper installation and deployment of applications that utilize Ruby on OS X, the symlinks in /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby should be corrected. This would allow installs on fresh, unbooted images of OS X to work as if they were being installed from the booted volume.\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install any version OS X since 10.5.0\r\n- Mount the volume on any other system\r\n- in Terminal, run \"cd /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby\"\r\n- examine the number of back-references in the symbolic links for site_ruby and user-gems\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthere should be 9 back references, ../../../../../../../../../Library/Ruby/Site\r\nActual Results:\r\nthere are 10, \r\n../../../../../../../../../../Library/Ruby/Site\r\nwhich is a silent error once the volume is booted\r\nRegression:\r\nIncorrect number of back-references are also present in 10.5.x, all versions \r\nNotes:\r\nThis causes failures in the deployment of the state configuration management tool Puppet, which is in use all over the world and strives to follow the symlinks correctly to maintain backwards compatibility with 10.4.\r\nThis bugreport may be a duplicate of one submitted by Karl Kuehn \r\nAttached photo credit(additional enclosure): Joseph Chilcote"
