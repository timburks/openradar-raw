    description: "Summary: App Store does not properly handle how to display when there are no updates available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open the App Store from your iOS device. If you have opened it previously, close it and re-open it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A blank screen that says \"All Apps Are Up To Date\"\r\n\r\nActual Results: A screen with a white bar across the top, an Update All button available, a badge icon with the number 0. If you re-open the app store after opening it once and not closing it again, it will continuously show \"Loading\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
