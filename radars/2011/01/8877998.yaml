    description: "Summary:\r\nApplications that are installed via the Mac App Store should be updated through the commonly used and known \"Software Update\" mechanism and not through the Mac App Store Application\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuy an Application on the Mac App Store.\r\nWait until there is an update available for this Application\r\nFire up Software update from the Apple Menu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSoftware Update should list the Apple Updates for Mac OS X and all the Updates for App Store installed Applications as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly System Updates and Updates to Apple's own Applications show up in Software Update.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsers are used to seeing the software update dialog pop up from time to time. Most users will not understand that they have to look in TWO places to Update their Mac's software now. This is especially bad since Sparkle autoupdates are prohibited on the Mac App Store which would allow the user to be notified of updates."
