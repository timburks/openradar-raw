    description: "Xcode DP6 removes the ability to pass -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2 to Clang to get automatically @synthesized properties.\r\n\r\nFrom discussion in the developer forums, Apple reps have stated that this feature will not be available in Xcode 4:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/360301\r\n\r\nI have not encountered any problems with extensive use of this feature and have enjoyed it immensely. It is absolutely wonderful especially when creating \"model\" objects:\r\n\r\nhttp://nfarina.com/post/2061838727/smmodelobject\r\n\r\nIt eliminates a ton of unnecessary boilerplate.\r\n\r\nI really urge you guys to consider leaving this feature in as you continue to review it. I just love it so damn much and would hate to go revisit all our code!\r\n\r\nThanks, Nick."
