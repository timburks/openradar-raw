    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen the user purchases an app from the Mac App Store and a previous version exists in /Applications in a sub-folder, that version is overwritten.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis happened to me with RapidWeaver, so:\r\n- install RapidWeaver 4 in /Applications/rapidweaver_442.  This is typically done so that multiple versions of an app can coexist\r\n- purchase RapidWeaver 5 from the Mac App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expected it to create the new version as /Applications/RapidWeaver and leave the folder alone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt placed the new app in the rapidweaver_442 folder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nMy first attempt to fix this was to rename the folder \"hideme\" and use the Purchases tab in the App Store application to install the app again.  Although it properly noticed that the app was missing, when I told it to install again it overwrote the same copy, which was now located in /Applications/hideme.  I had to completely delete the folder and install the app again before it properly created /Applications/RapidWeaver.\r\n\r\nI believe that *no* application not installed through the App Store should be removed - an existing version that was installed manually should always be renamed rather than overwritten.  Reasonable people could debate that point. However, when the app is placed in a sub-folder that's a clear sign that this is a user who knows what they're doing and expects to run several versions at once.  IMHO any files not at the top level of /Applications should not exist as far as the App Store installer is concerned."
