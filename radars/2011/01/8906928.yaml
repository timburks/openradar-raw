    description: "24-Jan-2011 11:36 AM Devin Chalmers:\r\nSummary:\r\nAccording to the documentation for UITextViewDelegate -textViewDidChange:, the method should only be called in response to user input, not programmatic changes to the text view's text:\r\n\"The text view calls this method in response to user-initiated changes to the text. This method is not called in response to programmatically initiated changes.\"\r\nHowever, if the text view is first responder, the delegate method is called even by programmatic changes to the text.\r\n\r\nSee attached project: it should produce no logger output except in response to keyboard events; when the text view is first responder, however, the change events are fired even when no keys have been pressed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nChange the \"text\" property of a UITextView that is first responder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe textViewDidChange: method is not called, as per the documentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe textViewDidCHange: method is not called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI did not experience this bug in iOS 3.2, but no longer possess the SDK to verify this."
