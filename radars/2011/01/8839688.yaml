    description: "Summary:\r\nUISplitViewController resets the navigationBar tint of its master view controller (the view controller at index 0 of the split view's viewControllers property) to the default tint after this view controller is displayed inside a popover.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open and build the attached SplitViewTint project.\r\n2. Rotate the device to landscape to view the blue navigationBar tint.\r\n3. Rotate to portrait.\r\n4. Rotate back to landscape: observe the blue tint is still in place.\r\n5. Rotate back to portrait and tap the UIBarButtonItem to display the popover.\r\n6. Tap to dismiss the popover and rotate back to landscape: observe the custom tint is lost.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe custom tint colour should remain whenever the navigationBar is displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe custom tint is lost after displaying the view controller inside a popover.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue was not present in iOS 3.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached sample project should have enough information to reproduce the issue. I have attempted to work around this in my own projects by manually resetting the tint after the view controller is displayed without success.\r\n\r\n<< The attached file can be downloaded here: http://cl.ly/0a291z0I1q2Y0V3B3q1S >>"
