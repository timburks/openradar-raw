    description: "Summary: Apps saved by Xcode's Build and Archive command cannot be found by Spotlight. The same app is still found if you open the contextual menu on a file that that app opens. It also is found by the Installer, resulting in a related bug where the Installer installs over an app that can't be later found via Spotlight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an existing Mac OS app project or create a new one, setting the bundle ID to a unique value.\r\n2. Build and Archive the app.\r\n3. Open the Organizer from the Window menu.\r\n4. Click on the archived app in the Organizer's sidebar.\r\n5. Right click on the archived app, and select Show In Finder and open the folder for the archive to verify the location of the app.\r\n6. Verify that the archive is not compressed and the app can be launched by double clicking it.\r\n7. Open the Spotlight search field and type in the name of the app.\r\n8. Verify that the copy of the app in the archive does not show up in Spotlight results.\r\n9. Click the Show All option.\r\n10. Verify that the app does not show up in the search results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Spotlight should find the archived app.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Spotlight does not find the archived app.\r\n\r\nRegression: The Installer does find the same archived app, so if you run the Installer package created from the archived app, it replaces the archived copy of the app, and the newly installed app cannot be found with Spotlight. Also, if you right-click on a file that the app opens, the Open With submenu will show the archived versions of the app. Launching that app and right-clicking the dock icon will let you find the location of that app.\r\n\r\nNotes: Related to another bug report I will file about Installer installing over archived apps."
