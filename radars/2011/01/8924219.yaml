    description: "Many iOS apps offer a \"night mode\" which does things like change screen colors for easier reading or safer driving at night.\r\n\r\nIt would help user if:\r\n\r\n(1) When a user asked for night mode in one application, that app could use iOS API to broadcast the change to other apps. Similarly, each app could check the mode when opened.\r\n\r\n(2) The user could ask for night mode to happen automatically in all compliant apps at certain hours.\r\n\r\n(3) The user could ask for night mode to happen automatically in all compliant apps when the ambient light drops (measured with the camera or other sensors)."
