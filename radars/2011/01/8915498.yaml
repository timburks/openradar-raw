    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nRecently I added a SSD as the boot drive of my MacPro. In doing so I moved my user's home folder to another drive (volume) on the machine. \r\n\r\nAfter this I noticed that when doing a Xcode Build & Run of an iOS App on the iOS Simulator, no further updates will be made to that app without either exiting the Simulator or force quitting it from the Springboard. \r\n\r\nThis is quite a problem because it makes it look like the app is actually restarting itself, but actually it is simply just switching away and back to the Application. A developer could spend a good amount of time trying to figure out why a code change isn't happening, as it's not immediately apparent that the app isn't updating itself as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRequirements: A Mac that has multiple volumes, all to be used must be formatted as HFS+. \r\n\r\n1. Create a new Mac OS X User in System Preferences, Accounts. \r\n     I created an Admin User\r\n2. After it's created, copy it's user profile to folder another volume. \r\n     I used the following ditto command:\r\n     sudo ditto -rsrc \"/Users/USERNAME\" \"/Volumes/OTHERVOLUME/USERNAME\"\r\n3. Change the Home Directory of the new User to the new location set it Step 2\r\n     Instructions: 1) Goto: System Preferences, Accounts. \r\n                             2) Right click on the new User, select Advanced Options. \r\n                             3) Assign Home Directory to the directory from Step 2.\r\n4. Log out and back Log in as the new User.\r\n5. Open Xcode\r\n6. Open any iOS Project\r\n7. Set Xcode to do a iOS Simulator mode\r\n8. Build & Run to launch the Project in the iOS Simulator\r\n9. After the Application is running, now make a change in the code in Xcode\r\n10. Now tell Xcode to do Build & Go again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect that Xcode will terminate the currently simulated iOS application, and then replace it with the newly built binary, and relaunch it. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nInstead Xcode just tells the simulated iOS application to go into the background, and then quickly reopens the same Application again without replacing the iOS Simulator Binary with the newly built and updated Binary. This is different from how it works on a normal Mac OS install.\r\n\r\nI see no error messages in the Console that indicate any clearly defined problem. \r\n\r\nIf you terminate the iOS Simulator or Force Quit the iOS Simulated App between steps 9 and 10 above, then it will work as expected. This adds an extra few steps to the process that makes it quite a bit more annoying to develop on.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis does NOT occur on the same machine if the User folder is on the same Volume as the rest of the Mac OS and Developer Tools. This still occurs in the current iOS 4.3 SDK Betas as well. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe easy solution is to just not move my User folder to another Volume, but if the functionality to do this is in Mac OS I expect the developer tools to be able to handle this situation, despite how rare it may be."
