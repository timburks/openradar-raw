    description: "Summary:\r\nThe public web-based view of Mac App Store product descriptions does not honor line breaks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Open this URL in Safari.\r\n    http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cloudpull/id404445477?mt=12&ls=1\r\n2.  Look at the product description in Safari.\r\n3.  Click on the \"View in Mac App Store\" button.\r\n4.  Look at the product description in (Mac) App Store.\r\n\r\nIn the App Store app (and in iTunes Connect), line breaks in the product description are honored.  In Safari, those line breaks are not honored.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected that the web-based view of the product description would honor the line breaks the same way that the desktop App Store and iTunes Connect honor the line breaks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe web-based view of the product description does not honor the line breaks.  Neither single line breaks nor pairs of line breaks are reflected in the web-based view.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI attached screen shots of a product description, one taken with Safari and one taken with App Store for Mac."
