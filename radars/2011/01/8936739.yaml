    description: "Summary:\r\nRelocatable WiFi hotspots such as MiFi's or Macs with Internet Sharing via AirPort are confusing Core Location. Core Location should do a better job by doing sanity checks like this:\r\n\r\n- Is the Wifi location from Apple's database in the radius of the cell tower location? If not, discard the WiFi location and report it back to Apple as \"relocating WiFi\".\r\n- Without cell tower location, are there different WiFi locations contradicting each other? Then, a voting algorithm could filter out bad entries. This algorithm would filter entries marked as \"relocating WiFi\" on Apple's side.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit an indoor trade show and try to locate your device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLocation detection should be more inaccurate but shouldn't report a completely wrong location (at least if cell tower triangulation is available).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRecently received a Core Location update of \"Erfurt\" (Germany) while I was at a Frankfurt trade show. The cities are several 100 km away from each other. This was on an iPhone 4 with cell connection but without GPS fix (indoor)."
