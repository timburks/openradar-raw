    description: "I would like to be able to tell what index in the play queue the MPMusicPlayerController is currently playing, or even if that info could be passed in with the MPMusicPlayerControllerNowPlayingItemDidChangeNotification\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\n\r\nI'm making an app that lets exercise instructors create classes, and then play the classes, along with displaying cues and whatnot as the songs change.  \"stand here.  go into pain here.  suffer now, etc\"  The user is allowed to include a media item more than once in a class.  They might have a special cool-down song used after each interval, or use a short song as a bumper before some repeating activity.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the 'nowPlayingItem' property isn't sufficient to tell me where I am in the list.\r\n\r\nI do try to keep track of which cue and which media item is playing, but I'm paranoid in case the player gets out of sync with what I think it is doing somehow.  (Can the user bring up the ipod controls while my app is playing its playlist, and move around?).  It'd be awesome to be able to rely completely on the music player.  \"when I see it start playing song number seven, I know to start displaying information about cue number 7\"\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(addendum)\r\nPlease consider exposing indexOfNowPlayingItem from MPMusicPlayerController.  That wold solve all my problems, and let me remove a couple hundred lines of fragile heuristics."
