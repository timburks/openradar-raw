    description: "The Mac App Store should allow screencast videos in addition to still screenshots for showing potential customers what the app looks like. Videos could be limited to 1-2 minutes, at a similar resolution to the existing screenshots, and would be hosted by Apple. Videos would be produced by developers and uploaded just as screenshots are uploaded, via iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nWhy it's important:\r\n\r\nScreencast videos provide much more clarity on what an app can actually do so that customers won't be surprised or disappointed when they purchase and start using the app. It has many of the benefits of full trail demos, but without the complexity of demo limitations, expiration, or app installation."
