    description: "Summary:\r\n-------\r\nThe retraction of the following flag setting in the latest Xcode 4 Developer Preview:\r\n\r\nOTHER_CFLAGS = -Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2\r\n\r\nCauses existing projects where specified in .xcconfig files (or directly set at the project or target level) to fail to compile as it is an unrecognized flag. Commenting out that line then makes the project fail to compile in Xcode 3.2.5. This type of chicken and egg problem leads to lack of use and therefore feedback on the large number of changes in Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would have been nice to mention this as experimental in the release notes for Xcode 3.2.4 and iOS 4.1 back in the summer. Perhaps re-enabling the behavior with a flag for developers that know what they are doing and are able to properly name ivars, properties and method arguments would be a better...\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n---------------\r\nPut OTHER_CFLAGS = -Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2 into an existing Xcode 3.2.5 Project and compile. Then, open the same project in Xcode 4 DP6.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-------------\r\nCompiles correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-----------\r\nFails to compile because it does not recognize the flag..."
