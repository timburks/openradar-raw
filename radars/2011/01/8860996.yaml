    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMac App Store Preview URLs on itunes.apple.com do not convert text descriptions for Mac apps into HTML. For example, returns inside the description to improve formatting are not shown, forcing all the text to run together. For iOS apps on iTunes Preview, it does correctly convert to HTML.\r\n\r\nThis makes the preview web pages look wrong and difficult to read for users, especially when bulleted lists are used (common in App Store descriptions).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Visit http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clipstart/id404097625?mt=12 in Safari.\r\n* Notice that all the text runs together, ignoring returns.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nText should be formatted as the developer intended, with return characters converted to HTML \"br\" tags so that they look good in a web browser.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis works correctly for iOS apps. The formatting problem seems specific to Mac apps. The difference can be confirmed by viewing source on an iTunes Preview page for an iOS app and comparing it to the HTML source for a Mac App Store app.\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a screenshot showing both the Mac App Store app (left) and Preview web page in Safari (right) side by side for the same application."
