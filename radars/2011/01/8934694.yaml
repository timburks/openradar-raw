    description: "Summary: The App Store will not show updates as available (\"All apps are up to date\" in the Updates tab). The purchases tab shows the purchased products and the \"Installed\" button is a dark grey \"Update\" button instead. When the button is pressed a message appears: \"You have updates available for other accounts\r\nSign in to (null) to update applications for that account.\"\r\n\r\nThe console log showed a warning for mds that corresponded to times when the App Store was in operation.\r\n\r\n(Warning) Server: No stores registered for metascope \"kMDQueryScopeComputer\"\r\n\r\nI removed \"Macintosh HD\" from the Privacy tab of Spotlight Preferences, allowed it to finish indexing, and the App Store works as expected. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add root drive to Spotlight Privacy.\r\n2. delete .Spotlight-V100 from the root of the drive\r\n3. Open App Store, check for updates. If no apps installed, download a free app, wait for it to update (TextWrangler and Twitter have both had many, so good choices), then attempt to update.\r\n4. No luck. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. The App Store should not rely on Spotlight to know which apps or installed OR not fail if Spotlight is disabled. Isn't there a manifest of purchased items?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nInability to update without deleting and reinstalling the apps entirely (a process which works, but is annoying). Inability to not have Spotlight indexing and App Store purchases at the same time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSince day 2 of the app store - unknown if that was the same version/build no.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nmds and mdworker were constantly thrashing my drive and I never used Spotlight. If I have to have Spotlight on to use the App Store I am less likely to purchase through it."
