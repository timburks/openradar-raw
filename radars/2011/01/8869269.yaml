    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe \"Test the Installation Process\" section of the \"Submitting to the Mac App Store\" document is incomplete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions on the developer web site:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/documents/submitting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010572-CH16-SW7\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should have enough information to install and launch your application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe instructions only test that the installer package can be read and written to the Applications folder. Developers will also want to run their applications prior to submission to iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe documentation should mention that the installation process can fail if duplicate copies of the app are present elsewhere on the system (e.g. in the build folder.)\r\n\r\nThe documentation should also mention that sandbox users accounts can be created in iTunes Connect (under Manage Users.) These user names and passwords can then be entered after launching the installed application and a receipt will be generated in the application's _MASReceipt folder. In order for this launch test to work, the app metadata must be defined in iTunes Connect (a binary does not need to be uploaded, it only needs to show up in \"Manage Your Apps\".)"
