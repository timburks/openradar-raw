    description: "Summary: When the user sends a text message they need a cellular connection. If a cellular connection is not available, presenting a MFMessageComposeViewController and the user clicking send, will result in the message not being sent. The message compose view controller should know that it cannot send the message and tell the user, or application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Turn on airplane mode. Attempt to send a message from a third party application using MFMessageComposeViewController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Message is sent to the recipient(s) over the cellular network.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Message is not sent. The application thinks the message is sent.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: This would be much better for developers instead of them having to determine network availability (such as for data connections.)\r\n\r\n27-Apr-2012 04:45 PM Joe Pasqualetti |||:\r\nRereading the documentation the MessageComposeResult’s successful flag says “MessageComposeResultSent\r\nThe user successfully queued or sent the message.” I am closing my bug as the API is serving its documented purpose.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
