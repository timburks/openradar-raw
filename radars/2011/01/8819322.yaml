    description: "[Attached sample project: http://cl.ly/2j2S0L0d1U2J0k0v3847 ]\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a UIResponder's implementation of -canPerformAction:withSender: is conditional, [[UIMenuController sharedMenuController] update] does not take into account the new return values. The menu remains unupdated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached sample project and run it. Tap the Menu button, then Select All. Notice that the menu contents don't update.\r\n- Tap outside the menu to hide it, then tap the Menu button again. The Delete option now appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The Delete button should appear as soon as the Select All button is tapped."
