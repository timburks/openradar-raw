    description: "Summary:\r\nWe need a scriptable way to install iOS apps on local device for automated testing.\r\n\r\nWe build a whole bunch of things on a Mac Mini server and we would like to copy those apps onto an iPhone/iPod/iPad and run through a unit test suite we developed.\r\n\r\nRight now, we don't have a good way of automating this.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to have a command line interface.\r\n\r\nWe would also be willing to settle for a ScriptingBridge way.\r\n\r\nI'm experimenting with ScriptingBridge to tell Xcode to install and run these things. So far, the best I've been able to do is have an Xcode project call debug on an active executable which launches the app on the device. This isn't bad, but we were hoping we could do better. \r\n\r\nOne problem is that the apps we are running are already prebuilt and don't necessarily have a Xcode project immediately on hand to open. We were hoping we might be able to forgo the opening of the Xcode project, and instead just install an app via the Xcode Organizer or something since we already have built the apps. But I can't find anything in the ScriptingBridge dictionary about Xcode Organizer."
