    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 3.2.5 the \"default\" template for creating an AB Action Plug-In won't work \"out of the box\", since the default architecture is \"32 bits\". \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Xcode 3.2.5, New Project, Address Book Action Plug-In, Compile, move the \".bundle\" file in \"Library/Address Book Plug-Ins\", start Address Book\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Speak: \" action should appear on a telephone number.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing appears.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm guessing it worked in Leopard. Didn't tested, but watching the WWDC 2007 Session Video shows it working.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you add \"Address Book.app\" as a Custom Executable, it works. Also, if you start Address Book.app in 32 Bit (what the debugger actually does) it works.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be correctly set to \"32/64 Bits\" in Xcode 4 Preview 5, but if you guys intend to release a next Xcode 3 release, please ship the simple fix for the template."
