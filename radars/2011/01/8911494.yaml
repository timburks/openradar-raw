    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen submitting apps for review and subsequent approval to the Mac App Store, I am finding that the App Store review process frequently hangs for weeks at a time, and there is no UI to indicate any form of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Submit an app for review.\r\n2. Wait for a week.\r\n3. Wait some more.\r\n4. No, keep waiting.\r\n5. Get rejected.\r\n6. See step 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApp is reviewed in a fast and efficient manner. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApp review process stalls at all points in the process, with no user interface to indicate there is a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSome form of UI to indicate the progress of the indeterminate wait would help, but honestly I think somebody needs to run the review process through Instruments.app.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, and this is a joke :) I know you guys are working hard."
