    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a Keynote (Fullscreen)\r\n2. Have the slide play a few animations (staying on the slide)\r\n3. Cmd-Tab to another App, staying in Full Screen in Keynote\r\n4. Cmd-Tab back to Keynote\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Slide should be were it was when I left (a.k.a. at Animation 3 for example)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSlide \"restarted\" at the beginning.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a major bummer for me :( Probably the main reason why Apple uses 2 machines during WWDC, and makes me haveing to use 2 machines as well."
