    description: "There is no nice (or is it even official?) way of detecting and handling the media keys on the user's keyboard. One can intercept events with type NSSystemDefined and subtype 8 in -[NSApplication sendEvents:], but this has major problem: any other applications that listen to the media keys will receive these events too. This means for example that if only Spotify is running and you want to pause your music, iTunes will start when you press play/pause. If you have VLC running in the background, it will also start playing.\r\n\r\nApple has solved this problem internally by having their media key using applications cooperate and resign media key controls to the application that was in the foreground most recently. However, there is no way for third party applications to join this cooperation. I request an API to expose media key nicely, together with an API to get exclusive usage of media keys, given that you were the latest application registered as such to be active.\r\n\r\nI have implemented a workaround that does this using a CGEventTap at https://gist.github.com/764542. However, the class of events being captured is too broad and might cause problems with third party applications (we've already noticed Adobe Fireworks misbehaving when the tap is in place)."
