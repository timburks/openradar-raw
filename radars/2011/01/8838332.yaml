    description: "Summary:\r\nMail.app does not save reply-to data when e-mails in the application are moved from the inbox to folders. For an illustration of this, see the attached Screen Grab which is a composite image of two screen grabs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect to some IMAP server, e.g. Gmail.\r\n2. Reply to an e-mail in the inbox, see the arrow appear that indicates you have replied to this e-mail.\r\n3. Move the e-mail from the inbox to any other folder, watch how the arrow disappears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe arrow should still be there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe arrow (and perhaps data) relating to the reply are deleted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has been tested with four configurations: \r\n1. Intel iMac with 10.6.5 installed.\r\n2. Intel iMac with 10.6.6 installed.\r\n3. Intel MacBook with 10.6.5 installed.\r\n4. Intel MacBook with 10.6.6 installed\r\n\r\nAll the above configurations exhibit the behaviour.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
