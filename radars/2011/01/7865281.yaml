    description: "14-Apr-2010 03:08 PM W Lewis:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way to adjust the baseline of a span of text using the iPad's (iPhone's) CoreText implementation.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nOne of our users' most requested features would require us to lay out text with superscripts and subscripts. CoreText has a kCTSuperscriptAttributeName attribute, but there are two problems with this:\r\n  1. It says it only works \"If supported by the specified font\", and none of the fonts shipping on the iPad appear to support it. Even if some did, there is apparently no way for a program to detect whether a given font supports superscript/subscript.\r\n  2. It only accepts values <-1, 0, 1>. While this is sufficient for many uses (or would be, if it had any effect) it would be even more useful to have a means for applying an arbitrary vertical offset to the glyphs in a run. We can apply the usual reduced font size ourselves when doing multiple super/sub scripts and so on.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt would be rather nice if CoreText were written in a more object-oriented, extensible style."
