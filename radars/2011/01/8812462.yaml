    description: "Summary:\r\nDouble-tapping the Home button to quickly adjust brightness (like on the iPad) isn’t possible on iPhone and iPod touch. Instead the user has to leave the app, navigate to the Settings app, drill down to the Brightness slider, and find back to the previous app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Double-tap the Home button\r\n2) Flick two pages to the left\r\n3) Possibly attempt flicking another page\r\n4) No brightness slider is available\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA brightness slider on page two or three.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJust the volume slider.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHaving the volume slider present in the task switcher is of very limited value, since the user can even easier use the existing hardware buttons on the side. Instead of offering two ways of quickly adjusting the volume (not counting the switch on the earbuds), and none for adjusting brightness, it would be more efficient and user friendly to offer a brightness slider in the switcher instead of the volume slider."
