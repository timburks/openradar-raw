    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Mac App Store shows some apps as \"Installed\" even though they were not bought from the App Store. Due to this, app store users think it will 'pick up on' those apps and manage updates for them.\r\n\r\nYou know all this, but please see my \"Notes\" section before you close this as a dupe.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Quit Mac App Store app if running\r\n1. Download Transmit (by Panic, from their website)\r\n2. Open Mac App Store\r\n3. Find Transmit in Mac App Store\r\n4. Note appearance of \"price/free/buy/installed\" (hereinafter \"p/f/b/i\") button next to Transmit in app store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\"p/f/b/i\" button should show price, allowing users to buy the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\"p/f/b/i\" button shows \"Installed\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAny Mac app that uses the same bundle identifier and version number for both a 'sideloaded' version as well as one available through the app store will exhibit this problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- You want to be able to use the same bundle identifier as sideloaded versions of apps, e.g. so preferences migrate transparently, and apps that integrate with eachother by finding eachother through NSWorkspace don't have to special case different versions of these apps.\r\n- You don't want the sideloaded app to show up in the Mac App Store as \"Installed\", developer blogs everywhere show evidence (in comments sections) that customers massively assume this means the app store will 'pick up on it'.\r\n- Every app store app has a Receipt in it. If you add a check for that file just being present (no verification needed, as this is not about piracy but about the user experience well-intentioned users experience and the repercussions for developers if it stays broken like this) before showing the app as \"Installed\" everything would be better.\r\n\r\nSuggested Criteria to validate that an app is installed:\r\n\r\n1. App has same bundle identifier\r\n2. App has a version number that has ever existed in the app store\r\n3. App bundle contains a \"_MASReceipt\" folder in its \"Contents\" folder"
