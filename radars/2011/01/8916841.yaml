    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a Pages doc exported to PDF, small text looks blocky and poorly antialiased.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Pages 4.0.5 from iWork '09\r\n2. New blank document\r\n3. Change font to Helvetica Neue 8 pt using the font panel\r\n4. Type \"Helvetica Neue 8\" and press the return key\r\n5. Change font to Helvetica Neue 9 pt\r\n6. Type \"Helvetica Neue 9\"\r\n7. File -> Print, then PDF -> Open PDF in Preview\r\n8. Note quality of the text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected the text to look good on both lines.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n8 pt text looks blocky, even when zoomed in.  9 pt text is fine.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks correctly in TextEdit and MS Word.\r\nWorks incorrectly in Pages 3.0.3 (iWork '08).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBug was seen on the internet:\r\nhttp://ask.metafilter.com/176693/Improving-Pages-09-PDF-Export-Quality\r\n\r\nIf you change the system font-smoothing threshold value, the bug goes away.  (In System Prefs, Appearance pane, change \"Turn off text smoothing for font sizes X and smaller\" from 8 to 6.)\r\n\r\nThis seems to indicate that Pages is turning off text smoothing for the small text. It should be doing it only for on-screen display, but (as seen in this bug) it is doing that when printing too."
