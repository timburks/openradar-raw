    description: "Steps to Reproduce:Do a bulk insertion of table cells into a table. Perform another bulk insertion of table cells before the animation completes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:Additional table cells will be shown animating in after the initial ones do.\r\n\r\nActual Results:All animations are terminated.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:This can be made a lot easier to deal with by adding a new method to the UITableViewDelegate protocol that is strictly intended to notify the delegate that an insertion/deletion animation has completed. The delegate can use this information to queue up any additional table edits until the previous ones have completed."
