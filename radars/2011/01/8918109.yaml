    description: "Summary:\r\nConfiguring a Group Calendar (i.e. one that multiple people in a team can write to) is much harder than it should be. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a MacOS X Server install with a number of registered users (A, B and C). \r\n2. Start iCal Server.\r\n3. For users A, B and C, configure iCal on their local machines to access their calendars on the server, using iCal's new account wizard.\r\n4. Go to the OSX Server's web address and create a new wiki. Add users A, B and C to the edit permissions.\r\n5. Still in the web interface, go to Settings within this new wiki.\r\n6. Enable \"Calendar\" and save changes. This wiki now has a calendar associated with it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor any of users A, B or C, in iCal, the new group calendar automatically appears under the \"user@server.com\" account on the sidebar. All calendars on this Mac server that the user has permission to view should appear there, with their personal calendar at the top, followed by shared calendars.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new group calendar does not appear in the sidebar. Adding it requires the cryptic step of adding a new account in iCal, with the same username and password, then going and amending \"Server path\" to be \"/principals/__uids__/wiki-<name>/\". This step is poorly documented and should not be required.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIdeally I'd also like a better way for creating the group calendars: creating a wiki was not the most intuitive way to do that. (Perhaps rename the wiki feature to Groups?) However, I can put up with that one. It's the crazy backwards way of adding the group calendar to iCal that I object to. I've now got two accounts for the same server in my iCal accounts list, which is counterintuitive in itself, and one of them I had to edit a path to be a string I only found from googling the problem."
