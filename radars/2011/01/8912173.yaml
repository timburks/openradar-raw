    description: "We experience increasingly biased reviews originating from promo code downloads. Contrary to section 3.10 of the App Store Review Guidelines many developers are using such tactics to get a better rating. It's our (and the whole developer community's) understanding that a better rating positively influences search relevance on the App Store.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there are various services that offer the trading of promo codes against (presumably positive) reviews.\r\n\r\nhttp://promodispenser.com (there's even an app on the App Store, don't understand how that could be approved)\r\nhttp://tobiasbischoff.com/2011/01/die-appstore-review-mafia-informiert/\r\n\r\nSince promo codes are redeemable world-wide, the problem is even more severe now.\r\n\r\nIn the past, we tried to work with Apple Legal to highlight such cases of smelly reviews. Unfortunately, the legal dept. has been very unresponsive at this matter (no result after 3 months).\r\n\r\nTo us it looks like section 3.10 is not enforced at all. Unenforced rules however convey abuse. Honest developers (like ourselves) are \"punished\" if they continue to play fair and don't incorporate these shady practices in their marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur proposed solution is to remove and prevent all ratings and reviews from the App Store that are made by promo code downloads. This would be a clear rule and would be a logical continuation of the \"review-only-if-purchased\" policy that was introduced a while back."
