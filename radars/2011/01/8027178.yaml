    description: "25-May-2010 03:27 PM W Lewis:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n-[UITextInputStringTokenizer positionFromPosition:toBoundary:inDirection:], with granularity=Word, gets the directions 'forward' and 'backward' reversed sometimes.\r\n\r\nSentence granularity seems to have a similar problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Invoke -positionFromPosition:toBoundary:inDirection: with a granularity of UITextGranularityWord and direction UITextStorageDirectionForward or UITextStorageDirectionBackward, starting from various locations in a piece of text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf passing UITextStorageDirectionForward, the returned position will be in the 'forward' direction relative to the starting position; if passing UITextStorageDirectionBackward, the position will be in the 'backward' direction relative to the starting position\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOrdering of the positions is inconsistent, depending apparently on whether the supplied position is in the interior of a word or not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBehaves the same on my device (3.2 7B367) and the simulator.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nCompile and run the program I will be attaching to this bug report. You'll need to run it either in the simulator or on an ipad with a hardware keyboard available, because the stripped-down text editor in the program does not have any way to move the insertion point other than reacting to the arrow keys.\r\n\r\nThe program is a slightly modified version of the editor attached to RADARs 7881864 and 7914098. It draws the insertion point as a vertical red line, and the positions returned from UITextInputStringTokenizer as small angled marks.\r\n\r\nOn launch you will see the insertion point at the beginning of the word 'well', and angle marks surrounding the word (and the space before it). This is as expected.\r\n\r\nUse the arrow keys to move the insertion point back and forth and note the behavior of the angle marks as you do so. Note that when the insertion point is in the *middle* of a word, the marks are in the right locations but are swapped (e.g., the Forward mark is where the Backward mark should be and vise versa). When the insertion point is at a word boundary or in the middle of a stretch of non-word text, the marks are correctly ordered.\r\n\r\nYou can try changing the granularity (lines 150 and 151 in -[MinimalTextEditor drawRect:]) to observe other granularities' behaviors. The character granularity appears to behave correctly. The sentence granularity exhibits a bug analogous to the word granularity's bug. I haven't investigated others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25-May-2010 03:33 PM W Lewis:\r\n'UITextInputTokenizer-8027178.tar.gz' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n25-May-2010 03:33 PM W Lewis:\r\nSample application demonstrating the problem\r\n\r\n04-Jan-2011 11:17 AM W Lewis:\r\nProblem persists unchanged in iOS 4.2 (at least in the simulator).\r\n\r\n18-Jan-2011 03:32 PM W Lewis:\r\nProblem fixed in 4.3-seed (8F5148b)."
