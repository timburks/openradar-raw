    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS devices (iPhone and iPad), calling usleep() consumes a significantly large amount of CPU time when on a background thread. usleep generally should be nicer to the processor.\r\n\r\nIn the open source library ALmixer (attached), there is a worker thread that is created to do some state management bookkeeping. Often, it does not need to actually do anything, so to be nice to the processor, I call usleep(10) to yield the thread. This works on all other systems I've tried (Mac OS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD), but on iOS, I discovered that a large amount of time is being spent in usleep.\r\n\r\nFor programs that are near maxing out the CPU, this usleep() causes a pathological performance problem. Applications begin to start stuttering as it seems that this background thread keeps waking up.\r\n\r\nTo work around the problem, I change the pthread priority. I discovered that the default was 31 which is the highest or next highest priority. To improve the performance of my program, I had to lower the priority all the way to the lowest (0 I think). Small values above the lowest did not improve the performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a demo program. It is a simple OpenGL template that activates my background thread. Run the app on a device in Instruments with the Time Profiler. You will see a huge amount of time spent in usleep() called on my worker thread.\r\n\r\nThere is not enough stuff going on in this program to see stuttering. If you could find a stressful program, you would probably see stuttering.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nusleep should not be sucking up all the CPU.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCPU is eaten by usleep.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSeems to always have been bad.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn ALmixer.c, look for:\r\n#if 0 // DISABLED FOR APPLE BUG DEMONSTRATION\r\n\r\nIf you enable this, you'll enable my thread priority code which sets the level to 0 and the CPU cost goes down significantly.\r\n\r\nAlso attached is a saved Instruments trace."
