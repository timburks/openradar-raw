    description: "26-May-2009 12:15 PM David Wheeler:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen exporting a presentation with a build triggered by a transition, using the option \"Print each stage of builds,\" slides are exported as PDF pages that are blank.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Create a new presentation in Keynote '09 using the \"White\" template (choice of template does not matter).\r\n* Double-click the title text box and type \"Whatever\".\r\n* Select the title text box and open the Build inspector.\r\n* Select an effect and click the \"More Options\" button.\r\n* Select the title object in the \"Build Order\" drawer.\r\n* In the \"Start Build\" select list, select \"Automatically after transition\"\r\n* From the \"Share\" menu, select \"PDF\".\r\n* Make sure that the \"Print each stage of builds\" option is selected.\r\n* Click \"Nextâ€¦\" and save the PDF to your desktop.\r\n* Open the presentation in Preview.app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA one page PDF with the title on it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA two-page PDF, with the first page blank and the title on the second page.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI expect that this issue goes back to when the \"Automatically after transition\" option was added to the build inspector a few versions back.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt seems smart to export each transition as its own slide when the \"Print each stage of builds\" option is selected, but it's annoying for builds triggered automatically after a slide transition. This screams for an option *not* to put such automatically-triggered builds on their own slides."
