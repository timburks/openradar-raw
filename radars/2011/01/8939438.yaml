    description: "31-Jan-2011 03:09 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOn a WiFi iPad, the time of day drifts, resulting in inaccurate time information. This drift may not be worse than on other computers, but the iPad seems unique in that it apparently does not make any attempt to correct the date via NTP or other means.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGet an iPad. Make sure the time is set correctly. Use it on and off for a week or two. Note that the device time is no longer correct.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhile drift is inherent in computer clocks, dealing with this has long been a solved problem. I would expect that the iPad would be able to match other Apple devices in keeping its time accurate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\niPad time will become inaccurate without periodic manual fixes by the user.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis problem also exists on a WiFi iPad running iOS 3.2.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n03-Feb-2011 01:17 PM Tom Harrington:\r\n[I was asked to send a console log]\r\n\r\nI have attached the requested log.\r\n\r\nI don't know what steps I could take to reproduce the problem. The time of day is incorrect on the iPad, and it's not getting corrected. Would you want me to try setting it to some other time?\r\n\r\nThe last entry in the attached log is at 13:21:10. At that time my Mac indicated the current time was 13:13:55. The Mac is configured to set its date and time automatically. The iPad does not appear to have the option to set its time automatically, which results in the time being inaccurate as described previously.\r\n\r\n[Bug was marked as a duplicate of 8714700]"
