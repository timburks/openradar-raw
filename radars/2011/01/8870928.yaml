    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAs of today it is not possible to use AudioServicesPlaySystemSound (kSystemSoundID_Vibrate) in a beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler block.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't allow to inform the user a task has been finished. Sometimes a local notification is too much, for example for a Mail client. You don't want to notify the user with a notification when all new emails have been downloaded, you just want to shake the device like the Mail.app."
