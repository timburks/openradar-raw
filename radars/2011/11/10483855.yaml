    description: "23-Nov-2011 12:54 PM Terin Stock:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n  * There is currently no method for the sharing/marshaling of the media key events (generated by hitting the rewind, play/pause and forward keys (F7-F9) on an Apple keyboard) across applications.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n  * API to share the media keys between applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n  * Each application must implement own handling of events, to the determent of all others\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n10-Apr-2012 01:28 PM Terin Stock:\r\nAs we move to sandboxed applications, the need for this API is even greater.\r\n\r\nWhile one can still respond to the media keys by implementing -[NSApplication sendEvent:], sandboxed applications can not implement a CGEventTap (listening for NX_KEYTYPE_PLAY, NX_KEYTYPE_FAST and NX_KEYTYPE_REWIND).\r\n\r\nWithout CGEventTap or an official media key API, there is no way to coordinate access to these keys between applications so that pressing play in my application won't start iTunes or another application using media keys. In addition, it is not possible to use the media keys while your application is not active, the most common use case.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I request a status update regarding this issue."
