    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen bringing in a new library build errors are often the result of build settings that need to be modified for the project. It would be convenient to enable the project or target icon shown in the issue navigator to open project settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build a project with errors\r\n2. Select a project or target in the issue navigator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSettings for the project or target are displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing happens. Developer is sad."
