    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter an app returns from the background, a fullscreen UIView's hitTest:withEvent method will fire for touches that should be going to the on screen keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Subclass UIView as MyView and override hitTest:withEvent: to log when it is called.\r\n- Create an app with 2 views:\r\n  - 1 Fullscreen MyView (768x1024)\r\n  - 1 UITextView (200x200) in the center of the MyView, as a subview\r\n\r\n- Launch the app.\r\n- Tap the textfield.\r\n  - You will see hitTest logged the touch event. The textfield became first responder and the keyboard appeared.  Tapping elsewhere in the fullscreen view will log similar events.\r\n- Tap on the keyboard.\r\n  - You will see that hitTest does not log these touch events. Characters appear in the textfield.\r\n- Dimiss the keyboard.\r\n- Send the app to the background.\r\n- Resume the app.\r\n- Tap the textview to make it first responder.\r\n  - You will see hitTest logged the touch event. The textfield became first responder and the keyboard appeared.\r\n- Tap on the keyboard.\r\n  - You will see that now hitTest DOES log these touch events. Characters appear in the textfield.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMyView's hitTest should be called consistently for touches to the keyboard whether the app has been in the background or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMyView's hitTest is called inconsistently.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnsure, see notes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven't been able to test this on earlier versions of iOS.  This behavior is only apparent on device so I could not reproduce it in earlier versions of the simulator."
