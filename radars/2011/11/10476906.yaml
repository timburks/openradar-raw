    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApplications that are sandboxed cannot access game controllers even when USB (com.apple.security.device.usb) entitlement is specified.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDownload HID sample code http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/HID_Explorer/Introduction/Intro.html . Build it, add sandboxing and USB entitlements. Sign and run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAll connected HID devices (including game controllers) should be enumerated in application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSandbox denies access to HID devices and sample application crashes (crash of course could be fixed, but still no  HID devices can be accessed).\r\n\r\nHID_Explorer(12897) deny iokit-open IOHIDLibUserClient\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWhen the attached application is run without sandboxing enabled, it was able to access all HID devices (including game controllers) just fine."
