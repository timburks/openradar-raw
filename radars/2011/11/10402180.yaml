    description: "When Siri is set to english, it has trouble pronouncing foreign names. While Siri adheres to what is written in the pronunciation field in contacts, some phones cannot easily be entered, such as the soft German ch sound (as in my Name, Friedrich): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_palatal_fricative\r\n\r\nWhile only few languages have this phone, one of them is German (relatively important, I think), and the sound is far from uncommon in the German language.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to write or paste IPA symbols into the pronunciation field and have Siri adhere to them (pasting is possible, but Siri interprets the signs in a strange way).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry and get my name to be pronounced correctly by an english Siri.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMore or less correct pronunciation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nGerman Siri has no problem with the sound, but I have been unable to convince english-speaking Siri to utter it. I've tried various spellings such as \"Freedrych\", \"Freedrygh\", \"Freedryjh\", \"Freedrish\", \"Freedri√ß\" (the last one uses the correct IPA sign pasted from Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nThis trial-and-error game getting Siri (and the older voice dialer) to pronounce something right could be avoided if we could write or paste IPA, or if there were a way to specify language. This would also be nice for music. Especially non English speaking people will probably have a lot of english and some local music, and this just doesn't work well when the system tries to pronounce or understand titles."
