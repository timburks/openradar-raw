    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you are listening to something at either 2x or 1/2x in the Music app, and there is an interruption (I have observed phone calls and use of Siri), after the interruption is complete, the audio will continue, but at 1x speed. The UI continues to show the original (non-1x) speed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Start the Music app\r\n2) Play an audiobook or a podcast at 2x (or 1/2x) speed\r\n3) Activate Siri -or- take a phone call.   Either way, the audio will stop until step 3 is complete.\r\n4) When audio resumes, it will be at 1x speed, but the screen will show 2x (or 1/2x)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio should resume at the speed it was originally playing."
