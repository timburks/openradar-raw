    description: "24-Nov-2011 11:56 AM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere is currently no sample code publicly available for UIManagedDocument, and the documentation seems quite obtuse in places (refer to UIDocument, where UIDocument also provides no detail on how to approach issues).\r\n\r\nFurther, the templates for this have been removed from Xcode 4.2.x. \r\n\r\nShould we not be using UIManagedDocument yet?"
