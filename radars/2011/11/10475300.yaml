    description: "20-Nov-2011 10:29 AM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI use tools such as uncrustify (http://uncrustify.sf.net/) to automatically format source code while I'm working so that my code is always consistently formatted. It would be great if Xcode could provide this feature out of the box, with some limited control over the way that the formatting occurs.\r\n\r\nOther source code \"cleanliness\" features such as stripping trailing whitespace should be done automatically as well.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to elaborate further, but automatic source code formatting would be a huge boon to Xcode as an editor!\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration :)"
