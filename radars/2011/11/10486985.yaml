    description: "25-Nov-2011 11:13 AM Joachim Bengtsson:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen terminating your iOS application running in the simulator (e g by pressing cmd-R to run it again after a code fix), Xcode catches the signal, figures out what code is currently running, switches the current editor to that code, and looks like it's about to throw me into the debugger, until half a second later the process is correctly killed. This means that I have to navigate to the previous source file in my history hundreds of times every time.\r\n\r\nI've disabled ALL Behaviors, and I still get this."
