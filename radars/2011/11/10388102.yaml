    description: "Summary:\r\nI've been working with DTS trying to use CAOpenGLLayer effectively. (Follow-Up: 165216028)\r\n\r\nI am rendering to an offscreen FBO and trying to then render it in the drawInContext: callback of CAOpenGLLayer. This works perfectly fine on for me except when there is no display connected to the Mac. In the headless Mac case, I get no rendering/\r\n\r\nDTS seems to think this is a specific bug to CAOpenGLLayer (but not NSOpenGLView) and asked me to file a bug.\r\n\r\nWith my real program, I do notice that on Lion, if I kick into fullscreen mode, I start to get things rendered. Also, if I do weird things to my window (programatic reshape) which force complicated redraws in my engine, I sometimes get a single frame rendered to the screen which then remains stuck until I do it again or switch to fullscreen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a demo program DTS originally sent to me. It is tweaked a little, but I think it is mostly the same and never worked with offscreen rendering. I was hoping to reproduce the Lion fullscreen effect with it, but was not able to. Still, I think you will be able to see the fundamental drawing problem. It should draw a spinning diamond on the screen under normal circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem, detach all displays from your computer. (I use a Mac Mini mid 2010.) \r\nThen reboot. \r\nThen run the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should see a spinning diamond.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI think you either see a black window or a red window. I can't remember which. I think the color might be the glClearColor.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBoth Snow Leopard and Lion have problems.\r\nOn Snow Leopard, my pixel format is rejected if I request accelerated and no recovery, and omit kCGLPFARemotePBuffer and my programs eventually crash, but it is accepted on Lion. On Snow Leopard, if I try a fallback with kCGLPFARemotePBuffer (instructed by DTS), I avoid a crash, but get no rendering.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
