    description: "17-Jul-2011 03:52 PM John Brayton:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMy app, CloudPull (http://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/), creates a login item for itself after asking the user for permission.  This is important because CloudPull performs backups.  It can only perform backups when running.\r\n\r\nIt seems that sandboxed apps have no ability to create login items for themselves.  This is my assumption because my LSSharedFileList API calls fail when the app is sandboxed, I have not seen documentation for how sandboxed apps should add login items for themselves, and my devforums question on the topic has gone unanswered.\r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/473934\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Write an app to add a login item for itself using the LSSharedFileList API.\r\n2.  Sandbox the app.\r\n3.  Watch the LSSharedFileList API calls fail. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf there is an alternative API or approach I should be using, I am open to suggestions.  Thanks."
