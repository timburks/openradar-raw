    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen hiding and showing the status bar, a view won't auto-resize to fit the new area by removing and adding it back to the window until the window has been rotated at least once. Attached is a sample project that demonstrates the issue. Run it and tap the button on the screen. If you haven't rotated, the view doesn't resize. If you rotate, and then tap the button, the view will resize correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Hide status bar\r\n\r\n2. Remove current view from key window\r\n\r\n3. Add view back to key Window to force resize \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe view now fills the the entire screen even if the device hasn't been rotated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe view doesn't resize leaving the area previously occupied by the status bar *unless* the device has been rotated at least once. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone that I'm aware of\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nThe remove view/add view was something I discovered while looking around for how to make the view resize. Previously I had tried to move and resize the UIWindow when hiding and showing the status bar. The problem here is that after rotation, the window is now moved an additional amount equal to the width of the status bar."
