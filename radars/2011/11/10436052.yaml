    description: "Summary: iTunes displays a modal dialog \"Looking for [Device]\", where [Device] is either iPhone/iPod/iPad, when starting Wi-Fi sync from iTunes. Per the definition of a modal dialog, iTunes becomes unusable for period when iTunes looks for the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Wi-Fi sync for a device.\r\n2. Make sure that the device is not connected via the USB cable.\r\n3. Find the device in the iTunes sidebar.\r\n4. Click Sync.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: iTunes silently starts to sync, displaying the progress in the status area at the top of the window.\r\n\r\nActual Results: iTunes displays a modal window with the text \"Looking for [Device\" accompanied by an indeterminate progress bar for the first few seconds of the sync. There is no way to dismiss this window.\r\n\r\nRegression: When using USB sync, looking for the device on the network doesn't happen, so the sync experience is not interrupted by a modal window.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
