    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode nudges users towards using $DERIVED_FILE_DIR (…/$CONFIGURATION/target.build/DerivedSources/) as the output file for script phases. However, there doesn’t seem to be a supported way to add references to files in this directory in a configuration-neutral manner.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new project. (example attached)\r\n* Add a new shell script build phase with a script like:\r\n        mkdir -p \"$DERIVED_FILE_DIR\"\r\n        cd \"$DERIVED_FILE_DIR\"\r\n        \r\n        echo \"#include <stdio.h>\" > DoSomething.c\r\n        echo \"void DoSomething(void) { printf(\\\"Hello, world\\n\\\"); }\" >> DoSomething.c\r\n* Build the project.\r\n* Add the generated file to the project.\r\n* Clean the project, then build a different configuration (e.g., using Build for Archive).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* The file should be generated and compiled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* The file is generated in the active configuration’s DerivedSources directory, but compilation fails because the reference points to a file in the wrong configuration’s DerivedSources directory.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown; I’ve used this type of arrangement in Xcode 3, but I can’t remember if I had trouble setting it up.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy solution was to manually edit the project file to replace the configuration name in the reference with $CONFIGURATION. Ideally, adding a reference to a file in a DerivedSources directory (for any target/configuration combination in the project) would add a configuration-neutral reference, either by using a path with $CONFIGURATION in it or by adding a DerivedSources-relative sourceTree."
