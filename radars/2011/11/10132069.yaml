    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter building a target, subsequent builds of the same target do not perform preprocessing of the target's Info.plist file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an iOS application project.\r\n- Create a file in the same directory as the .xcodeproj file named 'InfoPlist.h', with contents:\r\n#define FOOBAR Hello\r\n- In the target build settings check 'Preprocess Info.plist File'.\r\n- In the target build settings set 'Info.plist Preprocessor Prefix File' to 'InfoPlist.h'.\r\n- In the project's Info.plist file add a new row with key: 'foobar' and value: 'FOOBAR'.\r\n- Build the project.\r\n- Find the Info.plist in the resulting app bundle.  Note that the value for the 'foobar' key is 'Hello'.\r\n- Edit 'InfoPlist.h' to have contents:\r\n#define FOOBAR Goodbye\r\n- Build the project.\r\n- Find the Info.plist in the resulting app bundle. Note that the value for the 'foobar' key is 'Hello'.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the last step above, the value for the 'foobar' key should be 'Goodbye'.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value for the 'foobar' key is still 'Hello'.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn Xcode 3.2.6 preprocessing is performed every time a target is built so the 'foobar' key is always updated to contain the correct value.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPerforming a Clean and then building again causes the correct value to be embedded in the Info.plist file.  But subsequent builds repeat the same problem, until a Clean is performed again."
