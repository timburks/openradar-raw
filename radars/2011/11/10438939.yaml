    description: "Summary: iPod touch 4th generation cannot recognize touch input for the first few seconds after Sliding to Unlock, when on the same local area network as the computer running iTunes with which it syncs over Wi-Fi.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\niTunes 10.5 (141)\r\niOS 5.0.1 (9A405)\r\nMac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74)\r\niPod touch 4th generation\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that the iPod touch is set to sync with iTunes over Wi-Fi.\r\n2. Make sure iTunes is open on the Mac and that the iPod touch is visible in the iTunes sidebar.\r\n3. Make sure that the iPod touch is at the home screen, then lock it and let it sleep.\r\n4. After an indeterminate period of time (presumably, enough time for the iPod to disconnect from the network), wake up the iPod by pressing the home button and Slide to Unlock.\r\n5. Immediately attempt to open an app by pressing on the corresponding icon on the home screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The app icon should indicate a touch event by becoming dark and should open immediately.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Touch input is accepted but responses are delayed for approx. 3-5 seconds after the device is unlocked. No touch inputs visibly register until after these 3-5 seconds, after which the device attempts to \"catch up\" and perform all previous touch inputs.\r\n\r\nRegression: This problem never occurs when iTunes Wi-Fi sync is turned off, and it never occurred in iOS 4.x.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
