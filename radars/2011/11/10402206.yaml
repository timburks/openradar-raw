    description: 'Siri would become immensely more useful and magical if developers were allowed to plug in somehow. Several use cases come to mind, a simple one being: Allow Siri to launch apps with "command-line" parameters. Another one could be Apps registering as search providers for Siri, so when the user asks "what''s next on my to-do list", registered to-do list apps get queried, or when the user asks for a translation, registered translation/dictionary apps get queried.'
