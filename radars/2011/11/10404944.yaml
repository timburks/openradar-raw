    description: "this is a request for the XIB file format to get documented - it is currently undocumented and changes without warning with new Xcode and/or Mac OS X versions.\r\n\r\nthere are many reasons to be able to reliably parse the XIB file format:\r\n • using XIB files for deploying mac apps to windows/linux (gnustep / cocotron)\r\n • developing advanced mac development tools for e.g. localization, testing, ...\r\n\r\nthe XIB file format also violates some of the standards it uses, e.g. it uses base64 strings which do not exceed the minimum length."
