    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes (most of the time) when attempting to make outgoing calls on my iPhone 4S no audio is heard through the earpiece.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo into the phone application. \r\nDial a number on the keypad. \r\nPress Call. \r\nHold handset to hear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHear phone ringing and then someone saying \"Hello\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo audio. Sometimes able to recover the audio by manually toggling from earpiece to speaker and back. Sometimes audio gets stuck on speaker and will not move to other output. \r\n\r\nSimilar issue with headset plugged in. When dialling the number, audio is heard as the numbers are pressed. Once call starts, audio is routed out the speaker and cannot be moved onto the headset.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis issue was also present for me on the iOS5 GM as shipped with the phone, but continues to be present in iOS 5.0.1 beta2.\r\n\r\nMany other people experiencing the same issue:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3404857"
