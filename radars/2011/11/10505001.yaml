    description: "In Xcode, I think it would be useful (for notes, bug reports, etc.) to be able to easily copy the current location to the clipboard in a text-based format.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I wanted to reference some code in an email, I could control-click in the gutter of the Xcode source editor (on the line number I wanted to copy), and I could select \"Copy file location\". The clipboard would then have \"main.m:10\".\r\n\r\nFurther, a unified \"go to\" menu item that allowed me to paste a \"<filename>:<linenumber>\" would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
