    description: "Summary:\r\nIf brightness is set by an app, rather than Settings.app (or the SBSettings brightness control on a jailbroken phone), the device will revert to the brightness previously set in Settings.app when it is locked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the brightness property of UIScreen to alter the screen brightness (as in the article view in Marco Arment's Instapaper app).\r\n2. Lock device.\r\n3. Press home button or unlock device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe brightness should remain at the level set by the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe brightness reverts to the level last set in Settings.app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is true on all iOS devices running iOS 5.0 or later (required to programmatically set brightness)."
