    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhenever iOS wifi sync is turned on, Xcode 3.2 becomes unusable. It repeatedly shows errors about an invalid service or it uses up to 180% CPU constantly. Removing or ignoring the device in Organizer does not help; the device just gets re-added. Restarting Xcode or the computer does not help. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTurn on iOS wifi sync. Start Xcode. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode behaves as usual. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode repeatedly shows errors about an invalid service or it uses up to 180% CPU constantly\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is happening with iOS 5.0.1, and Xcode 3.2.5 on Mac OS X 10.6.8. \r\n\r\nNotes:"
