    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I refactor an instance variable name on the header files, the refactoring process will be successful to search its usage in the properties declaration and in any files that is using it. This doesn't work the same way if I refactor the property of a class extension.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDeclare properties on a class extension and use or reference it in various files, refactor it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should rename everything.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt only renames the variables that are declared in the class extension, not even its usage on the same .m file."
