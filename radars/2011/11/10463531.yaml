    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that any song at < 128kbps bit rate is marked as \"ineligible\" for iTunes match, even for the upload-unmatched-songs phase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun iTunes match on songs with bitrate less than 128kbps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe songs are matched, and uploaded if necessary.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe songs are marked as \"ineligible\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe motivation behind this move is understandable, but illogical for monaural music. A fair amount of my music library was ripped from LPs and/or CDs of old jazz, which is almost always recorded monaurally. (Almost all music recorded in the first half of the century is monaural.) For these songs I most commonly used 192kbps stereo VBR MP3, which for monaural files is only 96kbps. They are higher quality than the minimum bitrate of 128kbps stereo, but I am still prevented from using them in iTunes match.\r\n\r\nThe threshold for iTunes match ought to be set lower for mono tracks: 64kbps seems reasonable for mono music, while retaining the 128kbps threshold for stereo music."
