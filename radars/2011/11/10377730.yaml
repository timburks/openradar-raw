    description: "Summary:\r\nCalCalendar objects retrieved through the CalCalendarStore API should show a distinction between events and reminders calendars.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n[[CalCalendarStore defaultCalendarStore] calendars];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCalCalendar objects where it is distinguishable whether a calendar is an events or a tasks calendar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalCalendar objects which look exactly the same if they are events or tasks calendars.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWith Lion and iCloud calendars are split into two: calendars with events and calendars with tasks. This makes calendars appear to be duplicated in programs which allow calendar selection. The two calendars have the same name and colour, but in one you can create events and in the other you can create tasks. \r\n\r\nIf our program can't tell the two apart, we can't expect our users to be able to. Being able to distinguish between the two is necessary to provide a good user experience."
