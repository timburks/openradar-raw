    description: "22-Nov-2011 09:09 AM William LaFrance:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I go to bed, I like to set an alarm for 8.5 hours in the future so I have time to fall asleep and then be woken up after a consistent amount of sleep. Siri allows this without digging through menus, but it's speech parser has an issue with fractions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGive Siri one of the following commands:\r\n1. \"Wake me up in eight and a half hours\", recognized as \"Wake me up in 8 1/2 hours\"\r\n2. \"Wake me up in eight and one quarter hours\", recognized as \"Wake me up in 8 1/4 hours\"\r\n3. \"Wake me up in eight point five hours\", recognized as \"Wake me up in 8.5 hours\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. If command is given at midnight, alarm set for 8:30AM.\r\n2. If command is given at midnight, alarm set for 8:15AM.\r\n3. If command is given at midnight, alarm set for 8:30AM.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. \"I can't set an alarm for more than one day ahead. How about a reminder instead?\" Presented with reminder for January 2th (1/2).\r\n2. \"I can't set an alarm for more than one day ahead. How about a reminder instead?\" Presented with reminder for January 4th (1/4).\r\n3. Works as expected\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't have an iPhone 4S running 5.0.0 to test this on, but I seem to remember it used to work.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSiri is amazing."
