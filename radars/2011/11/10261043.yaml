    description: "Programs that access user’s home folder via getpwuid() sometimes get back NULL pointer.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens the user has to reboot to fix the issue and all programs on the system seems affected.\r\n\r\nThis happened occasionally prior to 10.6, I have never seen it happen on 10.6 (for me or user reports) but it seems to be back in 10.7.1 and 10.7.2 and the frequency might even be higher than prior to 10.6.\r\n\r\nThis is the code I presently use to obtain user’s home folder:\r\n\r\n    std::string home ()\r\n    {\r\n        passwd* entry = getpwuid(getuid());\r\n        if(!entry || !entry->pw_dir || access(entry->pw_dir, R_OK) != 0)\r\n        {\r\n            fprintf(stderr, \"%s: abort due to missing home folder.\\n\", getprogname());\r\n            abort();\r\n        }\r\n        return entry->pw_dir;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the abort() is triggered for some users (on 10.7+)."
