    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 4, when you double click on a source file in the sidebar it opens in a new window. This is good. However, it treats that new window as a project window, and can end up saving your project's default view settings to be a single source window with no toolbar. This is not good.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project in Xcode 4.2.\r\n2. Ensure that the toolbar is showing, the left sidebar has the files list, and that the size of the window is large.\r\n3. Double click a source file. Observe the separate window that is opened to show the file's contents.\r\n4. Build and run your project. Make sure the project's app is running.\r\n5. Click close on the project window (the one with the toolbar and the sidebar)\r\n6. Click close on the source code window.\r\n7. Once all the windows are closed, re-open the project again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\na) Xcode should ask you whether to stop tasks after step 5, i.e. when closing the only window that has a toolbar.\r\nb) After step 7, the project window should have toolbar and sidebar shown, and be the size you set it to in step 2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\na) Xcode asks you whether to stop tasks after step 6\r\nb) After step 7, the only window that opens is one the size of the small source code editing window.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nConceptually, a source code editing window does not seem to be a project window. I'd be happiest if such a window didn't even have the option to show a toolbar, to avoid confusion."
