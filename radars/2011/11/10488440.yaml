    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I use my 15\" MacBook Pro (running 10.6.8) to run my iMac 27-inch, Late 2009 as an external monitor, sometimes upon coming back to the iMac, the mouse cursor is missing. You can still click on things, but you have no indication of where you'll be clicking, unless there's mouseover animation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Connect external displayport device\r\n2) Unplug USB keyboard (which has the USB mouse connected) from iMac\r\n3) Attach USB keyboard to externa laptop\r\n4) <use laptop>\r\n5) Sleep the laptop & remove USB keyboard/mouse\r\n6) Plug in USB keyboard/mouse back into iMac\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter display comes back, the mouse cursor is visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mouse cursor is often invisible, though it allows mouse clicks and moves.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis did not occur in 10.6.8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRebooting brings it back, but I'm not sure what simpler recovery I can do."
