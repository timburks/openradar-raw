    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen we have to connect to a SSL captive portal to gain network access, and the captive portal grab redirects all the web traffic to itself (DNS blackhole), the OCSP feature will cause problems.   Even if we disable it in keychain, and reboot the mac, we still have issues to connect to the SSL captive portal.  The browser will either timeout or even crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Have a captive portal that blackhole all the web traffic to itself\r\n- Connect to the Captive Portal with SSL\r\n- It will give error on Chrome or Safari because of OCSP, or just timeout/freeze Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGive a warning that the cert hasn't been checked, and let the user decide if he wants to continue the connection (ie. SSL Exception)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe browser cannot connect, or Safari timeout.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been introduced in 10.7.2, it is working fine with 10.7.0."
