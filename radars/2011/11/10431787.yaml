    description: "11-Nov-2011 11:03 AM Antonio Malara:\r\n'prova.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Nov-2011 11:03 AM Antonio Malara:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUsing xcodebuild to run an OCUnit Application Test Suite does not work, but when using Xcode UI, it works seamlessly.\r\n\r\nCurrently we're working in integrating our test suites in our continuous integration tool, and we feel this a real limiting aspect of xcodebuild.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Xcode, create a blank iphone project, or use the one attached.\r\n2. Press Cmd-U\r\n3. The application runs in simulator, and the test suite is executed\r\n4. Close Xcode\r\n5. Open a terminal session in the project directory\r\n6. Build the test target with a command akin to this:\r\n\r\nYuko:prova willy$ xcodebuild -target provaTests -sdk iphonesimulator5.0\r\n\r\n7. Note that, even if the build succeed, the tests do not start, with the error:\r\n\r\n/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Tools/Tools/RunPlatformUnitTests:95: warning: Skipping tests; the iPhoneSimulator platform does not currently support application-hosted tests (TEST_HOST set).\r\n\r\nwhich is simply not true (step 3)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild should run a simulator session running the application tests, OR provide a different action for running them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBuild succeeds without running the test suite."
