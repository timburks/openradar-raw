Currently, this is not working.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a simple app that sets the screen brightness.  Use the brightness property of UIScreen to:\r\na) save the current brightness value when the app starts\r\nb) set the UIScreen brightness to some new value (like 0.0, so it's obvious)\r\n\r\n In applicationWillResignActive, set the screen brightness back to the value you stored in a) above.\r\n\r\nLaunch the app, let it change the brightness of the screen, then press the Home button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the brightness to be restored to the original value stored in a)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBrightness is not restored\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
