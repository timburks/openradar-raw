    description: "Summary:\r\nGit, included in Xcode 4.1+ for OS X 10.7 (currently running 10.7.2, Xcode 4.2, Git 1.7.5.4), shows UTF-8 tracked files as untracked – this is apparently related to a different  UTF-8 normalization implemented in the HFS+ file system (composed, which most systems use, vs. decomposed).\r\n\r\nApparently Git doesn't care about the file system normalization and UTF-8 files are marked as untracked while they are actually correctly indexed: indeed, if you remove the file, it is marked as deleted.  (That's why I classified this bug as \"UI/Usability\".)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn terminal type:\r\n0. git config --global core.quotepath false    # (optional): don't escape UTF-8 file names (problem persists when this option is true)\r\n1. git clone git://git.torproject.org/https-everywhere.git    # or any other repository known to have an UTF-8 file name\r\n2. cd https-everywhere\r\n3. git status\r\n4. rm -f cert-validity/mozilla/builtin-certs/NetLock_Arany_\\=Class_Gold\\=_Főtanúsítvány.crt\r\n5. git status\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStep #3 (git status) should produce the following output:\r\n# On branch master\r\nnothing to commit (working directory clean)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStep #3 (git status) produces the following output:\r\n# On branch master\r\n# Untracked files:\r\n#   (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\r\n#\r\n#\tcert-validity/mozilla/builtin-certs/NetLock_Arany_=Class_Gold=_Főtanúsítvány.crt\r\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs I said, this problem is not directly related to Xcode (i.e., not something you introduced while integrating Git in Xcode), it is included in Git, in any version, as far as I know (a Google search confirms it), but you should at least patch the version included in Xcode.\r\n\r\nI'd be very happy if you could also contribute your patch to the Git open source project (see https://raw.github.com/git/git/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches for informations on how to contribute patches)."
