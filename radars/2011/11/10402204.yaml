    description: 'English Siri uses the wonderful Wolfram Alpha search engine, but German Siri is unable to do so. I understand Alpha is currently only available in english, but this is frustrating. Two solutions come to mind: Wolfram could offer a German Alpha, or Siri could translate searches to english and then query Alpha. Or, maybe, the user could actively request an english lookup or a Wolfram Alpha lookup.'
