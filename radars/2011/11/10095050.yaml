    description: "Currently, Xcode generates a bundle seed ID (the letters and numbers before the wildcard or app ID) when creating a team provisioning profile.  It doesn't allow you to specify one, and it cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nFor application suites that use Keychain or iCloud to share resources among each other, the bundle seed ID must be specified and fixed between all the apps:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1680/_index.html\r\n\r\nFor large development teams like Facebook's that benefit from automatic device provisioning, it would be extremely helpful to specify the bundle seed ID when creating a team provisioning profile, so apps built by the team can share data with production apps built with the real bundle seed ID.\r\n\r\nPlease add to Xcode the ability to specify the bundle seed ID when creating a team provisioning profile."
