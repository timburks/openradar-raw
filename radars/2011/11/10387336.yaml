    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\nI've enabled Network Link Conditioner (with any profile, doesn't matter).\r\nI share my Ethernet connection via WiFi and connect to the WiFi from my iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone should connect to the Internet being throttled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iPhone does not get an Internet connection at all. The WiFi is there and it has a valid IP address but it doesn't get an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on iPhone 4 and 4S running iOS 5.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe scenario would be very useful to test iOS apps from the device under different network conditions."
