    description: "Summary: Currently Xcode 4 displays the same icon for a breakpoint whether it has a condition (eg only break if x==1) or not. All too often I find myself wondering why a breakpoint hasn't been triggered when in fact there is a condition that I've forgotten about attached to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Set a breakpoint on a line. Edit it to add a condition, any condition. Set another breakpoint with no condition. You cannot visually tell which one has a condition without inspecting it again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The breakpoint with a condition should have a separate icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:The breakpoints have the same icon.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
