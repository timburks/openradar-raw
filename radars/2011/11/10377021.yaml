    description: "Call:\r\n\r\n    CTFontGetBoundingRectsForGlyphs(mFont, kCTFontDefaultOrientation, &cgGlyph, &theBounds,  1);\r\n\r\nwhere mFont is Courier New and cgGlyph is 11 (the left parenthesis). This computes theBounds.origin.x as 0, instead of > 0 (it's around 11 for at 24 pt).\r\n\r\nCTFontGetBoundingRectsForGlyphs fails for all glyphs in a font that are greater than the 'hhea' numOfLongHorMetrics entry. For Courier New, this is all glyphs except for the missing glyph at location 0.\r\n\r\nCGFontGetBBoxes on 10.7 fails the same way. Both calls work correctly on 10.6 with identical font data.\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to read the TrueType tables directly, as shown here: \r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/skia/source/diff?spec=svn2593&old=2528&r=2578&format=unidiff&path=%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Fports%2FSkFontHost_mac_coretext.cpp"
