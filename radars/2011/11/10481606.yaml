    description: "22-Nov-2011 02:14 PM Zachary Starkebaum:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iOS 5 when drawing a PDF page into a new PDF context, there is a crash when trying to close the new context. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith a culprit PDF, create a new PDF context and try to draw a page of the PDF into the new context.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNormally this would result in a new PDF with that same page as the original PDF.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExc_bad_access crash and a corrupted PDF output document.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis occurs in iOS 5.0.1 but not in iOS 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe backtrace seems to indicate this issue is related to embedding a font from the original PDF into the new PDF context."
