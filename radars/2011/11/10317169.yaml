    description: "The iPad Camera Connection Kit is incompatible with iPhones. This is both disappointing as well as unexpected (when I told this to an audience of a few hundred at a German Objective-C developers' conference, they were genuinely surprised).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to use it, preferably down to the iPhone 3GS."
