    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSome Mac GPUs are capable of supporting OpenGL 4.0 or 4.1 but the driver support is missing. Please update the OpenGL implementation to a more recent Version on hardware that supports it. 4.0 is the minimum version for example to support standard compliant tessellation shaders which are supported by newer ATI GPUs in iMacs and some MacBook Pros.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduplicate of\t8225498"
