    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UIWebView is offscreen, it's redraw is unpredictable. This makes it difficult to cleanly load content into a hidden web view, and then animate it on screen. The web view either will not have the content drawn, or it will still have the old content on screen momentarily before the new content draws.\r\n\r\nThis occurs if the view is faded in even in response to a content did finish loading delegate call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Hide a web view.\r\n2) Load new content in the view\r\n3) Fade in the view when the view finishes loading\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe web view should fade in with the new content\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe web view can fade in with the old content.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happens reliably with certain pages, unreliably with others\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's understandable that web content doesn't necessarily have a rigid drawn state, given the possibility for animations. But it would be nice to either know when the initial draw happens, or to be able to force a redraw to sync with any animation."
