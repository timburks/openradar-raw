    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen saving a 3.2 format data model in Xcode 4.2, any user info fields you've entered are lost. This can happen if you make any change, even if unrelated to the entity or attributes containing the user info\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project that uses Core Data\r\n2. Set the model's format to 3.2 and save\r\n3. Then add an attribute\r\n4. Add some random user info data to the attribute\r\n5. Save and close the model\r\n6. Re-open the model\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user info data you entered is still there\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll user info data is gone. Xcode user is severely miffed and has to write a radar\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSwitching to an Xcode 4.1+ model format works. Also works fine in Xcode 4.1"
