    description: "Summary: the new moveRowAtIndexPath method in the 5.0 SDK is great, but unlike the insert, delete and update methods doesn't refresh the cell's content.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: display content in a UITableView using NSFetchedResultsController. Order the rows by a \"count\" property, that's also shown inside the cell view. Change that count for one of the managed obejct and save the MOC.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: row gets moved to its new position and the cell displays its new count value.\r\n\r\nActual Results: row gets moved to its new position but cell doesn't get redrawn, therefore the old count value is still showing until the next redraw.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
