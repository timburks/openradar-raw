    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf an iCloud user deletes the contents of a container, subsequent attempts to access the container result in an NSPersistentStoreCoordinator error. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Delete contents of container (on device -- Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage; or on Lion -- System Preferences -> iCloud -> Manage). \r\n2. Try to access container (NSPersistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithType:configuration:URL:options:error:)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUser can access iCloud data. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n-NSPersistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithType:configuration:URL:options:error:: CoreData: Ubiquity: Error attempting to read ubiquity root url: file://localhost/private/var/mobile/Library/Mobile%20Documents/./data/. Error: Error Domain=LibrarianErrorDomain Code=1 \"The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (LibrarianErrorDomain error 1 - Unable to initiate item download.)\" UserInfo=0x176000 {NSURL=file://localhost/private/var/mobile/Library/Mobile%20Documents/./data/, NSDescription=Unable to initiate item download.}\r\n\r\nThe only known workaround is to change the App ID or the name of the iCloud container. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFor more information: \r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8021753/crash-when-adding-persistent-store-icloud-enabled-in-app-delegate\r\n\r\nThis has been reproduced on an app under development. I haven't tried it on a released app (because obviously I don't want to release with this bug). But even if it only affects apps under development, it's a serious problem because sometimes developers need to delete the contents of their iCloud container."
