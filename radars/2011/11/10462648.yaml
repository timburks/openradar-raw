    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Find Navigator in Xcode 4, there is not currently a way to perform a find, restricting the files to be searched to a particular group or groups in the current workspace\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Press command-shift-F to bring up the Find Navigator\r\n2. Click the magnifying glass in the search field and select \"Show Find Options\"\r\n3. Select \"Customâ€¦\" from the \"Find In\" pop-up menu in the find options\r\n4. For the search scope criteria, select \"Location\", then in the second pop-up menu, select \"is within group\"\r\n5. In the third pop-up menu, select the group you would like to search\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should allow me to perform a find just in files within the selected group\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe pop-up menus described in steps 4 and 5 do not exist (yet).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nXcode 3 used to have a \"Find in Selection\" option for its batch find, which would let you select the groups you want to search in the groups and files navigator. This paradigm would be tricky with the new Xcode 4 interface, so I think adding things to the search scope as described would make more sense.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA partial workaround can be to specify a folder instead of a group, but this only works for groups which are organized to reflect folders within your source directory. There is no way to subdivide things further right now."
