    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen I open a note and pull up the keyboard to edit it and then lock my iOS device, the keyboard is dismissed upon unlocking.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Notes.\r\n2. Edit a note (either a preexisting note, or make a new one).\r\n3. Single-tap to make the keyboard come up from the bottom.\r\n4. Lock the device, either by pressing the on/off button or waiting until it goes to sleep.\r\n5. Unlock the device.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* The keyboard is still onscreen.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* The keyboard isn't visible, and must be re-summoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis behavior is new as of iOS 5. 5.0.1 didn't fix it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've been able to reproduce this behavior in both portrait and landscape mode on my iPod touches 4G and 3G."
