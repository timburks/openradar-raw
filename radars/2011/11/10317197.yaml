    description: "The Camera Connection Kit is a great means to get files (for instance, RAW images, Videos, other documents) onto the iPad.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, access is so severely restricted that it is useless for anything going beyond the built-in photo gallery.\r\n\r\nI would really like to be able to access the filesystem on SD cards (or even USB sticks!) mounted via the Camera Connection Kit. This is one of the few areas where Android is genuinely more useful than iOS."
