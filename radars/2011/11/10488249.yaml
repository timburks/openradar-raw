    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I add multiple MacOS X server accounts into my the \"Mail, calendars and contacts\" settingspane it's showing incorrect services under the accounts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to system settings\r\n2. Go to the \"Mail, calendars and contacts\" pane\r\n3. Add an Mac OS X server account\r\n(My account has access to the iCal service and the iChat service)\r\n4. Now add another Mac OS X server account thats on the same server\r\n(My second account has only access to Address book server)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pane should show one account with access to the iCal and iChat service and one account with only Address Book service access.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth accounts in the prefpane show the services of the last account added. Checkboxes are correct.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt gets worse after closing and opening the prefpane again, when you delete one of the two account or try to edit them. Then the accounts will split out into one account per service and you can't configure you Server account correctly anymore!"
