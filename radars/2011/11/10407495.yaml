    description: "Summary:\r\nArchives of Apple's mailing lists are unavailable\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Safari to visit the archive of any Apple mailing list hosted at lists.apple.com, such as http://lists.apple.com/archives/coreaudio-api\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe archive is browsable, organized by year, month, and message or thread\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Archives are currently disabled. If you require urgent access to the Archives, please contact postmaster@lists.apple.com with the subject \"ARCHIVES\".\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor some Apple products and SDKs, the mailing lists offer a crucial collection of information that is not available in any other form.  The loss of the Core Audio list, an API whose quirks and proper usage have never been adequately documented, is particularly devastating."
