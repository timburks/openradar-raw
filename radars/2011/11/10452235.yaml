    description: "Summary:\r\n- iPhone 4S will not connect to cellular network with any SIM after 5.0.1 update. Will always be \"searching\" or \"No Service\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Setup a new iPhone 4S.\r\n- Used it for a few days.\r\n- 5.0.1 iOS update was made available over the air.\r\n- Updated over WiFi.\r\n- After successful update, phone kept working for a few hours.\r\n- After that, any SIM card put on the phone would be left on \"Searching\" or \"No Service\". Phone capabilities will not work. WiFi is working fine.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Be able to call, receive calls, text and receive text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- iPhone doesn't work on cellular network. As if it had no service or no SIM card attached. Won't be able to take or originate calls, text or receive text and use 3G data.\r\n- If the phone is switch off and on again, it will sometimes take calls for a few seconds. After that (or if user tries to originate any call) phone will get back to the broken state again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested two iPhones 4S:\r\n- One was restored from a backup that have been used since the iPhone 2G -- this one is working fine after the 5.0.1 update.\r\n- The other one was a brand new iPhone 4S which had been setup without iTunes and did the 5.0.1 update OTA -- this one does not work on the cellular network.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Tested two SIM cards on the phone with no luck.\r\n- When phone was plugged on iTunes, it was offered *again* the 5.0.1 iOS update. Made it, still didn't work.\r\n- Tried restoring phone with 5.0.1 on iTunes. Didn't solve either.\r\n- Phone was bought in France (Apple Store) unlocked and is being used in Brazil. SIM card tested is from TIM brazilian cellphone carrier.\r\n- Phone has been in this state since 5.0.1 has been made available for update."
