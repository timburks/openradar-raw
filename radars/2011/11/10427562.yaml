    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn the Storyboard Editor of Xcode 4.2, only the primary view of a scene can be visually edited. Other top-level objects could not be edited by any other ways besides the outline editor. Please refer to the attached screenshot\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a storyboard\r\n2. Add a view controller\r\n3. Edit the view controller's scene\r\n4. Add a view as the primary controller's view.\r\n5. Add another top-level view that is not a subview of the primary view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe other top-level view can be edited similar to the primary view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no way to visually modify other top-level UIView objects (refer to attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe regular (non-storyboard) version of the interface editor is able to edit multiple top-level view objects.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: https://skitch.com/adib/g8snh/storyboard-editor-bug"
