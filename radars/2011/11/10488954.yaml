    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen clang fails to find a file during compilation, Xcode reports a generic error even though clang output a specific one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Build a project with clang as the compiler and a missing source file. (Example attached.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe error messages produced by clang:\r\n“clang: error: no such file or directory: '/Users/jayton/Projects/missing_file/missing.c'”\r\n“clang: error: no input files”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n“Command /Developer/usr/bin/clang failed with exit code 1”\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe unhelpful error is produced by gcc too, but there doesn’t seem to be any helpful output to use in that case."
