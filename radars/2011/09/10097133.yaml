    description: "08-Sep-2011 04:40 PM Stuart Carnie:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAs the faux task manager in iOS tracks all launches.  With long-term use without management, the list is potentially the entire contents of springboard (unless there is some arbitrary upper limit set).  I've witnessed most users of iOS periodically clean this up, thinking all these apps are running.  Their perception is these will either slow down their iOS device or consume battery faster.\r\n\r\nIt's also deceiving, as an app like Skype may appear to be running, when in fact it is not and so one will miss potential calls, particularly after a reboot.  \r\n\r\nPlease change this to a real task manager, showing only running / suspended tasks."
