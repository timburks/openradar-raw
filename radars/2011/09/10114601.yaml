    description: "Summary:\r\nApple announced that keychain and preferences syncing, Gallery and iDisk, parts of MobileMe features, will not be a part of iCloud. I and many others have relied on and praised on those features for a long time. It makes it incredibly easy to get back up and running on a new computer, or to make sure you always have your data up-to-date on each of your computers. Specially with Keychain sync, it encourages better security by making it easy to use different, lengthy passwords on different web sites without the concern that we'll forget them and be unable to log in.\r\n\r\nThere is at least one alternative in 1Password for keychain, but it relies on Dropbox for syncing, which has not shown itself to be particularly trustworthy, as well for file sharing, comparing to iDisk (I ALWAYS keep the local / cache of iDisk on my computers with the Sync option)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drop a file on the iDisk\r\n2. Change a preference in an application, for instance, a new Workspace in Adobe InDesign\r\n3. Add a new login/password for a website, choosing for the latest to be random.\r\n4. Send collections of photos to MobileMe from iPhoto/Aperture for sharing with my family and friends. (No, I won't do it from Facebook)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. This file is available for public/private sharing even with people who don't have MobileMe / iCloud\r\n2. This change in the workspace is made available for my other computers where the application is installed\r\n3. This new duo login/password has been synced to my other computers and fills in automatically when I need to.\r\n4. My relatives can access when and from any mean they want those pictures and enjoy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn our current timeline, the actual result is that those features fail because they'll be no longer available. (Perhaps you can prevent this future from happening!).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIndeed, keychain and prefs syncing, iDisk and Gallery have been supported for quite some time now (and at the moment, still are). This is a major step backwards if you keep on this track. I'd very much rather pay for this kind of service than seeing it disappear.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone"
