    description: "Around 9 PM i had done some testing of a bluetooth headset consisting in recording with quicktime and outputing music to it of which i experienced choppy sound/dropped frames so i disconnected the headset.\r\n\r\nAt this point iTunes was outputting significantly degraded sound even to built-in speakers while the same file played fine with quicktime and spotify, a restart of iTunes brought it back to normal, at this pint i stepped away from the machine.\r\n\r\nI returned at 11 PM to find the machine unresponsive with a black screen and cursor, fan spinning around 3-4k RPM , i was able to remotely ssh to it and kill WindowServer at 11:20:54 after which i used the hardware button to restart it.\r\n\r\nInvestigation after restart showed it was caught up in a infinite loop of a kernel hang of which full logs are attached.  \r\n\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: timestamps = 0x0006\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: Semaphore register values:\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: VRSYNC: (0x12044) = 0xdf762\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: BRSYNC: (0x22040) = 0x0\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: RVSYNC: (0x 2040) = 0x0\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: BVSYNC: (0x22044) = 0x0\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: RBSYNC: (0x 2044) = 0x0\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: VBSYNC: (0x12040) = 0x0\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: kIPEHR: 0x1000000\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: kINSTDONE: 0xfffffffe\r\nSep  7 23:21:01 VAir kernel[0]: kINSTDONE_1: 0xffffffff\r\nSep  7 23:21:12 VAir kernel[0]: WaitForStamp: Overflowed waiting for stamp 0x7 on Media ring: called from \r\nSep  7 23:21:12 VAir kernel[0]: timestamp = 0x0006\r\nSep  7 23:21:12 VAir kernel[0]: ****  Debug info for apparent hang in Media graphics engine  ****\r\nSep  7 23:21:12 VAir kernel[0]: ring head    = 0x00000310, wrap count = 0x 0\r\nSep  7 23:21:12 VAir kernel[0]: ring tail    = 0x00000380 ring control = 0x00003001   enabled, auto report disabled, not waiting, semaphore not waiting, length = 0x004 4KB pages"
