    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere is no method for a sandboxed login item to receive access to paths the user has selected through a parent configuration app.\r\n\r\nOne example is an app that uses an embedded network server to support custom sharing protocols such as UPnP/DLNA. This app could be distributed as a parent application that displays a configuration UI and allows the user to select what files are shared and start/stop the sharing service (much like OS X's built-in File Sharing). The actual sharing would be performed by a UI-less login item that is launched through SMLoginItemSetEnabled and runs independently of the config app. Such a login item would need persistent access to the paths the user selected in the parent config app."
