    description: "Please open and run the attached \"AppearancePlayground\" project. Tap the button named \"Button\" with the red title. Notice the rightBarButtonItem of the pushed view controller in the navigation bar (named \"Second\"). At the end of the push animation, it jumps 10 points or so to the right to its final position.\r\n\r\nI assume this is caused by using a custom font (Marker Felt) for the button title."
