Dragging a URL that isn't a hyperlink into the location field.\r\n2. Dragging a word into the search field. If the user isn't familiar with contextual menus, and doesn't have a hand free for copy-and-paste with the keyboard, this is the only convenient way to search for a selected word.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a Safari window.\r\n2. Select any text on the screen.\r\n3. Drag to the Location field or Search field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe text is inserted into the field, as with any other text field on the system.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe drag is rejected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
