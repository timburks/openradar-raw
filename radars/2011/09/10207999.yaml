    description: "29-Sep-2011 12:36 PM Travis Tilley:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPlease read the github issue comments, starting with: https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent/issues/10#issuecomment-2229407\r\n\r\nWhile the bug is occuring, realpath()/readdir() and FSCopyAliasInfo() return paths with different case. The filesystem is always HFS+. It appears that Dropbox exacerbates the problem, but is not in itself responsible. In all scenarios, renaming the folder to a different case and back fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nI guess my second biggest problem here is that people see the bug report, rename a directory, and go on with their lives... leaving me in the dark about the issue's root cause. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. not\r\n2. a\r\n3. clue\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nevents should always fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nif realpath() and FSCopyAliasInfo() return different case for a path, then fsevents are not fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe bug is reliably detected by this code: https://github.com/andreyvit/find-fsevents-bugs/blob/master/find-fsevents-bugs.c\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am unaware of how to reliably _reproduce_ the bug myself, and it's easy to accidentally fix."
