    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the native HTML5 fullscreen video player, the playhead's loading progress bar is repeated in miniature behind the volume slider.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a page which includes a video embedded using the HTML5 <video> element, either natively or due to an extension such as YouTube5. An example would the be second and third videos at http://www.ZevEisenberg.com/portfolio.\r\n2. Start playing one of the videos.\r\n3. Enter full screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe playhead's progress bar will indicate how much of the video has downloaded. The volume slider will have no progress bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe volume slider contains, behind its draggable element, a shrunk version of the playhead's progress indicator. As the video loads, the progress indicator updates in both places. Sometimes it gets stuck at one value in the volume control, but updates when the volume slider is dragged. See screenshot at https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/327b4ce6-5d1d-4504-9d36-bf72a2a0dae8/89467c21fe96fba38d8d472dfb5654c4 , which shows the fullscreen playback controls at three different points in time as the video loads. Notice the white bar in the volume control - it mimics the percentage loaded of the playhead's progress indicator.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem occurs in Safari 5.1 under Lion 10.7.1 and Snow Leopard 10.6.8. It did not occur with the Safari 4.x fullscreen native player. I don't know whether it occurs in the Safari 5.0.x fullscreen player.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
