    description: "Having an App with LSUIElement to YES in the Info.plist and willing to switch it to a foreground app when going full screen, it appears the menu bar only appears when switching back. Also, switching back to LSUIElement seems to crash the app.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/stuffmc/FullScreenUIElement for a Demo App Made especially for this Bug Report."
