    description: "See https://devforums.apple.com/message/536109\r\n\r\nI actually didn't know until today one could pass \"nil\" to this method.\r\n\r\n\"If you specify nil for the nibName parameter, you must either override the loadView method \r\nand create your views there or you must provide a nib file in your bundle whose name \r\n(without the .nib extension) matches the name of your view controller class. (In this \r\nlatter case, the class name becomes the name stored in the nibName property.) If you do \r\nnone of these, the view controller will be unable to load its view.\"\r\n\r\nLong story short, I discovered my XIB wasn't loaded although the doc says it should. I decided to make a small demo project here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stuffmc/NilNib\r\n\r\nwhere I basically load with nil a UIViewController having 2 buttons loading a UITableViewController.\r\n \r\nOne with nil, you can see it doesn't have the TableView in \"Group\" and doesn't have the footer button. One passing @\"T\" (the class name which should derive from the initWithNibName) which works."
