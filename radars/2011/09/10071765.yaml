    description: "03-Sep-2011 10:42 AM Don Drake:\r\nSummary:\r\nHitting 'return' in a new message sends me to the Signature in a new email. It's quite annoying when trying to start a new paragraph to find the cursor in the contents of the Signature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new email with an account that contains a Signature.  Type a sentence, hit enter to start a new paragraph and the cursor is moved to the contents of the Signature.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen hitting enter, the cursor should just move down a line and not get moved into the Signature.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor is moved to the first line of the signature text.\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis did not happen in Mail on Snow Leopard, this started with Lion (10.7) and is even in 10.7.1."
