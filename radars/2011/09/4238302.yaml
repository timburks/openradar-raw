    description: "30-Aug-2005 03:29 PM Ben Poliakoff:\r\nSummary:  \r\nbugreport.apple.com doesn't offer enough feedback to bug reporters.  I'm sure that humans read the bug reports, but this is strictly a faith based assessment.  Over the past few years I've reported several bugs or feature enhancements, two of them have been marked as duplicates and closed, the third is still open.  In no case has there been any useful feedback from the administrators of the bug reporting system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReport a bug via 'bugreport.apple.com'.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReceive an updates (via web page or email) when a bug report status changes.  If the bug report is classified as a duplicate of another pre existing bug (a situation which is *entirely* likely since users can't check for themselves whether or not an issue has already been reported), then the report should be merged with the pre-existing bug and the user should be able to track the status of the pre-existing bug.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA bug is filed.  The person who filed the bug report logs in to 'bugreport.apple.com' a few days/weeks later, finds that the bug has been classified as a duplicate and has been closed, end of story.  The user is left wondering why he/she should ever bother reporting *any* problems to Apple since the reports are swallowed up by the web application without ever offering any feedback or updates.  'bugreport.apple.com' makes the user feel like his/her time has been wasted.  The user gets the feeling that Apple developers are explicitly *hostile* to bug reporters.\r\n\r\nI've filed several bug reports over the last few years.  Each one has either been apparently ignored or summarily closed as a duplicate.  I know that the bug reporting system looks a *lot* different from an Apple developer's point of view, but for the user/bug reporter it appears to be tremendous waste time.\r\n\r\nPlease consider taking a queue from other bug tracking systems (Bugzilla comes to mind).  Any or all of the following features would be *most* welcome:\r\n\r\n- send email updates to the reporter of the bug when the status of the bug changes (i.e. \"problem identified in xxx, will be fixed by update yyy\" etc)\r\n\r\n- if the user's report is determined to be a duplicate of an existing report then the user should be added to the status update list for the existing report (without this sort of functionality the reporter of the duplicate bug feels like the door is being slammed)\r\n\r\nHonestly guys, you could do a lot better.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this bug report will be filed as a duplicate of some other pre-existing user gripe and will be summarily closed without comment."
