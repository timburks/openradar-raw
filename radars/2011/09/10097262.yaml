    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to obtain an IMP from an NSBlock.\r\nIn an analgous manner as \r\n\"IMP method_getImplementation(Method method)\" (http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/method_getImplementation).\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to do something like this:\r\n\"method_setImplementation(myMethod, block_getImplementation(myBlock));\"\r\nOr in english: Replace implementation of method X with implementation of block Y.\r\n\r\nThis would of course require the block and method to have the same return type as well as the same order and types of arguments (plus self & _cmd).\r\n\r\nThe implementation of a method like \"- (BOOL)foo:(Foo *)foo;\" could then be replaced with the implementation of a block like \"BOOL(^)(id self, SEL _cmd, Foo *)\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBeing an Objective-C runtime feature request his also relates to the iOS SDK."
