    description: "Summary:\r\nScreenshots taken with home and sleep buttons do not appear on the camera roll.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a screenshot on iPad running iOS 5.0b7. Open the photos app and look for the camera roll.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe screenshot should be there at the end of the camera roll.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sound effect for the screenshot is played suggesting to the user that the screenshot was taken properly, but the screenshot does never appear on the camera roll. Resulting in a loss of the screenshot.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested with iPad 2 as I do not have an iPad 1 available for testing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
