    description: "Summary:\r\nBanner notifications, while less intrusive, still block critical functions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Mail, iPod, or some other app that has a navigation/title bar at the top\r\n2) Get a banner notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification should trigger the double-height status bar used when in a call, tethering, using a backgrounded VOIP app, or recording in Voice Memos, when showing the notification. That will push the app content down and make sure the \"Back\" button and other functions are not covered by the banner.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEverything just gets covered up.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was introduced in 5.0\r\n\r\n05-Oct-2011 12:51 AM Mike Beasley:\r\nStill in GM"
