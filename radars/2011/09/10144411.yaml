    description: UIWebViews define a number of different navigation types that can be used by webview delegates to determine what navigation action triggered a request. Included amongst these is 'UIWebViewNavigationTypeLinkClicked' which the documentation states indicates that the "User tapped a link." So shouldn't it be called 'UIWebViewNavigationTypeLinkTapped' or a more generic 'UIWebViewNavigationTypeLinkSelected'? As far as I can tell there is no way of 'clicking' on iOS.
