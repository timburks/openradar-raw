    description: "Summary: When you start downloading a podcast directly on device tapping on the downloading podcast item action is not clear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n- Go to iTunes.app\r\n- Download any podcast (only tested on audio podcast)\r\n- Go to Music.app and open the currently-downloading podcast\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Start playing the podcast on the on-disk copy.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The podcast was streaming. If you lose internet connection (or switch to cellular data on a 20 MB+ podcast) the podcast will stop streaming, and the copy that was downloading is apparently lost (not able to start the podcast again).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: During the streaming of the podcast, the iTunes.app, in the Downloads tab, was showing \"playing\". No way to know if the podcast is downloading, finished downloading, stopped downloading or else."
