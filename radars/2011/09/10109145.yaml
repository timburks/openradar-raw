    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I choose a new paper size in Page Setup, or enter a new scale factor, the Core Data model editor does not respect the new size: the page borders drawn onscreen remain as they were in the old size. \r\n\r\nChanging the paper size does make an effect when printing. However, changing the scale factor in Page Setup does not show on screen _or_ take effect when printing!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Core Data model in Xcode\r\n2. Make sure \"Editor -> Canvas -> Show Page Breaks\" has been turned on\r\n3. Choose Page Setup from the File menu\r\n4. Enter a scale factor of 50%\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page breaks are redrawn to show that now you can get twice as much on each page. Hitting \"Print\" will print the diagram with a scale factor of 50%.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no change. The scale factor does not affect the drawing of page breaks or printing the document.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBetter still would be a thing like in Numbers, where you can put it into Page View mode and use a slider to adjust the overall zoom level. However, in the absence of that, it's important that the Scale Factor box does what it claims to do."
