    description: "I witnessed 2 times in only 3 days that the complete UI of my system froze. The mouse cursor was still alive but everything else including the menuBar clock froze. I was able to SSH login into the machine and noticed that WindowServer used 100% CPU (on a 4 core machine). Attached is a sample of WindowServer.\r\n\r\nsudo killall -9 WindowServer\r\n\r\n\"helped\" and I was able to re-login. In cases like this, Lion's resume feature is awesome but I'd prefer if it didn't hang at the first place. ;-)"
