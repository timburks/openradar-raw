    description: "Summary:\r\nIt could be nice for there to be a delete line key binding in Xcode. This key binding would delete the line where the cursor is currently located (much like command-/ comments the entire line), along with the new line that would be left over. Currently, there are bindings for selecting the current line, or deleting to the beginning of a line, but not for the entire line."
