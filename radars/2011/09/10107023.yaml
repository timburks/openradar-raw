    description: "PS for Open Radar: Crap, I forgot to name this one better... I should have called it \"bad error message when exiting with 173\"\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSome \"weird\" messages are outputed in the Console instead of a clear \"exited with code 173\" when exit(173) is called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI'm using a \"development\" receipt. At some time, I moved it on one machine, changed my code, and forgot to move it on the other machine. So the code couldn't find the receipt and thus threw a 173.\r\n\r\nSadly though what I was getting was totally obscure like\r\n\r\n11.09.11 23:40:36,960 com.apple.debugserver-141: 1 +0.000000 sec [9d31/0303]: error: ::mach_vm_read ( task = 0x1b03, addr = 0x00000000, size = 512, data => 0x00000000, dataCnt => 0 ) err = (os/kern) invalid address (0x00000001)\r\n\r\nor the\r\n\r\n21.08.11 13:54:53,484 com.apple.debugserver-141: 1 +0.000000 sec [0bad/1a03]: error: ::read ( 1, 0x10c880a78, 1024 ) => -1 err = Bad file descriptor (0x00000009)\r\n\r\nyou can see at https://devforums.apple.com/message/518398#518398\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA cleared \"exited with code 173\" message\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA totally ununderstandable message.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nCan't see, because I hadn't moved the receipt before.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThere's no real \"optimal\" solution for working with receipt on debug mode -- hope you guys are working on something \"better\" then the current options."
