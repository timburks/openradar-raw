    description: "09-Jul-2009 11:14 AM Joachim Bengtsson:\r\nThe new Exposé always lines up windows in a grid, while the old one tried as far as possible to preserve window position. I *know* where I have my windows because I'm a spatial thinker, and thus when I bring up Exposé I used to be able to know where the window I was looking for was and just click on it. With the new Exposé, you actively move things around and I always have to scan contents and labels to find the window I need, making my workflow stall and breaking my concentration every time I need to find a covered window (which is often).\r\n\r\nAlso, when doing Application windows Exposé, you hide all other windows completely. This takes the remaining windows out of context, which makes it even harder to do the mental context switch required to figure out which window to choose.\r\n\r\nI think the new layout is far superior to the window menu you get from context clicking on a dock icon, and used that way, it probably works. However, replacing the old Exposé layout behavior when invoking Exposé any other way doesn't work at all for me.\r\n\r\n(Also: Minimize windows into app icon is great!)\r\n\r\n\r\n16-Jul-2009 09:28 PM KIT CHEUNG :\r\nEngineering has provided the following feedback regarding this issue:\r\n\r\nYou make a lot of new friends, you lose a few.  Such is the nature of change."
