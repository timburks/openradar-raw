    description: "07-Sep-2011 09:37 PM Amy Worrall:\r\nI would like a command line tool, like xcodebuild, that can install a built product onto a USB-connected iOS device (that is enabled for development and appropriately provisioned). Essentially I want a command line way of doing what we currently do in Xcode for \"Build & Install\".\r\n\r\nUse Case:\r\nOur company is setting up a build server using Hudson. We'd like the server to have a bunch of USB-connected iOS devices (which will sit on docks on a shelf in one of our offices), all running different versions of iOS, and whenever the server does a build it will automatically install the app onto all of these devices. The idea is that we can at any time walk into that room and test the latest version of all of our apps, without having to worry about building or installing it manually.\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\nA command line tool, or an argument to xcodebuild, allows us to install the app onto devices without human interaction. \r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\nWe are reduced to attempting to use AppleScript to control Xcode, to have it select the Build & Run menu item. Choosing which device to run on is difficult, and the broken AppleScript support in Xcode 4 is also getting in the way."
