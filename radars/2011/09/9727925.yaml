    description: "Summary: Once I upgraded to Lion, my external disk (named Annex) randomly unmounts and then within a minute, mounts again through no action of my own. I see a \"The Disk was not ejected property\" dialog (attached) when this happens, iPhoto 9.1.3 says my library is unavailable if it is open when this happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI can't list any because I don't knowingly do anything to cause this situation to happen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExternal disk randomly powers down, unmounts, then seconds later remounts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExternal disk stays mounted until the user unmounts the drive.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNever happened in Snow Leopard from 10.6.0 to 10.6.8"
