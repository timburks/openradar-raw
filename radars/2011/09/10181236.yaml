    description: "Keynote uses \"Cmd Option +\" and \"Cmd Option -\" for Zoom.\r\nThe same key combo is used in Universal Access if Zoom is enabled.\r\n\r\nHowever, the effect of both commands is very different. Since there's no way to change or disable the key combo for Universal Access (only the option to disable Zoom completely, which is not acceptable since the Ctrl-Swipe Gesture is very useful), probably the key combo in Keynote should be changed.\r\n\r\n(This is for the German locale.)"
