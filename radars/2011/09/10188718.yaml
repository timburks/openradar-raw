    description: "26-Sep-2011 11:22 PM Hamish Allan:\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently, it's only possible to redeclare (in a class continuation) readonly properties as readwrite. If it were possible to redeclare readonly properties with no ownership (i.e. no strong, weak, unsafe_unretained), it would be possible synthesise those properties and yet keep those ownership semantics -- which are, for a readonly property, implementation details -- outside of the public interface.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to redeclare a property originally declared readonly as e.g. (readonly, strong).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError: illegal redeclaration of property in continuation class 'OLVIconViewCell' (attribute must be 'readwrite', while its primary must be 'readonly')\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSort of (see rdar://problem/9842232)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks!"
