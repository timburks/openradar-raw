    description: "08-Jun-2011 11:51 AM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is no way to query the system to find out if an AudioSession is set active or not. It would be useful to have an API that let's us ask the current state.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll versions of iOS are affected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI write a lot of middleware libraries and this information is potentially useful to me because I need to know if the user of my library has set or changed the audio session state independently of me. This information would allow me to react accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlso a thought: Maybe for consistency, there should be a constant for AudioSessionGetProperty/SetProperty."
