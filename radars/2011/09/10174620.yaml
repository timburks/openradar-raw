AtomicIntegerArrayTest\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe program ends normally with the following output:\r\n> Running test\r\n> Test done\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe program hangs with the following output:\r\n> Running test\r\n\r\nAt this point, the process freezes and cannot even be killed with Ctrl-C. One has to \"kill -9\" it. It is also impossible to run it in debug mode, e.g. in Eclipse, or to get a thread dump with jstack or attach to the process with JVisualVM.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe program terminates normally when the SIZE constant is set to a smaller number (on my machine, 10000 runs fine but 30000 hangs).\r\nThe program also runs fine with greater numbers if JIT is disabled, running it with the command\r\n> java -cp . -Djava.compiler=NONE AtomicIntegerArrayTest\r\nIt also runs normally with the same JVM version on Windows 7 and with prior JVM versions on OS X Lion (tested with 1.4.2_21-b01-324 and 1.5.0_19-b02-304).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe problem is most likely related to JIT compilation for the following reasons:\r\n- Normal Java diagnostic tools are useless, which indicates the VM itself may be corrupted\r\n- The program runs fine with smaller numbers, probably because JIT has not run yet\r\n- The program runs fine when JIT is disabled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23-Sep-2011 02:50 AM Thierry Monney:\r\n'AtomicIntegerArrayTest.java' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n23-Sep-2011 03:04 PM Thierry Monney:\r\nActually the test case does not use JUnit, but the point remains the same."
