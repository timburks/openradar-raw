    description: iMessage is awesome... The ability to start a conversation on the iPhone and continue on the iPad is cool. But... I also have a Mac... The simplest way would be to have it integrated in iChat. Even better would be to be able to use any other client (like Adium) to reply. I'm hoping iMessage is based on Jabber or AIM, which would allow that.
