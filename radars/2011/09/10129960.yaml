    description: "Currently, it's very hard to deploy an archived app onto a device:\r\n\r\nOption 1:\r\n- Shareâ€¦ and create an IPA on disk\r\n- switch to Finder and navigate to stored IPA\r\n- switch Xcode Organizer Tab to \"Devices\"\r\n- drag IPA on the device of choice\r\n\r\nOption 2:\r\n- Context Menu \"Show in Finder\" of archived app\r\n- In Finder, Context Menu to show package contents\r\n- Navigate to Products/Applications inside the package\r\n- switch Xcode Organizer Tab to \"Devices\"\r\n- drag .app bundle on the device of choice\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish I could deploy it like that:\r\n- Context Menu \"Install on Device\" with a submenu of the available devices (non-green devices greyed out in the submenu)\r\n- That's it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus feature: If there's only one device, the submenu could be omitted and the menu entry named 'Install on \"iPhone xy\"'."
