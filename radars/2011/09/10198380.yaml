    description: "Summary:\r\nHaving Dashboard open while opening a fullscreen app causes the app to become unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open iTunes\r\n\r\n2) Set iTunes to full screen\r\n\r\n3) Quit iTunes\r\n\r\n4) While on your desktop, open Dashboard\r\n\r\n5) With Dashboard open, press the F8 key to launch iTunes. Alternatively, you can click the iTunes icon in the Dock, then open Dashboard immediately after, so that Dashboard opens before iTunes. The point here is getting Dashboard open while a full screen app is launching.\r\n\r\n6) When iTunes launches, it becomes the focused Space. Try to change spaces using swipes, open Mission control using swipes, or anything else involving swipes/scrolling, etc. Also try to click buttons in iTunes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhatever you're trying to do should happen, whether it's opening Mission Control, switching Spaces or clicking buttons.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNone of it happens.\r\n\r\n05-Oct-2011 01:50 AM Mike Beasley:\r\nThis is fixed in the GM build\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
