    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting a breakpoint on a @synthesized property, the developer needs to be able to select which of the two methods that line of source code can represent the breakpoint applies to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a project with a synthesized property in an Objective-C class, myProperty for the sake of this example.\r\nSet a breakpoint on \"@synthesized myProperty\" line in implementation. Note no way to set breakpoint on synthesized setMyProperty method without resorting to adding a symbolic breakpoint and typing the full name of the method.\r\nRun program\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWith a way to select which synthesized method, debugger only halts at selected setter or getter, not both.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProgram halts for both setter and getter."
