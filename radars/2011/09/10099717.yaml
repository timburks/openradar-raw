    description: "Summary:\r\nThe German localization of iPhoto incorrectly uses the translation Bibliothek for Library. The correct translation would be Mediathek.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Language & Text system preference pane\r\n2. Drag Deutsch to the top of the list of preferred languages\r\n3. Open iPhoto while pressing and holding the option key\r\n4. A dialog appears that allows you to choose a library\r\n5. Press the button titled Neue erstellen…\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe proposed name for the new library is iPhoto Mediathek\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe proposed name for the new library is Bibliothek iPhoto\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBibliothek derives from Ancient Greek and literally means collection of books. The word Mediathek which is used in the rest of iPhoto’s interface in the German localization is a far better fit."
