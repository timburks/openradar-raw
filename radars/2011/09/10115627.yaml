    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSince the addition of the \"purchased\" tab in both the iOS and Mac App Stores it is trivial for anyone using your device to view a full history of every app ever purchased on your account. This does not seem in keeping with Apple's otherwise impeccable record with regard to protecting their customer's privacy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open App Store\r\n2. Click Purchased along the top of the window\r\n3. Scroll\r\n4. You will not find a delete feature to remove items from this list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA delete button that will allow for the permanent removal of an application from purchase history. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo way to delete items from the list.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt would be fine if deleting an application produced a warning indicating that if the purchase record is removed the user will have to pay the next time they want to acquire  this application."
