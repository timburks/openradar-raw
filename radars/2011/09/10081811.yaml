    description: "06-Sep-2011 04:15 PM Eric Wing:\r\n'OpenALSuspendResume.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n06-Sep-2011 04:15 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nCalling AudioSessionSetActive with a value that is already set (e.g. setting to true when already active, false when not active), always produces an error condition from the function. Because it is impossible to find out the current state because there is no AudioSessionGetActive (see Bug 9573841), it is impossible to tell dynamically what the current state.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the documentation isn't clear enough when the audio session is set active or inactive for you automatically and when you must set it, so for safety, I must always explicitly set it. However, this seems to guarantee an error condition and I am afraid if this has performance implications or state corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a simple case (used for a different bug 10081775). Basically, I am testing app suspend/resume. If I suspend enough times, I seem to be able to eventually trip up errors on the AudioSessionSetActive. I am unclear why I get it sometimes but not all times.\r\n\r\nJust build/run and keep suspending/resuming.\r\n\r\nThe debug messages when an error are:\r\nError setting audio session active to 1! '!ini'\r\nError setting audio session active to 0! '!ini'\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot sure. Would be more reassured if setting the AudioSessionActive to the same value did not return an error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReturns an error.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
