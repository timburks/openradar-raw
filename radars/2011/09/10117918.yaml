    description: "Summary: when you attach a file to an email in Mail, Mail doesn't close the file after sending the email.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. open Mail.app.\r\n2. Create a new email message with Command-N.\r\n3. Attach a file, either through drag-and-drop or with the toolbar attachment button.\r\n4. Send the email.\r\n5. After the email has sent, put the file that you attached in the Dock's Trash (I did it using Command-delete).\r\n6. Empty the trash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the email has already sent, Mail shouldn't need to keep the file open. The Trash should empty normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmptying the Trash fails with the message \"The operation can't be completed because the item <filename> is in use.\"\r\n\r\nTo make sure it really is Mail using the file, I ran the following command: \r\nlsof | grep .Trash\r\nThis returns the results:\r\nigeek@zevasaurus-rex:: lsof | grep .Trash                                                                                                   [~]\r\nFinder      221 igeek   18r     DIR               14,2       102 20440784 /Users/igeek/.Trash\r\nMail      36486 igeek  txt      REG               14,2    734068 20769178 /Users/igeek/.Trash/Screen Shot 2011-09-13 at 3.51.25 PM.png\r\n\r\nQuitting Mail.app allows the trash to be emptied normally.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nproblem exists in Mac OS X version 10.6.8 as well as 10.7.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
