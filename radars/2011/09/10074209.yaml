    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen purchasing or downloading any app from the iOS AppStore on an iOS Device the AppStore App dumps the user back to the springboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen AppStore.app on any iOS Device. Download any app. Find yourself taken out of the AppStore and back at the springboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to stay IN the AppStore App, like iTunes.app on iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser is taken back to the Springboard, having to scroll back to the home screen where the App Store App was (or use fast App Switching to relaunch it.) wait until AppStore has reloaded it's configuration. Only then are you able to continue with your shopping or selective updates, browsing the AppStore, etc.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAnnoying users since the existence of the AppStore on iOS devices.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is already possible in iTunes.app, why is the AppStore slapping the user in the face every time they download an App? It takes quite some time to get back where you were since AppStore.app doesn't always properly restore state. Especially when you're in the Top ## lists, which always scroll back to the top 25 or so. Even if you were a few pages down the list."
