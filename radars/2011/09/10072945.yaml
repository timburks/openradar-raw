    description: "04-Sep-2011 01:00 PM Wayne Hartman:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen you have a UIView or other element selected in the view hierarchy pane, you used to be able to hit the return key on the item to change its label name.  You can no longer do this in Xcode 4.2 b7\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a XIB in Xcode 4.2 b7\r\n2. Click on a view or other component in the view hierarchy pane\r\n3. Hit the return key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe label for the component becomes editable, assigning a friendly label for the component in IB.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing happens.  Clicking on the attribute inspector for the item allows you to set the value there, but it was much better to be able to hit the return key to quickly edit the label."
