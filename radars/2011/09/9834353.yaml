    description: "Summary:\r\nbackupd keeps waiting for index to be ready with each backup that runs to my Time Capsule.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Back up to my Time Capsule from a SUSnowKings10K540 machine.\r\n2. Install Lion GM (11A511)\r\n3. Let Time Machine run normally.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nExpected: backups run every hour, especially overnight when I’m not changing any files.\r\nActual: backups run every 3-4 hours, with backupd \"waiting for index to be ready\" in the interim.\r\n\r\nRegression: SUSnowKings was much snappier.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is my system profile, tmdiagnose output, and some additional console logs from last night’s Time Machine runs."
