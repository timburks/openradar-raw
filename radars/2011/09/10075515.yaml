    description: "Summary: This is a request to have the behaviour of the 'banner' notification assessed. When a new notification is received at present the banner notification rolls in and covers important functions available on screen such as 'back' buttons. This results in having to wait until the notification disappears to reliably perform that function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Ideally, I believe that when a notification rolls in it should push the screen content down in exactly the way currently employed by the blue tethering status bar. As this system is already in place for the tethering status and the red backgrounding status bars it seems very fitting.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Unfortunately when the banner rolls in it covers important elements on the screen affecting the user experience at that very time.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
