    description: "15-Sep-2011 11:52 AM Joel Bruner:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe fine grain volume keyboard control (Option-Shift-VolumeKey) introduced in 10.5 is no longer responding in 10.7\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a song you want to listen to a little too low in volume\r\n2. Decide you want to turn it up bit but not enough to disturb your office mates.\r\n3. Nudge it up using the keyboard shortcut Option-Shift-Volume Up shortcut enhancement you've been using since you discovered it last year\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe volume increases in small increments, like an audio receiver with a nice big rotary knob that smoothly ramps up the volume.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA course quantized volume increase, like a cheap car stereo\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nShift+Option+Volume worked in 10.5 and 10.6, and has mysteriously gone missing in 10.7.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nResorting to Applescript hacks or using the volume slider are a step backward in ease of use and UX. I'm sure this was an oversight, it makes no sense to do away with this most useful feature.. Please re-enable this feature, purty please! \r\n\r\nA small thread @ Apple discussions of a few bewildered users:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/15732028#15732028\r\n\r\nApplescript hack:\r\nhttp://jurawa.com/notes/item/24-bring-back-fine-grained-volume-control-in-os-x-lion\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJoel"
