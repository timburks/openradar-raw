    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the dock is scaled to its two smallest sizes (when scaling whilst holding the option key) application badges are wholly illegible. Numbers within badges do not take on any meaningful form until the third smallest size or larger.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Scale dock to smallest size.\r\n2. Receive messages via Mail or iChat.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBadges to be legible at any scale.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBadges are meaningless little red shapes at small sizes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBadges had a minimum scale upon previous Mac OS X releases, such as 10.6 and 10.5."
