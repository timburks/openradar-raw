    description: "Summary:\r\nInstruments is not capable to find the dSYM files generated by Xcode build process when profiling an app with the latest Xcode 4.2.\r\n\r\nThe path of the symbols are not saved on subsequent launches of Instruments.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the latest Xcode 4.2 DP.\r\n2. Run Product -> Profile on the device (iOS 5 Beta 7).\r\n3. Select any instrument (Time Profiler would be the easiest to indicate this).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstruments should show the symbols of the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't show any symbols, in cases where the debugging symbols are generated and not stripped.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn a few rare cases, the symbols do show up, after it's re-symbolicated and selecting the right path. But, the searching process and locate function always indicate that the UUID of the dSYM doesn't match with the framework binaries.\r\n\r\nThen, in lots of cases, the app hangs even when the exact path is selected and added."
