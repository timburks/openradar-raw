    description: "Summary:\r\nIt'd be really nice to have TextEdit support fullscreen mode in Lion, to bring a simple, minimal, dedicated, distraction-free writing environment that's built in to the OS. There are several third party apps that already do this (WriteRoom, Byword, and iA Writer, to name a few), but from what I can tell, none of them use Lion's new fullscreen functionality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen up a new TextEdit document.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to see the full screen icon in the top left corner of the window chrome.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's not there. This makes me sad. :(\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone, just never included in Lion as far as I know.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's probably possible to add this to TextEdit through a third party extension, but having an official implementation from you guys would be fantastic. If this is implemented, I'd suggest adding a \"resize width\" function, much like what fullscreen Safari has."
