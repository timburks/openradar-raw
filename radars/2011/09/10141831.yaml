    description: "Currently there appears to be no secure way to check blocks for validity, other than\r\n    [block isKindOfClass:NSClassFromString(@\"NSBlock\")].\r\n\r\nFurther more the lack of a public protocol/class makes it hard (if not impossible) to safely accept a block as a method argument. You have to check at runtime using said (hacky-ish) method call (see above).\r\n\r\nIf exposing NSBlock to the public is a no-go for Apple (for reasony of internal implementation, or whatever), then please at least provide a public tagging protocol for blocks!\r\n\r\nThis way one could exchange\r\n    [block isKindOfClass:NSClassFromString(@\"NSBlock\")].\r\nfor a much safer\r\n    [block conformsToProtocol:@protocol(NSBlock)].\r\n\r\nOne could also have it throw compile time errors when using blocks as arguments.\r\n\r\n    @protocol NSBlock\r\n    //empty method list\r\n    @end\r\n\r\n    @interface NSBlock <NSBlock> {â€¦}\r\n    //existing private interface\r\n    @end"
