    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen loading a video or audio file into a UIWebView, my delegate is being told that the load failed with an error. In reality, the file loads and plays just fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the project included with this bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDelegate method gets called: - (void)webViewDidFinishLoad:(UIWebView *)aWebView\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDelegate method gets called: - (void)webView:(UIWebView *)aWebView didFailLoadWithError:(NSError *)error\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nCan't tell for sure. I believe things were working fine in iOS 4. The googles tell me that this issue has been around for a while.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI imagine this bug report will be dup'd, but I wanted to submit it anyways, since this shouldn't be happening."
