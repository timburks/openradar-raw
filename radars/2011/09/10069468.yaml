    description: "Xcode 4's code completion is generally a great addition (I used Xcode 3 the other day and really missed it.)\r\n\r\nBut, I find that I constantly get \"autorepeat\" as a suggestion when I type \"auto\". In nearly all cases, I want \"autorelease\" instead.\r\n\r\nThe same is true with \"NSStr\": I use NSString A LOT more than an NSStream."
