    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen adding a new Core Data Model Version the focus in the project navigator switches from the old version to the new version. It seems you are editing the new version but the editor hasn't changed to the new version yet.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Steps are for Xcode 4.2 but are similar on every other Xcode 4 version i tried)\r\n\r\nCreate a new Master Detail Application \"test\", activate \"Use Core Data\" and create the project. Select the test.xcdatamodeld in the project navigator. Add a new version (Editor -> Add Model Version...) based on the existing version and click \"finish\". \r\n\r\nWhen clicking finish the project navigator runs a animation which deselects current data model version and selects new data model version. But the editor stays on the old version. You can see this in the jump bar above the editor which still shows that you are on the old version.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEither stay on the old version in the project navigator or switch the editor to the new version.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nProject navigator suggests that editor changes context to new model version but editor is still editing old version.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nCould reproduce since Xcode 4.0 on Snow Leopard and Lion, all following versions had the same issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI constantly change the old data model instead of the new model because of the misleading information in the project navigator and then notice it only because the app crashes / migrations fails."
