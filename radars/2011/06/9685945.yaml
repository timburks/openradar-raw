    description: "27-Jun-2011 05:26 PM Sahil Desai:\r\nSummary: \r\nUIBarButtonItem is ignored by -[UINavigationItem setBackBarButtonItem:] in case it was initialized with custom view. Default value with title of previous UINavigationItem is used instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a viewController.\r\n2. Set self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem = [[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:[UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect]] autorelease];\r\n3. Push a new view controller onto the navigation stack.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter pushing second view controller back bar button item must be rounded UIButton\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter pushing second view controller back bar button item is set to default with title of a previous view controller\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI noticed this for iOS 4.2/4.3 but searching on the Internet shows me that this issues exists since 2.0 SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can workaround it by setting leftBarButtonItem in second view controller (but have to set your own actions and targets, which is extremely cumbersome. You also lose the nice slide animation of the backButton coming from the right)."
