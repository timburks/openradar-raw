    description: "Summary: A CALayerInvalidGeometry exception is thrown when a UITextField with secureTextEntry set to YES is focused.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build & run the supplied example project in the iOS 5 simulator. (I did not try an actual device.)\r\n2. Tap in the first field, whose secureTextEntry is NO, and type something in it. Nothing bad happens.\r\n3. Tap in the second field whose secureTextEntry is set to YES (in IB).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo exception should be thrown, and you should be able to type secure text to your heart's content. This is the case in iOS SDK 4.2 and 4.3.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA CALayerInvalidGeometry exception is thrown when the user taps the second field to give it focus:\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'CALayerInvalidGeometry', reason: 'CALayer position contains NaN: [nan 2.75817e-38]'\r\n\r\nThe stack trace is all internal SDK calls - no calls from the actual project code.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis exception is thrown on the iPad simulator for iOS 5,  but not for iOS 4.2 or 4.3. Have not tried iOS 5 on a real device.   \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn example project is attached. \r\n\r\nWhen I turn off the Secure checkbox in IB for the second field in iOS 5, the field behaves as expected and the exception is not thrown. If I turn the Secure checkbox back on, the problem returns."
