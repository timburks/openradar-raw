    description: "20-Jun-2011 06:46 PM Mark Boszko:\r\nSummary: \r\nThe iBooks page turn animation on iPad feels unnatural, and slightly uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSwipe from right to left to turn the page inside an iBook.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA page animation that feels as natural and true to a real book as the rest of the iBooks reading view chrome.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf you swipe from either the upper or lower right corner, the animation is almost convincing, but if you swipe from the middle of the right edge, the animation creases the page from the touch area to whichever of the two corners is marginally closer. In reality, pulling the page from the center would either result in a marginal curl of the entire right edge, or perhaps even a falling *back* of both corners as the center of the page is lifted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis exists for all versions of iBooks (so far).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would accept a stylized or even completely invented page transition animation, like in the Kindle app, if the iBooks reading view chrome wasn't so intent on making itself an approximation of a real book. As it is, though, the animation feels unnatural in a visual environment that otherwise exudes authenticity.\r\n\r\nFor inspiration: the iPhone app \"Eucalyptus\" has a page animation that fells much more natural in this regard."
