    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I open iTunes, I have noticed that the AppleMobileDeviceService.exe is constantly using 50% cpu in Task Manager on my dual core machine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis happens every time I open iTunes. It does not matter if any iDevices are plugged in or not.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould not peg the cpu core.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAppleMobileDeviceService.exe stays at 50% CPU utilization.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI left iTunes open overnight to make sure this service wasn't doing a legitimate cpu intensive task. When I came back in the morning, it was still using up the CPU."
