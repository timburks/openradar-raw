    description: "Summary:\r\niCloud should provide a way to automatically synchronise Core Data databases, based on some metadata about resolving conflicts. SyncServices provided that on Macs for use with MobileMe, so a similar API on iOS for iCloud would be ideal. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write an app that publishes a document to iCloud\r\n2. Amend the database on two separate iOS devices, while they are both offline\r\n3. Bring the devices online again so they both sync to the cloud\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe databases are merged intelligently, perhaps based on some metadata in the Managed Object Model\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app developer has to do manual conflict resolution\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOn the Mac, this worked via MobileMe, but is not supported on iCloud\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'd be happy enough with record-level last-change-wins, as long as the app got notified about all the records where some information was lost. Doing it per database just puts a lot of work on the developer that could be solved centrally."
