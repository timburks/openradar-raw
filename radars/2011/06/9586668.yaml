    description: "Summary:\r\nIf network requires 802.1X security in order to connect, I need to manually click 'Connect' in Network preferences after every reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get on a network that requires 802.1X authorization, for example Ethernet (but the same also applies to WiFi).\r\n2. Open System Preferences --> Network. Click Advanced\r\n3. Click 802.1X header\r\n4. Create a 'User Profile', for example Yandex\r\n5. Click OK\r\n6. Now 802.1X section should appear in settings (see attached screenshot)\r\n7. Click 'Connect' and after a short while it connects and network starts working\r\n8. Now reboot the computer.\r\n9. After system restarts, in order to use network I must follow these steps:\r\n10. Open System Preferences --> Network\r\n11. Click Connect\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want Mac OS X to remember that I want 802.1X to always be connected and to automatically connect after a reboot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to manually connect 802.1X after a reboot. And as far as I know, there's no way to automate clicking this button. This means that if I want to perform some actions after reboot that require network connection, I can't this to be done automatically.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs far as I know, this happens for all current MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models. And for MacBook Air it's even worse — as if I unplug USB-Ethernet adapter and then plug it back again — I have to click Connect manually even if there was no reboot.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis prevents automatic network actions after system reboot and harms usability as I have not to forget to perform manual steps after reboot. There's no automatic way to script clicking this button (or via command line interface) as far as I know."
