    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOn the Preferences > Privacy tab, cache should not be shown in the same UI as cookies and other website data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Remove All Website Data\r\n2. Visit an ad-laden web site like businessinsider.com.\r\n3. Go to Safari > Preferences > Privacy and see that 20 or more sites are storing data (in the case of businessinsider).\r\n4. Click Details...\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should see a list of sites that have chosen to store data on my computer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI see a mixed list of sites that have chosen to store data on my computer and sites that Safari has merely cached.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nUsers are concerned about two different kinds of privacy, but the Privacy tab UI confuses the two:\r\n\r\n1. Concerns about sites that try to track what I do.\r\n2. Concerns about data which is cached on my computer, which people with physical access to my computer may be able to harvest.\r\n\r\nThe UI is not clear enough about the difference. Without understanding technical terms like “Cache”, novice users may assume that every site that is cached, is actively trying to track them."
