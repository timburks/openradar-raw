    description: "Summary:\r\nFor people outside of the USA it currently is very hard to keep up with the multiple iTunes accounts necessary for historical reasons to be a developer or app reviewer.\r\nI needed a US account to be able to give away promo codes, for example.\r\nI have friends who work a lot in different countries and might have up to four iTunes accounts for purchases in various countries.\r\n\r\nIt would be very nice if Apple could find a way to either\r\na) consolidate all those accounts into one\r\nor, failing that for legal reasons\r\nb) make it easier to switch accounts in iTunes or on an iOS device.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, UPGRADING of all these national apps is a lesson in patience (expedience), as it is unclear from the outside with which account an app was bought. So the steps involved are\r\n\r\n1) upgrade app\r\n2) login using default account\r\n2) exits appstore\r\n3) show message that you need to go to different appstore\r\n4) select upgrades again\r\n5) login using national account\r\n6) repeat for other apps from other appstores\r\n\r\n\r\nNot very 'user friendly'. Even though I'm not your average-Joe audience, there are probably tens of thousands of people around the world who have to put up with this ... fudge.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuy apps using different accounts in different national appstores\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither a way to store multiple accounts in iTunes, or the system being smart enough to upgrade the app from its corresponding appstore without having to log in to that appstore manually.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNuisance, see above.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
