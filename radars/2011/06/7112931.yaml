    description: 'Codesign when being called with -f modifies the file (replacing the old signature with a new one), but it does not update the file last access date. This is a big problem during Xcode builds as a copy phase uses the file last modified date to decide if it must copy the file into an app bundle of if the file in the app bundle is still up-to-date. Result: The file is not copied into the app bundle, even though it has a different signature than the one within the app bundle.'
