    description: "Summary:\r\n----------------\r\nWhen changing an Xcode project while it's open, Xcode breaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n----------------\r\n- Create two slightly modified version of the same Xcode project (e.g. 2 branches in a repository)\r\n- Open one of them\r\n- While open, replace the project with \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n----------------\r\n- Xcode loads the project\r\n- Everything stays the same\r\n- Products can still be built\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n----------------\r\n- Xcode loads the modified version\r\n- But all state in the file browser is lost (all items collapsed *sic*)\r\n- And iOS project lose their target information (show \"My Mac 64 bit)\r\n=> Project is no longer usable, Xcode breaks\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n----------------\r\n- Can be solved by closing and re-opening project, however all items are still collapsed\r\n- Closing the project BEFORE changing it and then reopening preserves all state\r\n\r\nBecause of these two observations / workarounds, we believe this to be only a bug, since the changes are actually supported!\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n----------------\r\nProjects are modified VERY often in my workflow. So this issue is also VERY annoying for us! Here are two situations we encounter multiple times a day:\r\n\r\n- We use GIT and often switch branches. Most of these branches have a different version of the project. Switching branches works with a single double-click. However Xcode breaking takes about a minute to repair.\r\n\r\n- We use the Localization Suite (see http://www.loc-suite.org) which automatically updates Xcode projects with all available localizations. Every such update changes the project and breaks Xcode. SUPER-annoying."
