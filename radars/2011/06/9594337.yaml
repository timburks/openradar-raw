    description: "When an iPhone-only application is run in an iPad and the \"2x\" button is pressed, it should run in a mode similar to the high-resolution display mode found in iPhone 4. That is, not just stretch the button images and native controls to twice the size and the display looks pixelated.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was present in iPad OS 4.2 but missing from 4.3 upwards"
