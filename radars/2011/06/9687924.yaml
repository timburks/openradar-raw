    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen viewing 'All Songs' by a single artist, (which only appears when more than one album exits for that artist), then all the track appear in a list in alphabetical order. This is clearly a mistake. Why on earth would anyone listen to all The Beatles tracks in alphabetical order? That is just retarded. Instead the tracks should appear as they do on the albums (in their intended order), and the albums should then appear in either alphabetical order, or even better in chronological order (given the year in the metadata).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSync more than one album by a single Artist to any iPhone or iPod Touch running any version of the iOS software. Navigate to that Artist in 'iPod', and then tap 'All Songs'. Resign yourself to just listening to one album at once.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs in iTunes on the Mac, or even on an iPod, when I view multiple albums by a single artist, the tracks maintain their order. I would expect the same behaviour on Apple's iOS devices. In other words all the tracks appear but in album order, so the first track of the first album is first, the first track of the second album follows the last track of the first album, and the last track of the second album proceeds the first track of the 3rd album.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll tracks, from all albums are in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHaven't got an iPad to test this on.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease fix this, it doesn't look to be fixed in iOS 5, I can't be the only person pissed off about this since moving from an iPod to iPhone, and I've been waiting patiently since the original iPhone for you to fix this."
