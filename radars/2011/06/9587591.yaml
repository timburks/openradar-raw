    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way to release a 2.0 version of my app that requires Lion, while also providing 1.x maintenance updates to existing customers who stick with Snow Leopard.  This would make it easier to take advantage of new Lion APIs.\r\n\r\nMy app, CloudPull (http://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/), relies heavily on Google's web services.  Therefore, my app is likely to require updates to maintain compatibility with Google's web services.\r\n\r\nMy request is for the Mac App Store to provide one of the following:\r\n\r\n* A way to provide two tracks of updates: one for Snow Leopard customers and one for Lion customers.\r\n\r\n* A way to create a 2.x app as an entirely new app listing, automatically migrating customers to the 2.x app if they have purchased 1.x and are running Lion.  The 2.x app would need to access data left behind by the 1.x app: NSUserDefaults, Application Support directory contents, and keychain entries.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFeel free to email me with any comments, questions, or suggestions."
