    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to check an SSL certificate on Mobile Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect to any SSL enabled website with a valid certificate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping on the padlock in Mobile Safari should show me the full certificate data from the Webserver just like on Desktop Safari or ANY other browser in the world.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. There is no way to actually inspect the SSL certificate presented by the server.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe user does get a warning when a certificate cannot be validated by PKI.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
