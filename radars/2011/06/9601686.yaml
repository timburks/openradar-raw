    description: "Summary: A view controller whose view was loaded from a nib containing a navigation bar containing a left UIBarButtonItem and a right UIBarButtonItem does not show the UIBarButtonItems if the app is compiled with XCode 4.2 & SDK 4.3, but the app does show the buttons when compiled with XCode 4.0.2 and SDK 4.3. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build & Run the attached sample project in XCode 4.0.2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe root view controller's navigation bar should contain a bar button on the left and the right, as shown in the attached \"expected.png\" screenshot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe root view controller's navigation bar is missing its buttons, as shown in the attached \"actual.png\" screenshot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems to have something to do with the tools themselves, not the SDK version. The 4.3 SDK produces expected results under XCode 4.0.2, but not under XCode 4.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHave not tried doing this through code.\r\n\r\nApple has marked this as a duplicate of 9564595."
