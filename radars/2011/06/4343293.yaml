    description: "Broken since Tiger 10.4.0\r\n\r\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-daily.plist\r\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-weekly.plist\r\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-monthly.plist\r\n\r\nThese scripts only run during the night (between 3 am and 6 am), the weekly only on Saturday. Our company is only open from 9 am to 6 pm and only Monday to Friday, any other times the Macs are off. None of these scripts are ever executed and our log files never were rotated as they should have been.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the events in above plists are only executed exactly the time they were defined for and if your Mac is off or sleeping during that time, they won't execute and they also won't execute if you wake them up from sleep or turn them on again.\r\n\r\nChanging these settings to reasonable values should be a very easy thing. Though even better is to make sure that these events run at a specific time, however, if they miss the time, they are executed at the first possible date thereafter.\r\n\r\nA better approach might be to not run them at a specific date/time at all, but have a field that remembers when they ran for the last time and if that was more than a day/week/month ago, it's time for them to run again. So the format should allow something like:\r\n\r\n<RunPeriodicEvery>\r\n<dict>\r\n    <key>Hour</key>\r\n    <integer>24</integer>\r\n    <key>LastExecuteDate</key>\r\n    <integer>123456789</key>\r\n</dict>\r\n\r\nHour can be replaced by Second, Minute, Day or Week (Month makes no sense, not all month are equal in size, let monthly scripts run every 30 days instead or every 4 weeks) and the last exec Date is a Unix timestamp."
