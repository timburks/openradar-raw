    description: "08-Jun-2011 09:25 AM Andy Warwick:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAll the characters on a UK bluetooth keyboard are not correctly recognised in password entry fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to log on to an iTunes account, or type into any other password entry field such as the non-simple Passcode Lock in General settings, on a UK bluetooth keyboard connected to the iPad and try the characters ‘£’ or ‘$’ (shift-3 and shift-4).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTyping ‘£’ or ‘$’ (shift-3 and shift-4) into the field should enter those characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing; the keystrokes are simply not recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWith the iPad set to British English Language and a British keyboard layout the shift-3 and shift-4 keys aren’t creating the ‘£’ and ‘$’ symbols correctly.\r\n\r\nWith the iPad set to English Language and a U.S. keyboard layout the shift-3 works, creating the expected ‘#’, while the shift-4 key still doesn’t create the expected ‘$’ symbol.\r\n\r\nThis is only an issue in password fields; normal text entry works fine.\r\n\r\nSoftware keyboards are fine, and work as expected; it’s only a bluetooth keyboard (specifically model A1314) that exhibits the issue.\r\n\r\nI imagine that changing language/local in the International settings, and therefore causing the letters mapped to the specific keys (that vary across international keyboard layouts) to change, that triggers the issue.\r\n\r\nThis was not an issue on iOS 4.3.3\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
