    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nWhen running iTunes 10.5 in Lion DP4, attempting to retrieve a track's artwork data via applescript or scripting bridge results in an error being thrown. When querying for other attributes, such as the number of artworks associated with the track or the format of the artwork, the data returns as expected. The artwork displays correctly in the \"Now Playing\" area of iTunes as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Extract test track folders and AppleScript from attached archive. A track with manually added artwork should show preview artwork in the Finder, while a track with no artwork should show the default icon.\r\n\r\n2. From iTunes 10.5 beta, select File -> Add to Library\r\n\r\n3. Select the track \"05 Heartbeat.mp3\" from the \"no artwork\" folder and click \"Open.\"\r\n\r\n4. Navigate to the Music section under Library in iTunes.\r\n\r\n5. Right click the added track's name in iTunes and select \"Get Album Artwork.\"\r\n\r\n6. With the track selected, open the attached AppleScript and click Run. Note that the returned result is {\"error\"}.\r\n\r\n7. Return to iTunes, select File -> Add to Library\r\n\r\n8. Select the track \"07 Top Yourself.mp3\" from the \"artwork\" folder and click \"Open.\"\r\n\r\n9. Navigate to the Music section under Library in iTunes.\r\n\r\n10. Select the added track, and run the attached AppleScript again. Note that the returned result here is also {\"error\"}.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n{0, JPEG picture, \"\", false, «data [PICT resource information]»}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n{\"error\"}.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis issue appears to only show up when running iTunes 10.5 in the Lion Developer Preview 4. When running iTunes 10.5 on Snow Leopard or iTunes 10.3.1 in Lion, the artwork query returns the expected result.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe attached zip file contains the AppleScript used to test retrieval of the artwork data, along with test tracks that have both manually added artwork (the \"artwork\" folder) and artwork that needs to be downloaded from the iTunes Store (the \"no artwork\" folder)."
