    description: "(I am reporting an issue in the Czech locazation. The usual description format does not seem appropriate, so I do not follow it.)\r\n\r\nIssue description: The term \"disk image\" is currently translated as \"bitov치 kopie\" or \"bitov치 kopie disku\" in the Czech localization of Mac OS X. (The localization appears in the Disk Utility and elsewhere.) Instead the simple and straightforward translation \"obraz disku\" (\"disk image\") should be used. \"Bitov치 kopie disku\" means \"bit copy of a disk\". Most users, however, do not know what a bit copy is, moreover a \"disk image\" is not a bit copy (it may *contain* a bit copy of a disk).\r\n\r\nPossible problems: In the Disk Utility, \"bitov치 kopie\" is likely to be misunderstood as creation of an exact copy of a disk (on another disk), while in other context many users will not understand it at all (such as in Safari preferences).\r\n\r\nNotes: As far as I know there is no ambiguity in \"obraz disku\" and the term is commonly used in Czech in Mac, Windows and Unix/Linux environment. I also believe that it has been used in earlier Mac OS X localizations."
