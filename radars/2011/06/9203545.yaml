    description: "Summary:\r\nThe constants related to PKCS #1 padding are not documented well enough in Certificate, Key, and Trust Services Reference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead the Certificate, Key, and Trust Services Reference\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Support for Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) via kSecPaddingOAEP is documented in the reference documentation.\r\n- The difference between kSecPaddingPKCS1 and kSecPaddingPKCS1SHA1, kSecPaddingPKCS1MD2, or kSecPaddingPKCS1MD5 is documented.\r\n- The documentation considers that MD2, MD5, and SHA1 are less secure than hash functions of the SHA-2 family (eg. SHA-256 or SHA-512) and provides information about how to use those with PKCS #1 padding appropriately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) via kSecPaddingOAEP is not documented at all although being a public API since iOS 4.1. \r\n- Documentation about the differences between kSecPaddingPKCS1 and kSecPaddingPKCS1SHA1, kSecPaddingPKCS1MD2, or kSecPaddingPKCS1MD5 is not documented but would be very helpful.\r\n-The documentation does not consider that MD2, MD5, and SHA1 are less secure than hash functions of the SHA-2 family (eg. SHA-256 or SHA-512) and does not provide information about how to use those with PKCS #1 padding appropriately.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
