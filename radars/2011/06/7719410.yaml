    description: "05-Mar-2010 01:59 AM Sam Deane:\r\nI have a service which accepts file/url items. It is designed to be integrated into the finder via it's support for adding service items to the contextual menu when the user right-clicks on something.\r\n\r\nWhen I right-click on a file or folder in a 10.6 Finder window, it works as expected - the service's menu items are added to contextual menu that appears.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I right-click in the finder window itself, but not on a file/folder, no service items are added to the window.\r\n\r\nI regard this as unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe Finder window itself represents a folder on the disc - the folder that contains the various items that the window is displaying. \r\n\r\nTherefore what I would expect to happen when I right click on the window is that a contextual menu is shown for the folder that the window represents. This does not seem to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n10-Jun-2011 01:59 AM Sam Deane:\r\nThis behaviour appears to be unchanged in Lion. Is there any chance of fixing it? My product (www.elegantchaos.com/neu) would really benefit from the change. Similarly, being able to right-click on the desktop itself and have the services menu show (with the \"~/Desktop/\" folder being the targeted item) would make a lot more sense."
