    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode 4.2 introduces the 3-finger swipe up gesture to switch between header and implementation files. This is a very useful enhancement, but it doesn't work if the user has the also useful 3-finger drag setting enabled in the trackpad preference pane.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) In the Trackpad preference pane, check the box next to \"Three finger drag\"\r\n2) In Xcode 4.2, open a .m file\r\n3) Perform a 3-finger swipe up gesture\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode switches to the corresponding .h file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode selects the area of code under the swipe, as if the user had clicked, held, and dragged\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPerhaps a solution would be to offer a setting in Xcode that allows the user to choose whether to override the system gesture."
