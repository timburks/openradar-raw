    description: "29-Jun-2011 03:59 PM Keehun Nam:\r\n'MacBook Pro.spx' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Jun-2011 03:59 PM Keehun Nam:\r\nDeveloper Information:\r\n\r\n  Version:\t4.1 (4D58)\r\n  Location:\t/Developer\r\n  Applications:\r\n  Xcode:\t4.2 (819)\r\n  Instruments:\t4.2 (4208)\r\n  Dashcode:\t3.0.2 (334)\r\n  SDKs:\r\n  Mac OS X:\r\n  10.6:\t(10J567)\r\n  10.7:\t(11A497)\r\n  iPhone OS:\r\n  5.0:\t(9A5248d)\r\n  iPhone Simulator:\r\n  4.3:\t(8H7)\r\n  5.0:\t(9A5248d)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen updating an overlay with live GPS coordinates (as to draw the trace path of travel), it works fine until a random point in time (usually attributed to some inter/action with the map) when it crashes. It seems to crash gdb. It does not give out a stack trace message. Xcode changes the editor view to the disassembly and will always point to a line of assembly which is:\r\n\r\ncall *0x24(%ecx)\r\n\r\nWhich can be attributed, apparently, to CGAffineTransform. It is not my code but it seems to be part of Cocoa/UIKit/etc and no matter where I crash within the app it will always track back to that particular line.\r\n\r\nThe Console printout is the following:\r\n\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nGNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1703) (Thu May 26 17:11:52 UTC 2011)\r\nCopyright 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nGDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are\r\nwelcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.\r\nType \"show copying\" to see the conditions.\r\nThere is absolutely no warranty for GDB.

The userlocation on the MKMapView still pings. It doesn't move, but the screen is not dead frozen either. However, touch interactions do not work, without surprise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm not sure. Draw a CGPath on a subclassed MKOverlayPathView and add the overlay. It actually worked perfectly for me until this morning. Simulator was fully cooperating until this morning. I tried \"Reset Content and Settings\" on the simulator to no avail. This app worked perfectly on the device. Again, it was perfect until this morning. Maybe I should restart the computer? Still, a crash/bug nonetheless given that it worked perfectly on the device every time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmoothly panning and seamless overlay af the trail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashed app without a stack trace. Just a gdb error printout.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
