    description: "SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPlease make the network reachability status available via a property on UIApplication.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL DETAIL\r\n\r\nSomewhere in iOS some process is already determining the network Reachability and using that info to update the icons in the global status bar.  It would be great if apps could get access to this reachability status as a simple status code, instead of requiring each app to implement its own multi-threaded code to inquire about network Reachability.\r\n\r\nProviding the network reachability as a simple status code, perhaps available from UIApplication as a property, would (a) simplify the steps to producing a well-behaved application, (b) would eliminate the necessity for tricky error-prone code that causes instability in apps, and (c) would provide a streamlined easy-to-upgrade API that can easily be expanded by Apple in the future, if necessary.\r\n\r\nSome process knows if I am on 3G or wifi - or if I have no network affiliation at all.  That's the information I'm looking for."
