    description: "Summary: If you have turned notifications OFF on iOS 4, then upgraded to iOS 5, no notifications appear from other apps, and there is no way to turn them back on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Turn notifications off on a device running iOS 4. Backup the device. Restore to iOS 5, and then restore from backup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Either notifications are automatically turned back on, or the user is given a choice whether to keep them off or on.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Notifications stay off, and although a dialog appears in certain apps to turn it back on, it simply redirects back to Settings where there is no way to turn them on.\r\n\r\nRegression: Have not tested this on iOS 5 Beta 2.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
