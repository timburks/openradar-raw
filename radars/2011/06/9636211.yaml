    description: "19-Jun-2011 02:03 PM Hoon Hwangbo:\r\nSummary:\r\nMany IDE configurations are depending on project level SDKROOT setting. So cross-platform development (iOS/Mac OS X) is almost impossible or seriously hard. This problem is described in here too:\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/Xcode-users/2005/Jun/msg00275.html\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an empty project.\r\n2. Add iOS target.\r\n3. Add Mac OS X target.\r\n4. Compile both of them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll targets on different platform should be compiled well and displayed as black color under 'Product' folder regardless of project level SDKROOT setting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCheck up the 'Product' folder. One of them will be displayed as red color which means missing. To switch red one, change project level SDKROOT.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDon't know. But it was older version of Xcode3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode4 is intended for cross-platform development, but your testing about cross-platform development is insufficient. I wish you increase test for cross-platform development. And please remember you're making IDE, not an command line tool. Exterior look is all. If something displayed bad, it's working bad."
