    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUINavigationBar loses transparency when another view is presented modally on top of it. This causes data inside the view with the UINavigationBar to shift downwards as the modal view is animating upwards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCurrent view has UINavigationBar with transparency (usually inside UINavigationController). Present another controller modally.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nModal view is presented, UINavigationBar transparency remains intact during animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUINavigationBar loses transparency and views are shifted downwards (as expected if the UINavigationBar was made opaque). Modal view animates.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've included a sample project (iOS 5, sorry. ARC is neat.) and I have a video on youtube illustrating the issue:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSFvzTR5Ejk\r\n\r\nExample source: http://cl.ly/7lu2"
