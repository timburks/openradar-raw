    description: "Summary:\r\nI use Google Talk with iChat. The initial connection to the service works fine. If I start a VPN connection, iChat loses the connection (which is expected), but is then unable to reconnect. Even if I set the online status to available manually, iChat won't reconnect and displays a \"wave\" symbol next to status drop down field, indicating a connection problem. To work around this, I have to disable and enable the account in the iChat preferences. After enabling the account again iChat automatically reconnects without additional user input.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Connect to Google Talk before connection to VPN\r\n- Connect to VPN\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niChat should automatically reconnect to Google Talk without user interaction\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGoogle Talk service stays disconnected. There is no way to connect to Google Talk again without disabling and enabling the account in iChat preferences.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI think this problem sometimes also occurs when switching networks or waking from sleep."
