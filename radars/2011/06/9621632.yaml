    description: "The MKMapView.mapType property currently doesn't allow (at least officially) to use Terrain mode map tiles. However, some apps on the App Store already use the undocumented MKMapType=3 to set terrain mode.\r\n\r\nWe tried that ourselves and it seems to work fine. There's only one problem: on the iPhone 4 Retina display, the highest zoom level doesn't work correctly and displays black tiles (streets are shown, though). This is reproducible both on the device and in the simulator.\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate if terrain mode will be made available officially and the black tile problem fixed."
