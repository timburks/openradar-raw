    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen starting Calculator with German localization (German is the top most language in the System Preferences), it is not possible to update the currency conversion rates. No error is given, hitting the button just does nothing. It does work fine on the same machine, when temporarily changing to English localization (just Calculator, not the whole system).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure German is the top most language in System Prefs\r\n2. Start Calculator\r\n3. Go to \"Umrechnen\" menu and select \"WÃ¤hrung...\"\r\n4. Notice the date of the last update.\r\n5. Click on \"Aktualisieren\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe rates are updated, the date of the last update reflects this update.\r\nSwitch language back to English, restart Calculator, try again and you'll see it works immediately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing happens. The rates are still outdated and the date of the last update has not changed either.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis issue can be observed on all 10.6 releases, not just 10.6.7.\r\nPlease note that according to my network monitor tool, a request is being sent out in either case, even when using German localization; so maybe the issue is not fetching the rates, but parsing the reply data."
