    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsers currently have to click on a support link within a product's iTunes page, which may or may not go anywhere useful. In the best of cases, these support systems require the user to navigate a foreign UI to have their problem resolved.\r\n\r\nMany users skip this option entirely and instead use ratings and reviews to voice their issues, polluting an app's user reviews and possibly unfairly diminishing its rating (especially in the case of enhancement requests). Worst of all, developers have no way to contact these users.\r\n\r\nInstead, I request that bug reporting and feature requesting be made part of the iTunes App Store and Mac App Store experiences, allowing users to communicate directly with developers about their troubles and wish lists without requiring a new set of credentials or learning new UI on third-party sites. All bugs should be sent to individual developers, with the option to have the user's ID be hidden (and emails sent on their behalf by Apple) for the sake of privacy.\r\n\r\nThank you."
