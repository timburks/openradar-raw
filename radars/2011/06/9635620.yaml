    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n* feature request: integrate dev docs into apple forums\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI would like  to suggest a specific set of features with the built in documentation mechanisms in XCode 4.x: integration with the apple dev forums.\r\n\r\n - under specific pages, have a button or webform that allows the user to ask a question - presumably related to the content they are viewing.\r\n ** use search against relevant Apple DevForums to see what other similiar questions may have been asked - show a list of of those.\r\n ** allow the user to post the question to the forums\r\n ** maintain that post to the forums - and if \"answered\", include it in a \"community docs\" link at the bottom of the relevant page in the documentation (or something that can be looked up and inserted) allowing for extended information relevant to the documentation to be immediately available.\r\n ** extend the concept of a post in the forums to allow something to be marked as a specific question (aka Quora or StackOverflow) - with a supposition of the user getting emailed results of any replies to that post.\r\n ** if a question is \"answered\", allow the poster to mark the question as such - which would indicate it's potential for inclusion as a dynamic insertion into the documentation.\r\n\r\nKey Use Cases:\r\n * As a developer, I'd like to ask a question about proper use of a specific API - posting that question to a community forum where I am likely to receive one or more responses with suggestions for answering my question\r\n * As a developer reading the documentation, I would like to see commonly asked questions that have answered, ideally sorted by a popularity ranking of some form (# views? # votes?) that would provide me with more insight into the topic documented, or specific pitfalls to avoid."
