    description: "13-Jun-2011 06:45 PM Fraser Hess:\r\nSummary:\r\nQuartz Composition files are essentially open. There is no distinction between a qtz file intended to only be played versus a qtz file that can be edited or used for learning. A significant business opportunity would exist for content creators if there was a standard created by Apple and supported in the Quartz Composition frameworks that allowed a playback-only qtz format. These playback-only files would be marketed at VJs for example and could not be reverse engineered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake an qtz file and open it with Quartz Composer. The entire composition is open to anyone to use and reproduce.\r\nAlternatively, open a qtz file with a text editor. qtz is stored as a property list which in turn uses XML.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOffer a Save as or Export option in Quartz Composer allowing for the creation of a playback-only qtz file supported by the Quartz Composition frameworks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such feature exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
