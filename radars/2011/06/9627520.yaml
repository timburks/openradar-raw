    description: "Since scheduled clock alarms can currently only be implemented using UILocalNotifications there is no way to let the user select his/her own alarm sounds. The 30 seconds limit is a problem, too.\r\n\r\nAn enhancement of UILocalNotification that allows to set an MPMediaQuery to be played by the iPodMusicPlayer would solve these issues. Additionally an option to pause iPod playback would allow sleep timer functionality.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround many clock apps which support iPod Library alarms let the user set 2 sounds. One from the library to be played when the app is in the foreground and another one to be the notification sound. Since from the user's perspective this is an inconsistent behavior, it is not a good user experience.\r\n\r\nSo please consider enhancing UILocalNotification. Thanks."
