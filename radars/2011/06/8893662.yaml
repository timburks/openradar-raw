    description: "Summary:\r\nI created a slightly modified version of Apple's LayerBackedOpenGLView sample code, found at this address:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/LayerBackedOpenGLView/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10004386-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2\r\n\r\nIt writes to console whenever setNeedsDisplay: is called anywhere in the app and whenever the overwritten drawRect: method is called. You can see that every call to setNeedsDisplay: triggers one call to drawRect: shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nNow enable layer backing by checking the checkbox. See how every setNeedsDisplay: call is now producing two calls to drawRect:? One is from the NSView hierarchy and one from the CALayer hierarchy, you can easily verify that by setting a break point at drawRect and have a look at the backtrace.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile the attached sample code.\r\n2. Watch the console/runlog output.\r\n3. Toggle the layer backing flag.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo matter if layer-backed or not, each call to setNeedsDisplay: triggers a call to drawRect:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf not layer-backed, a call to setNeedsDisplay: triggers a call to drawRect:. If layer-backed, a call to setNeedsDisplay: triggers two calls to drawRect:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis causes performance issues and also causes our application to produce corrupted UI output. So we either have to use the NSOpenGLView without layer backing or a CAOpenGLLayer instead, using a layer-backed NSOpenGLView is not possible, at least not under 10.6."
