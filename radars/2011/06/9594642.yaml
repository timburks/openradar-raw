    description: "Summary:\r\nLocation Services options appear under Settings - General - Restrictions - Allow Changes.\r\nMail, Contacts, Calendar options does not appear under Settings - General - Restrictions - Allow Changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Settings - General - Restrictions \r\n2. Enter your passcode and scroll down to Allow Changes.\r\n3a. Tap on Locations.\r\n3b. Go back and tap on Accounts. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3a. Allow Changes/Don't Allow Changes options appear together with Location Services options.\r\n3b. Allow Changes/Don't Allow Changes options appear together with Mail, Contacts, Calendar options. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail, Contacts, Calendar Options does not appear under 3b above. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWith Restrictions enabled, users who need to make changes to their Mail, Contacts, Calendar options will need to perform the following:\r\n1. Go to Settings - General - Restrictions\r\n2. Enter passcode to proceed.\r\n3. Scroll down to Allow Changes.\r\n4. Tap on Accounts, followed by Allow Changes.\r\n5. Go back up three levels. \r\n6. Tap on Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\r\n7. Tap on an account and make relevant changes.\r\n8. Go back one level.\r\n9. Tap on General - Restrictions.\r\n10. Enter passcode to proceed. \r\n11. Scroll down to Allow changes.\r\n12. Tap on Accounts, followed by Don't Allow Changes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs you can see, there are too many steps involved just to make changes to any Mail, Contacts, Calendar settings when Restrictions are enabled. A user may forget to switch back to Don't Allow Changes once they have made changes to their Mail, Contacts, Calendar settings. It would be a convenience if the relevant sections appear under Settings - General - Restrictions - Accounts - Allow Changes."
