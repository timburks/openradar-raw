    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you have no tabs open and re-start Safari, it re-opens tabs that you had explicitly closed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In Safari > Preferences > General, choose the following settings:\r\n    * Safari opens with: All windows from last session\r\n    * New windows open with: Empty Page\r\n2. Open a few tabs in Safari.\r\n3. Open a new blank window in Safari (Cmd-N).\r\n4. CLOSE any other Safari window that was open. At this point only the one blank window should be open.\r\n5. Quit Safari.\r\n6. Restart Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSafari should open with a single blank window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSafari re-opens the window that had all the tabs open, as well as the blank window.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhen re-opening Safari, a user could inadvertently reveal sensitive or private information that they had closed."
