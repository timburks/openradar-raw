We have background syncing set to skip certain folders including \"~/Music/iTunes/\".  While it appears to be respecting most of the other folder rules, our end users are receiving sync errors on their iTunes Library any time they run iTunes.  Most of our client machines are on 10.6.7, with one user who's on 10.5.8.  Most of our end users are experiencing this issue with the exception of one who deleted his iTunes Library xml and once it was recreated the error disappeared.  I've checked permissions and verified our setup is correct and verified the users are not a member of any other group with mobile home settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-Create managed preference group with \"Home Sync\" set to skip \"~/Music/iTunes/\" on background sync\r\n-Added user to the group\r\n-Log into the client machine and run iTunes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-No sync errors.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-Sync errors on \"~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library\" every hour when background syncing is performed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
