    description: "06-Oct-2010 11:40 PM Steve Nicholson:\r\nSummary:\r\nVoice Control can't be used to initiate a phone call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Press and hold iPhone 3GS home button \r\n2) Say \"call <contact name>. Home.\r\n3) Voice Control says \"calling <contact name>. Home.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCall is made\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo call is made.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorked in iPhone OS 3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBefore I updated my iPhone 3GS to iOS 4.1, I could use Voice Control when the iPhone was connected to my 2010 Prius via Bluetooth. I'd hold the home button, Voice Control would come on, the double-beep would play through the iPhone speaker, I'd say \"Call Johnny Appleseed. Home.\", Voice Control would say \"Calling Johnny Appleseed. Home.\" through the iPhone speaker, and the call would happen through the car audio system.\r\n\r\nNow when I press and hold the home button, Voice Control comes on but the double-beep plays through the car audio system. I say \"Call Johnny Appleseed. Home.\", Voice Control says \"Calling Johnny Appleseed. Home.\" through the car audio system, then the Prius display shows \"Call Disconnected\" and no call is made.\r\n\r\n11-Oct-2010 06:12 PM Steve Nicholson:\r\nCar is with Navigation\r\n\r\nI've attached the contents of the Console tab from Xcode's Organizer window. I hope this is what you meant by \"syslog\". If not, please tell me how to get you the information you want. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n13-Oct-2010 05:27 PM Steve Nicholson:\r\nInstalled iOS 4.2 beta 3. Behavior is the same.\r\n\r\nApple Developer Notes:\r\n11-Oct-2010 01:58 PM Patrick Collins :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\n - Is the car with or without Navigation?\r\n - Can you please attach a syslog to the bug report.\r\n\r\n09-Jun-2011 09:40 AM Patrick Collins :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
