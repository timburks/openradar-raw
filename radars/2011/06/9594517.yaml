    description: "Summary:\r\nMy app applies CATransform3D rotations to UIButtons to form pseudo cubes.\r\nWhen the app is backgrounded (home button), the automatic snapshot is taken after the CALayer data is flushed (is my best guess), thus, the snapshot doesn't look like the UI and it's jarring when the app is returned to the foreground.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached example app buttonLayerSnapshot.\r\n1) use UIButton with .layer.transform = (CATransform3D rotations).  (sample image in project folder: \"Screenshot.png\")\r\n2) background app.\r\n3a) foreground app and watch closely.\r\n3b) look at the <HEX>/Library/Caches/Snapshots/<appID>/UIApplicationAutomaticSnapshotDefault-Portrait.jpg  (sample image in project folder)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAutomatic snapshot image expected to look like app UI when transition to background is initiated, resulting in seamless visual transition from automatic snapshot to live UI when returning to foreground.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAutomatic snapshot doesn't look like app UI when transition to background is initiated.\r\nTesters report eyeballs actually bleeding due to jarring experience of looking at horrible snapshot image for .4 seconds before soothing, live UI is restored.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas happened since multitasking was added to iOS (I believe).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only workaround I'm aware of is to take my own screen snapshot and present it on top of my UI for the system to take its automatic snapshot."
