    description: In iOS there is no keyboard for Belarusian language (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_language). It can be easily created from Russian by replacing "и" with "і", "щ" with "ў" and "ъ" with "'" (apostrophe). Also it would be comfortable to have the replaced symbols after a long-touch of these buttons, to be able to use Belarusian layout for both Belarusian and Russian texting.
