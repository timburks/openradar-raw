    description: "Summary:\r\nOnly the user installing software via drag'n drop to /Applications is able to remove the quarantine extended attribute (com.apple.quarantine). Not even an admin can remove it, unless he goes to command line and uses sudo. In a multi-user environment, one where all users are \"normal\" users and there is one (or multiple) dedicated admin account(s), with password known to some users, this is really a problem, since users cannot simply de-quarantine applications installed to /Application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in as a non-admin user.\r\n2. Download an application that ships inside a DMG via Safari.\r\n3. Mount the DMG.\r\n4. Install the software by dragging it to /Applications.\r\n5. You get prompted for an admin account login, so type in the name of an administrator user and the appropriate password.\r\n6. Log out.\r\n7. Log in as another user, admin or non admin user doesn't matter.\r\n8. Start the application.\r\n9. You get prompted if you want to really start the application download from the Interent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou select to really start it and the quarantine attribute is removed. Since you don't have permissions to remove the extended attribute, you are prompted for an admin login, to make a helper process become root and remove the attribute. After quitting and restarting the application, you shouldn't be prompted again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application starts, but the attribute is not removed. Quit it, start it again, you are prompted again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:"
