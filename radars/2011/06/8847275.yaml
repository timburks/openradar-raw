    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen installing applications via an installer or via the Mac App Store, they are usually copied to /Applications and their ownerships are either set as root:admin (most installers) or root:wheel (Mac App Store). This is a very good practice, as it prevents an malicious tool (e.g. a Trojan) to later on modify an installed application, since neither normal users, nor admin users have write access to the application bundle by default and such an access is also not necessary in almost any case.\r\n\r\nHowever, when installing an application to /Applications via drag'n drop as a normal user, you are prompted for an admin login to gain the necessary privileges to write to /Applications, but the app bundle is still owned by your user and your user still has write access to *ALL* files in the bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download an application as a normal user.\r\n2. Install it to /Applications via drag'n drop.\r\n3. You receive an authorization prompt; authorize as admin user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe just copied app bundle is now either owned by the admin (and his default group), it is owned by root:admin or by root:wheel. The user that just installed it there has no write access to it any longer, when deleting it (dragging it to trash), he has to authenticate as admin again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user has still write access, thus any malicious software ran by this user with NORMAL user privileges can modify the application bundle, e.g. exchanging the main binary by an *EVIL* binary, that can harm your system (e.g. delete all files in the user home or prompt for admin login to gain root privileges, most users knowing the admin account will provide those, and then everything is possible).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the software has an embedded, privileged helper tool, the malicious tool might modify it, since many applications still don't install privileged helpers to /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools and even if it does, when the file is changed in the app bundle, many tools will re-install it, thus installing malicious code and gaining root privileges."
