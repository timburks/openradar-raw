    description: "The current iOS multi tasking suffers from the same fate as Android multi tasking and needs a Task Manager or an easy way to QUIT apps.\r\n\r\nI notice lags after using several apps after each other. The system was snappy again after I quit some programs. Quitting now takes some hoops to jump through:\r\n\r\na) slide screen upwards (easy and great UI)\r\nb) select icon to start the wiggle\r\nc) quit apps you want to quit\r\nd) scroll icon bar\r\ne) repeat until finished\r\n\r\nWhat would be really helpful is a 'Really Quit' method when you quit an app. Kinda like Backgrounder in the jailbreak community (of which I have only hearsay knowledge of course):\r\na) When you click the home button, the app quits\r\nb) When you click and hold the home button, the app closes but keeps running in the background.\r\n\r\nApple could reverse this behaviour of course: When you click and hold the home button, the app really quits.\r\n\r\nThis would make it easier to quit 'once-a-week apps', without having the garbage collecting effect of slowness, like some other OSes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen up several apps on iPhone, among which background-enabled apps. More noticable on older models with less memory, e.g. 3GS.\r\n\"Quit\" apps using quit button.\r\nOpen up some new apps: they take longer to load, hence the system feels slower\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app quits, as in iOS before 4.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp keeps staying open."
