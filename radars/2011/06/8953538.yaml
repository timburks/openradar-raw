    description: "When taking a screenshot of an application on iOS, the file is simply named IMG_(Number).PNG. It would be far more useful to users who take a large number of screenshots to include the Application name in the filename\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nLaunch Mail on your iOS device.\r\nPress the Home and Power button on your favourite iOS device\r\nConnect to your Mac and fire up Image Capture\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe Screenshot should be named after the application, ideally with a timestamp. Mail 3-2-2011.PNG or some other user-friendly format.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe screenshot of Mail is simply named IMG_XXX.PNG\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've got roughly 5,000 screenshots in my LittleSnapper[1] library and would love to have to not try and remember the app names when organising screenshots!\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper"
