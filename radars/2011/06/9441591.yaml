    description: "15-May-2011 02:58 AM Adam Nohejl:\r\nWhen no mailbox is selected in the Mail application the Czech localized title of the viewer window is \"Žádná schránka nevybrána\", which is correct but awkward. A better translation would be \"Není označená (vybraná) žádná schránka\".\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nJune 11:\r\n\r\nI've checked the latest preview update (Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview 4 Build 11A480b), and the window title has indeed changed. Now it reads \"Schránka nevybrána\". There are two reasons why I think that this is not appropriate:\r\n\r\n1. It's an awkward constructions. As I have said a natural way to say this is \"Není označená (vybraná) žádná schránka\".\r\n\r\n2. The verb \"vybrat\" in conjunction with the terse formulation suggests this meaning \"(the contents of) the mailbox have not been taken out\", which would likely mean that no messages were downloaded. In normal speech \"vybrat schránku\" means to get mail out of a mailbox.\r\n\r\nThis is connected with radar #9441516, in which I explain why \"select\" should be translated as \"označit\", not as \"vybrat\". If you use \"označit\" in this case, the terse formulation (schránka neoznačena) at least won't be ambiguous (but it will still be very awkward).\r\n\r\nI'd suggest (1) using a longer formulation for the window title and (2) reevaluating the translation of \"select\" in Mac OS X. The usage of \"Vybrat\" will inevitably lead to similar confusion elsewhere."
