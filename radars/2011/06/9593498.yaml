    description: "Summary: The option 'Open \"safe\" files after downloading' (which is on by default) has no effect. Safari does not open pictures or disk images.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Check that the 'Open \"safe\" files after downloading' option is on in Safari's preferences. Download a disk image (.dmg) or a PNG picture.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The file should open.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The file does not open. (The Downloads icon in the Dock just bounces.)\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: Curiously, an installation dialog opens after downloading a dashboard widget from apple.com."
