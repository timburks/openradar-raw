    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n  When adding new devices to the provisioning portal via file upload, any currently existing device ids cause an error to occur. This error does not specify which devices are redundant, forcing a manual match between currently registered devices and the list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1) Register some devices, manually or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  2) Create a devices file with new device ids, and include one device already registered.\r\n\r\n  3) Select the devices file via the web upload form\r\n\r\n  4) Submit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n  All devices not previously registered are registered. Any pre-existing devices are ignored.\r\n\r\n  Possibly alert the user that there were M devices added and N devices were duplicates.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n  Error, with no information about which devices were redundant.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n  No\r\n\r\nNotes:"
