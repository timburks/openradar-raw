    description: I discovered recently that typing with one finger while dragging the loupe to place the cursor adds characters wherever the insertion point happens to be at the moment. This is extremely convenient, since it can be difficult to release one's finger just right so the insertion point stays where intended. However, although the text view reflects the addition of characters, the magnified view in the loupe does not, UNTIL the user moves the loupe, even by a pixel. Since the user's visual focus is very likely on the loupe, this means it is easy to mistakenly insert a character without realizing it, until the loupe is dismissed by lifting that finger. Although I'm guessing typing while editing isn't a popular use case (and perhaps it wasn't specifically planned for) it is extremely useful to me, and this bug is a real annoyance.
