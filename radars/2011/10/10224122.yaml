    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAdd domain filter for Network Link Conditioner preference pane. I love the new Network Link Conditioner preference pane added as a part of Xcode 4.1, but I'd love it even more if I could limit its effect to a specific domain or IP address. Much like Speed Limit (http://mschrag.github.com/) does. This could be added as a list of domains in general to use per configuration profile, or as a part of the configuration profiles themselves.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Network Link Conditioner Preference pane\r\n2. Look for domain limiting as well as network profile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Find a place to enter which domains are affected by the profile.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Nowhere to specify specific domains to apply the profile to.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe reason I'd really like this is that I'd like my other network activities (streaming music, downloads, skype, etc) to remain viable while testing networking against a specific host's api in my apps."
