    description: "Summary:\r\nThe default config of Roundcube, the Lion Server's webmail, has a problem. When a new user is authenticated, the wemail add the server FQDN as domain name and not the domain configured in Server.app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Setup a Lion Server with directory services and mail server. Name your server mainserver.pretendco.com and choose pretendco.com as domain name for internet address.\r\n- Create somes users, Server.app automatically filled-up the email address like shortname@pretendco.com\r\n- Open your webmail https://mainserver.pretendco.com/webmail and login\r\n- Now go into Preferences > Identities and select your ID on the left. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou e-mail address should be shortname@pretendco.com\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou e-mail address is shortname@mainserver.pretendco.com\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bug wasn't here in SquirrelMail, and it's not really a bug, it's the default behavior for Roundcube, so it's look like a untested integrationâ€¦\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe good solution for this problem is to add the capabilities to servermgrd to edit the good config file. But if you can patch it quickly for 10.7.2 you have just to edit this file : /usr/share/webmail/config/main.inc.php and set a %d inside the quote of this line :\r\n\r\n$rcmail_config['mail_domain'] = '';\r\n\r\nWith a %d Roudcube take the domain name of the http address used to access to the webmail. It's not a perfect solution but it can be a good patch until you update serverngrd."
