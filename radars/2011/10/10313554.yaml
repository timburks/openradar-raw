    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the AppStore doesn't not support the use of promo codes for in-app purchases SKUs.  This is a serious problem for both enterprise and educational users who buy in bulk, and also ned the ability to bulk-purchase whatever IAP-based features may exist in an app."
