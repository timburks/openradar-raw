I asked Siri, \"How do I get to the Enclave?\" (a local business). Siri responded with directions shown in figure 1. The destination on the map is incorrect.\r\n\r\n2. I tapped on the destination pin in the directions, and the address was as shown in figure 2-- 5376 Tomah Dr. This is the old business address, but I don't think it was in my contacts list.\r\n\r\n3. I opened Contacts and looked up the Enclave's address. It's shown in figure 3, 2121 Academy Circle (mistyped in the figure, but fixing the spelling had no effect). There is only one entry for the Enclave in Contacts on this phone.\r\n\r\n4. I asked Siri, \"What is the address of the Enclave?\". Siri responded with the correct address (fig. 4). However if I repeat step 1 I get the same result.\r\n\r\n5. Combining the two approaches, I asked \"What is the address of the Enclave?\". Siri gave me the correct address. I then asked \"How do I get there?\". Siri gave me a map to the incorrect address.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSiri would use addresses found in Contacts for people and businesses found in Contacts. Siri would use the same address regardless of query.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSiri's using an old address, which may have previously been in Contacts but is not now. Siri's using different addresses for the same business depending on what question is asked.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone, new feature.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
