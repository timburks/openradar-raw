    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Xcode 4.2 Storyboard you cannot simulate the UI for prototyping and testing anymore. The menu entry Editor > Simulate Document always stays greyed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new iOS project in Xcode 4.2. Create or edit and ViewController's GUI in a XIB and put any UI elements. Try to simulate the UI with the Simulator by choosing Editor > Simulate document from the menubar. The entry is deactivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect this entry to be active when a window is selected in the storyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEditor > Simulate Document is ALWAYS inactive, no matter what is selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly when using Storyboard in Xcode 4.2. Any normal XIB UI window for iOS can be simulated perfectly. Copying the window from the storyboard view to an empty or existing xib will allow you to use the simulation just fine. So this seems to be an oversight in the storyboard editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug makes it a lot harder to work with UI/UX design and have a rapid turnaround cycle when testing UI. It makes it terribly annoying to use the otherwise very nice storyboard. So annoying that I'm willing to skip the new storyboard completely as it's too cumbersome to use for UI development."
