    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSiri: Location services icon for Siri appears everywhere. Even in applications that do not use location services. This is confusing to the user, I know it confused the heck out of me as it appears the application has accessed the user's location when in fact is was a background system service, Siri.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTurn on Siri location services in the Location Services settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect that the location services icon in the status bar reflect what the application has done.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe location services icon in the status bar is reflecting Siriâ€”which is all the time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you should go about fixing this. One way might be to use a different location services icon for Siri. Another way might be to have some type of color background that the location services icon is super imposed onto. So Siri would be say a green circle and the location icon, if used by the application, is then drawn on top."
