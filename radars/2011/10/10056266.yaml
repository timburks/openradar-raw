    description: "I know you're touting Newsstand as a big feature in 5.0.  I have no interest in ever seeing it.  I generally shove all of the apple provided apps that i never use (compass, photo booth, youtube, notes, weather, stocks, clock, voice memos) into a \"Useless Shit\" folder since its not possible to go into the settings app and disable their display.  I can't do this with newsstand because it is a special anointed folder of its own and you don't allow for a folder hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInstall iOS 5\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTo be able to dispense with it, I'm never going to use it. I don't want to see it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt sits there, ugly and in the way.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIdeal solution would be to allow us to enable/disable the display of all the apple provided apps via the settings app so that we can \"get rid of\" the apps we never use, but can't delete because they're apple provided."
