Log out of iCloud\r\n2. Start Recipes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApp starts normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApp immediately crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAll versions of iPhoneCoreDataRecipes Sample Code for iCloud, all iOS5 seeds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt is critical that developers know the best practices for failing gracefully when a user does not have an iCloud account, and also making sure that users are able to login to iCloud while the app is running, and have it sync their changes.\r\n\r\nURLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier returning nil is a common and supported behavior according to the docs, and the sample code should handle this situation and display the best practices for doing so.\r\n\r\nForum posts:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/518031#518031\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/518045#518045\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/530199#530199 \r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/551823#551823\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/552256#552256\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/535118#535118\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/554095#554095"
