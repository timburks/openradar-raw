    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen using the list or album list view in iTunes to browse the library, if you have the artists column focused and then type to select an artist the artist list will scroll to show the selected artist but if you then use the mouse scroll wheel the artist list will start scrolling from the very top (the \"All\" artist).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Click \"Music\" in source list of iTunes window.\r\n2. Choose \"List\" or \"Album List\" from View menu.\r\n3. Click in \"Artists\" column to focus that column.\r\n4. Type first letter(s) of artist that is not currently visible to select, causing the \"Artists\" list to scroll to show the selected artist.\r\n5. Use mouse scroll wheel to scroll the \"Artists\" column.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nScrolling in \"Artists\" column should scroll the list from the currently selected artist name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nScrolling jumps to the top of the list and continues from there.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNot observed in previous versions of iTunes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis only happens when the artist list is long enough to require scrolling in the window. iTunes 10.5 (141) 64-bit running on iMac 27\" late 2009 on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 with 12 gigabytes RAM. iTunes media folder is an external FireWire disk."
