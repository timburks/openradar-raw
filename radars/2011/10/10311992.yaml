    description: "Request that iOS support Latin American Spanish (es-419) in addition to Generic/Spanish Spanish (es-es).\r\n\r\nCurrently iOS supports only one variety of Spanish, requiring apps to be localized in an awkward generic version of Spanish that is not appropriate for Continental or Latin American users.  Thus, we request that iOS support both the Spanish variant (es-es) and Latin American variant (es-419) of Spanish, to allow better app localization."
