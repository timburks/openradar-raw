Start up Recipes\r\n2. Tap the '+' button and then hit either Cancel or Save.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUI functioning normally at all times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe UI will freeze until/unless the persistent store has been asynchronously added. It will appear to freeze/crash, but work normally after the persistent store is added.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nOccurred in all versions of iPhoneCoreDataRecipes and all iOS seeds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nForum post with greater detail: https://devforums.apple.com/message/553148#553148"
