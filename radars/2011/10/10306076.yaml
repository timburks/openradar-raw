    description: "Summary:\r\nThe SoH (or Statement of health) is a technology developed by Microsoft to enable network access protection.  It sends information about the state of the machine when you are connecting to a EAP-PEAP network.  While this is fully supported in Windows, there is a growing demand to support this standard on other platforms in the enterprise world.\r\n\r\nI know that WPA-Supplicant is having this feature in their linux software.  I think it would be nice that Apple implement that as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMore information about SoH:\r\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb680833.aspx"
