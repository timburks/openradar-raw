    description: "Summary: Signed up for iCloud during beta to test it. Used a secondary Apple ID. Subscribed to iTunes Match ($25). Upgraded my storage to 10GB ($20). Now I want to migrate my MobileMe account and I'll lose all of it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Pay for MobileMe. Help test iCloud. Try to migrate MobileMe to iCloud on launch, merging both accounts.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: There should be a way to merge Apple IDs.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No way to merge. Data loss. Two accounts. Lost money.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a serious issue. There should be a way to merge Apple IDs regardless of iClouds or MobileMesâ€¦ It can't really be that hard: mass assign purchases to a new ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you."
