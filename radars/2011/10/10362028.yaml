    description: "Summary:\r\nApps that like to operate on the currently selected item(s) in the Finder don't work reliably in Lion any more due to this bug in Finder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nLaunch Script Editor and enter this little script, keep it ready for running (no need to save it):\r\n  on run\r\n    tell application \"Finder\" to get selection\r\n  end run\r\n\r\nNext, open a new window in Finder, e.g. by first closing all windows, then pressing Cmd-Shift-A to open the Apps folder.\r\n\r\nSelect any item in the window.\r\n\r\nSwitch to Script Editor and run the script.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe results in the script editor should show the path of the selected item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe result is either empty or it shows the path of the folder of the window, but not the selected item in it.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\nOnce you switch back to the finder and then back to the script editor, without modifying the selection in the Finder, another run of the script will show the expected path of the selection, finally.\r\n\r\nThis shows that the Finder can indeed deliver the correct selection to apps, but only after a re-activation or additional selection changes.\r\n\r\nThis makes getting the Finder selection pretty unreliable. Please fix.\r\n\r\nNote: I am using 4 spaces. If you can't reproduce it, make sure you have more than one."
