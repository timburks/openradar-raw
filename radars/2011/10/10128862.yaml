    description: "When an app is suspended whilst playing a movie delivered via HTTP Live Streaming to an MPMoviePlayerController data is silently downloaded in the background if the user changes from using a Wifi network to a 3G network or vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis occurs even when the app has not opted-in to any background tasks by including the UIBackgroundModes key in the app's info.plist.\r\n\r\nThis is Not Good as the user has no way to know that audio/video data is being downloaded and it can only be stopped by forcibly terminating the app. It is Particularly Bad if the user is using a cellular connection and has exceeded their monthly allowance for data as they could incur very large data bills without knowing why.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a new iPhone project.\r\n- Add the MediaPlayer framework.\r\n- Initialise a MPMoviePlayerController with the URL to a HTTP Live Streaming video.\r\n- Add the MPMoviePlayerController's view to the view hierarchy (it doesn't seem to happen when using a MPMoviePlayerViewController).\r\n- Run the app whilst watching traffic using a proxy (such as Charles)\r\n- See video data being downloaded\r\n- Suspend the app\r\n- See video data stop\r\n- Toggle wifi off and on again\r\n- See video data start being downloaded again silently in the background\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen the app is suspended it should no longer download any data unless it has explicitly opted in to one of the supported 'background modes'.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhen the app is suspended and the user's network state changes data is downloaded in the background.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis only seems to happen when using an MPMoviePlayerController whose view is added to a custom view hierarchy. It doesn't seem to happen when using a MPMoviePlayerViewController. I've observed this on iPhones and iPads running various versions of iOS4, but on iOS5 beta 7 it seems to only download a single video segment once it starts silently downloading data again."
