    description: "When setting up a UIScrollView instance in Interface Builder, it should be possible to completely configure the control â€” currently, the contentSize property is not configurable, and placing subviews inside the scroll view does not alter the contentSize either. \r\n\r\nThis means that it is necessary to configure the control using code every time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Drag a UIScrollView to your Interface Builder canvas;\r\n2. Insert subviews inside the scroll view, with at least one of them partially or fully outside the bounds of the original scrollview;\r\n3. Simulate the document.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe scroll view should provide a value inspector to modify the contentSize property, or automatically adjust the contentSize based upon the scroll view's subviews.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe views outside the scroll view's bounds are not shown, and the scrolling controls are not available, as the contentSize is clipped to the view's bounds size by default.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNo, this behaviour has been consistent in previous releases of Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
