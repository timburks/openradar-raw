    description: "Summary: It would be very nice if the state of the various read state from iTunes via iCloud. You could start to listen to a podcast or a video in iTunes, stop in the middle of it, and start again at the same position on you iOS devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Start a podcast on iTunes, stop midway thru. Start that same podcast on you iOS devices.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: You playback start at the position you stopped in iTunes.\r\n\r\nActual Results: You need to sync your iOS devices, a long and relatively painful process compared to wireless synching.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
