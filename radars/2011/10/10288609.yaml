    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe built-in code snippets contain many useful C constructs such as for loops, if else statements, etc. Unfortunately, the indent style if these snippets may not match the coding style required by the user or organization. Furthermore, the built-in snippets cannot be edited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In Xcode 4.2, open a file in the source editor\r\n2. Type \"ifelse\" (without the quotes)\r\n3. Press \"enter\" to accept the suggested completion.\r\n4. Note the formatting of the inserted snippet\r\n    if (<#condition#>) {\r\n        <#statements-if-true#>\r\n    } else {\r\n        <#statements-if-false#>\r\n    }\r\n\r\n5. Note that the position of the opening brace does not match my organization's coding style guidelines.\r\n6. Look frantically (but thoroughly) through Xcode's menus, preferences and documentation for any way to change the formatting of inserted code snippets.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSome way of specifying the formatting of if-else blocks and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo way to specify formatting of if-else blocks and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNote that Xcode 3 had a user default called XCCodeSenseFormattingOptions which allowed the user many options \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf the built-in code snippets could be edited, I could change them all to match our house coding style. Unfortunately, clicking  on the \"edit\" button of any built-in code snippet does not actually allow editing."
