    description: "Summary:In the notification center, when many notifications are listed, users should be able to dismiss a single notification in a group without clearing all notifications in a group.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Receive multiple notifications in a single group\r\n2. Pull down notification center from top of screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA user should be able to dismiss a single notification without having to clear the entire group of messages with the 'clear' button in the group header.  This could be done with the swipe-to-delete moniker that so many users are already familiar with in tableviews.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAttempts to remove a single notification without tapping on the notification and visiting the corresponding app will fail.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niOS 5 Beta 1+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would be particularly useful for notifications that have already been checked on another device or notifications that users simply do not care about (spam from mail), etc."
