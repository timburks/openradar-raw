    description: "25-Oct-2011 10:39 AM Aidan Steele:\r\nSummary:\r\nUIScreen provides an overscan compensation property that allows developers to designate which form of overscan compensation they would like to utilise within their application. There is no method of specifying that no compensation is desired.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIScreenOverscanCompensation enum type would provide a UIScreenOverscanCompensationNone option.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIScreenOverscanCompensation provides no such option. Supplying an integer constant \"3\" achieves the desired result, but this is undocumented and subject to change and hence third-party developers cannot rely upon it."
