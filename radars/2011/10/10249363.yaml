    description: "Summary:\r\niPhone developers are highly encouraged to test their applications on a real device before deploying to the App Store. The iPhone 4S has a dual core processor and is a new class of device unlike any developers have to test with currently. On October 14th, the iPhone will launch and users will be installing applications that are untested on this device class, and it is critical that developers have the devices as soon as possible to correct any issues. Unfortunately, every year the Apple Store becomes unstable and developers are unable to purchase devices critical to testing their applications and improving user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Develop software.\r\n2. Cause Apple to create a revision in hardware.\r\n3. Understand the need to test your software on the new hardware.\r\n4. Try to get the new hardware.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnderstanding that developer's apps are critical to the iPhone ecosystem, developers are provided with two promotional codes to preorder devices three hours before the general public. These promotional codes can only be used with a credit card in the developer account holder's name, or with the developer's address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n404.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/jeff_lamarche/status/122221769020030976\r\nhttps://twitter.com/fraserspeirs/status/122218560008368128\r\nhttps://twitter.com/_soaps/status/122216082172940288\r\nhttps://twitter.com/janeylicious/status/122220623123578880\r\nhttps://twitter.com/janeylicious/status/122224383786889216\r\nhttps://twitter.com/jeff_lamarche/status/122225328830676993"
