    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Image with String patch sometimes crops the descenders of lowercase glyphsâ€” the bottom parts of letters like {j,q,p,y}.\r\n\r\nI've played around with using non-zero Width and Height inputs and they can't help with this. Problem is independent of font face input too. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached composition\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nNo cropping of letters in resultant image\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nAt smaller sizes there is cropping\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNotes: Just in case, I'm on 10.5.8,  QC 3."
