    description: "Summary: I often find the four-finger gestures disorienting when I try to swipe left or right between apps. I think a big part of this is that the animations when switching between apps don't match up with the gestures themselves. The animated transition shows the previous app moving off to the left. But to get back to it I have to swipe the other way, revealing that app on the right.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On iPad 2, open the Settings app and go to General.\r\n2. Make sure Multitasking Gestures are enabled.\r\n3. Open an app that has the ability to open a second app. For example, open the Music app and then tap the Store button. (Alternatively, you could switch between apps by double-tapping the home button, and choosing one from the list.)\r\n4. Note how the app is pushed off to the left, then toward the back. Even as it fades out, it remains very much on the left half of the screen.\r\n5. Slide four (or five) fingers from left to right, in an attempt to reveal the app that was pushed off to the left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The previous app should be revealed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The screen bounces back into place, indicating you can't go further in that direction.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes: I think the problem here is the animation when switching between apps without a gesture. The direction of the gestures makes sense because it matches the placement of the icons in the recent apps list. That helps to give users a sense of where things are. But that animation of the app being pushed to the left and then back is fighting that sense of space. If apps were pushed off to the right, it would match up with everything else, and it getting back to the previous app would make much more sense."
