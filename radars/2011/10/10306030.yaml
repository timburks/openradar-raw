    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe icons for the Xcode Installer and the Xcode app are identical. This leads to confusion because the App Store shows me that \"Xcode\" is installed, when in reality only the installer has been placed in /Applications. The confusion is compounded by the fact that the name of the download in the App Store is \"Xcode\", not \"Xcode Installer\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInstall Xcode from the App Store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere should be some kind of visual and/or textual clue that an Installer was downloaded, not the application itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe App Store install process makes you think that the application was installed/updated. In reality the only thing that's happened is that there is an updated installer in your applications folder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshot:\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/XcodeIcons.png"
