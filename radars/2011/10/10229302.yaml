    description: "Sometimes, the Home button on my iPhone 4 is very unresponsive. Sometimes it doesn't work at all, sometimes with a delay. This problem got worse (or I should say: I really noticed it) since upgrading to iOS 5 beta.\r\n\r\nI heard similar complaints from virtually every iPhone 4 user on iOS 5 beta (more than 10 at least)."
