    description: "09-Oct-2011 10:30 PM Joe Hannon:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf the timezone in the profile page of your MobileMe account page does not match the timezone your iOS device is in, then when the scheduled appointment syncs to that device, it does so at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a MobileMe account, and an iPhone or other device that syncs its calendar to that account.\r\n2. Set MobileMe Profile to one timezone (say, UTC - 8 = pacific time).\r\n3. Take your iPhone to another timezone (say, UTC - 5 = eastern time).\r\n4. Enter an appointment on the device at, say, 8 am.\r\n5. Allow time for the sync to roundtrip the appointment to the server and back.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe appointment will remain at the time entered, (8 am local time on the device in the eastern time zone).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe appointment's time shifts to 11 am after syncing with the server.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
