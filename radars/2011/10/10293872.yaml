    description: "Summary: While iCal recently got a makeover with its leather design, the vibrating alarm clock alert hasn't changed since Mac OS 10.4. It is an ugly GIF file that looks like its from the last century.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Set an alert for any event. Wait for the alert to appear. Observe the GIF file. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: Since this is Apple, one would expect a nicely done animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results: We see an ugly alarm clock with a very poor color palette.\r\n\r\nRegression: Not aware of any regression, though in Mac OS 10.4 it was a Quicktime Movie. In 10.5 it was converted to a GIF.\r\n\r\nNotes: Perhaps a visual designer could spend about ten minutes on a new icon. The current file is located at: /System/Library/CoreServices/iCalAlarm.app/Contents/Resources/AlarmClock.gif and is also attached for your viewing pleasure."
