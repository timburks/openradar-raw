    description: "Summary: When the phone is in vibration mode, you shouldn't be able to ear the confirmation sound.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Put your phone in vibration mode, press-and-hold the home button to call Siri.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Siri vibrate the phone when it's ready to ear you.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The same sound is played whether the phone is in vibration mode or not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: Since the time you need to press the home button to enable Siri is way less than with voice control, it's easier to enable it accidently. So if you enable it accidently, it may make sounds that you don't want to make in certain situation (just happened to me). \r\n\r\nI understand that things that when there's certain task, when asked explicitly, should make sounds even in vibration mode (play a video, music). However, with Siri the accidental factor is too big."
