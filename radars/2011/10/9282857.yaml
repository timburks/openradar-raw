    description: "Summary: Images synced from either Aperture or iPhoto to iPad results in extreme compression artifacts not seen when saving the same image from email or the web.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a library in Aperture or iPhoto. Sync that library to your iPad. Email the same photos to yourself to save them on the iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Images should be identical.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The synced images show greater incidence in compression artifacts, oftentimes hampering use of the photo.\r\n\r\nRegression: Has always happened, but it's gotten so frustrating when attempting to use the iPad for a potential portfolio platform that I've decided to file it as a bug.\r\n\r\nNotes: Maybe some sort of compression level slider in the photo syncing panel? If there's an undocumented plist string I can tweak, I'd also be most grateful. \r\n\r\nAttached: Sample images. Notice the striped pattern overlay on the \"Field\" image (the pattern has been compressed to hell in the synced version), and the \"Blue Gradient\" image also shows significant artifacts.\r\n\r\n(sample images in both emailed and synced states were attached to the radar; one was a photograph with a diagonal 1px black line pattern across it, and the other was a digitally-rendered Aqua-esque blue pattern)"
