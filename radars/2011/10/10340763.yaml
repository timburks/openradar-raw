    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOut of the blue, Camera Roll and Photo Stream appear blank in the Photos list. Attempting to access them crashes the Photos app.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, any other app from which I try to pick photos will also crash when I do so. The Camera app also crashes when trying to save a photo. These are hard crashes, taking me back to the home screen immediately.\r\n\r\nRebooting the phone had no effect."
