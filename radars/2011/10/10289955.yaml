    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen moving to iCloud, my Facebook calendar URL was unusable after the migration. I realized some characters in the URL were percent-encoded, which is not appropriate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In iCal, add a MobileMe calendar subscription with a URL containing \"?\" or \"&\".\r\n2. Move to iCloud.\r\n3. Witness the URL has been mangled, with \"?\" and \"&\" replaced with their percent-encoded siblings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nwebcal://www.facebook.com/ical/u.php?uid=42&key=seventeen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMissed the event of a lifetime. Oh, you want the URL:\r\n\r\nwebcal://www.facebook.com/ical/u.php%3Fuid=42%26key=seventeen\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes? Things worked great in MobileMe.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
