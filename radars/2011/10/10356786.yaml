    description: "Summary:\r\n  Xcode loses custom color and font settings after restarting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n  I've attached a series of screen shots to help illustrate. Steps are:\r\n\r\n1. Open Xcode with any cocoa project (mine happens to be an iPhone project)\r\n2. Open Xcode preferences\r\n3. Select Fonts & Colors tab\r\n4. Click on + button to add a theme\r\n5. I chose Sunset\r\n6. Select the newly added theme in the left pane\r\n7. Customize some editor font or color settings\r\n8. View source code file, settings will have been applied.\r\n9. Quit Xcode\r\n10. Reopen Xcode and the last opened project.\r\n11. Color and font settings are gone. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n  I would expect the settings applied in step 7 above to remain unless I change the settings again or change the selected theme.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n  Actual result were the theme added in steps 4-6 above is gone. And Xcode falls back to the first theme in the list (on the left pane). So my source code is style according to that theme, and not the custom theme.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n  I noticed the same scenario worked on Xcode 4.2 4C199 on Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n Attached RTF configuration file below as well."
