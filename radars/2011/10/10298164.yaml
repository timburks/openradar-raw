    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the system region format \"Germany\", Xcode does immediately crash when using the new Debug=>Simulate Location feature with a custom GPX file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the attached GPX file and switch the system region to Germany.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should just work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes with an exception (see attached)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI assume the German decimal comma (and dot for the thousands delimiter) is causing the problem."
