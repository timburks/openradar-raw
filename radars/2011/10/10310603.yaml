    description: "19-Oct-2011 02:23 PM Sam Deane:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOne of the most common problems I find when switching between testing on the simulator and testing on the device is the fact that the device's file system appears to be case-sensitive, whereas the simulator uses the user's default file system which generally isn't.\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me that the simulator could instead create and mount a private DMG disk image to use as the simulated device's disk. It would then be able to format this image using a case-sensitive file system, which might provide a more realistic simulation of an actual device's behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
