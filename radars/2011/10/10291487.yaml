    description: "15-Oct-2011 10:58 AM Thomas Joulin:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSince iOS5, there is a gap between the Documents (backed up by iCloud but cause of app rejection if too big), and the Caches (not backed up but might be cleared without warning) folders.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Store files in cache folder of an app\r\n- Fill up iPhone storage\r\n- Observe cleaning behavior\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCaches folder not touched\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCaches folder emptied\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nFiles lossed between iOS4 and iOS5 behaviors\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nApplications rely on the Caches folder for offline capabilities. There should be an Offline folder with limited allowed size, where Applications can safely store files that will not be deleted nor be backed up."
