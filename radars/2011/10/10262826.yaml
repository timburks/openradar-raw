    description: "10-Oct-2011 04:31 PM Mark Hughes:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAll devices go off at once when an event occurs\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Own an iPhone, iPad, one or more Macs synced to MobileMe/iCloud.\r\n2) Schedule an appointment in iCal, with an alarm.\r\n3) Wait for appointment.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n4) Only one device in each geographical location, chosen by which you have most recently used, plays the audible alert.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n4) Every device you own beeps and chirps and demands that you handle an alert box before it'll go away.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nObviously, requires location for devices. But a rough check should be fine for eliminating most of the duplication."
