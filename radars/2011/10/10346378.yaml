    description: "Summary: Alert Sounds, whether actual alert sounds or effects played by applications through the same api, do not play after waking a machine running Lion from sleep. This includes items like the \"shutter\" sound when creating a screen capture (cmd-shift-3) or any audio cue for an event in iChat (like a new message arrived or an invite to a video chat, etc).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Let the machine running Lion go into sleep mode for at least an hour (may occur with less time, but that's been my shortest test case, usually it's 5-7 hours) and then wake the machine up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: alert sounds, event effects and iChat audio cues should play\r\n\r\nActual Results: these sounds do not play.\r\n\r\nRegression: This is 100% reproducible on both my 2 x 3Ghz quad core xeon Mac Pro and Early 2011 MacBook Pro. This has been happening since the release version of 10.7, and continued through 10.7.1 and into the current 10.7.2 (11C74).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI found through trial and error that if I performed the following steps I can resolve my iChat alert and system wide sound effects not playing problem :\r\n\r\n\t1.\tOpen System Preferences, click on the Sound pane.\r\n\t2.\tSelect a new “alert sound”\r\n\t3.\tChange the “Play sound effects through” device selection\r\n\t4.\tRestore both to their original values and close the preferences window."
