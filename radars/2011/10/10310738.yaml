    description: "Summary: The file paths obtained from com.apple.iApps.plist cannot be accessed by a sandboxed application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Provide entitlement to access user's ~/Library/Preferences/ folder in order to access the com.apple.iApps.plist. Retrieve the value for \"iTunesRecentDatabasePaths\" from com.apple.iApps.plist by any means. Attempt to access the file path represented by the value.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The ability to access files at the location.\r\n\r\nActual Results: If the file does not reside in ~/Music/iTunes/, which is likely if the user has used the iTunes multiple library feature, access to this location is denied. This location cannot be anticipated by the developer in order to enable entitlements for it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: According to Apple's own documentation, the purpose of the \"iTunes Library.xml\" file is to allow access by third-party applications. This is not possible under sandboxing if the file resides outside of ~/Music/iTunes/ (which can be accessed via entitlements)."
