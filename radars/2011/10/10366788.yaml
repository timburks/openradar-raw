It lets me create cards, but fails to let me purchase them, saying my account settings are not complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format: Set this value to something other than your iTunes account. (Mine was set to United Kingdom.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. I expect prices in Cards to still be in Hong Kong dollars, since that's where my iTunes account is registered, and that's where my credit card is. Also, it's where I happen to live.\r\n\r\n2. I also expect to be able to buy cards.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Prices shows in Pounds sterling.\r\n\r\n2. I'm not able to buy cards after being prompted for apple-id and CCV code. I'm told my account is lacking a setting. (See attached file.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI don't think the Cards application should make assumptions on billing currency based on my preferred date, time and phone number format settings."
