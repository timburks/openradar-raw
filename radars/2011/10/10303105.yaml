    description: "We have a very useful \"Jump to Definition\" command in Xcode. It would be nice to have an inverse, a \"Jump to Callers\" command. You could invoke it on a method signature and it would show a list of everywhere Xcode knows of that this method was called from. Bonus points for the following:\r\n\r\n1. Figuring out a method is a Cocoa delegate method and saying it is Cocoa that calls it\r\n2. Detecting notification response methods and showing where the notification is sent from\r\n3. Ability to bring up a preview of the caller line and surrounding lines in a popover (think a cross between the find and replace preview and the code completion quick help)"
