    description: "11-Oct-2011 09:22 PM Douwe Maan:\r\nSummary:\r\nProtected Mail folders, such as Inbox, Sent and Trash, are not supposed to be renamed or moved. This is why when you tap the Edit button while showing the list of Mailboxes, the table rows for those items are grayed out, and tapping them doesn't do anything. When tapping any of the other table rows, an \"Edit Mailbox\" view slides in where you can rename or move the mailbox in question. There is, however, a way to get this \"Edit Mailbox\" view to show illegally for those protected folders I mentioned, as I will describe below.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure you have a Mail account set up. (I only tested with IMAP, could be POP3 works as well.)\r\n2. Select the account in Mail.app's Mailboxes list, below the \"Accounts\" header.\r\n3. Touch down using your finger on the table row for one of the protected folders, let's say Inbox.\r\n3. Tap the Edit button in the upper right corner with another finger, while still holding the table row with the first finger.\r\n4. Remove your first finger of the screen, so the app records a \"touch up inside\" event on the table row.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing happens, and no \"Edit Mailbox\" view shows up. This is what would happen if you were to tap the table row item for the protected folder after tapping the Edit button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Edit Mailbox\" view for the protected mailbox slides in, allowing the user to rename or move the protected mailbox.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile the \"Edit Mailbox\" view does show up for the protected mailbox, when editing either the name of the mailbox or moving it and then tapping the Save button, an alert shows up telling you the action could not be completed on the server. Because of this, no real harm can be done (I could imagine Mail.app not understanding why the Inbox folder would suddenly be gone, for example), but I still think this should be fixed as the user is not supposed to even be able to show this \"Edit Mailbox\" view for protected mailboxes.\r\n\r\n13-Jun-2012 04:27 AM Douwe Maan:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
