Install iPhoneCoreDataRecipes on multiple devices.\r\n2. Make many simultaneous edits which may cause merge conflicts.\r\n3. Continue doing so until all saves fail on at least one device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nStep 3 will never occur.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nStep 3 occurs frequently, causing the path to become unusable.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/554294#554294"
