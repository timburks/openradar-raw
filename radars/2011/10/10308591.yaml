    description: "Summary: When sending a push notification to a device running iOS 5.0 with action-loc-key = null, the OS displays an alert view containing two buttons \"Close\" and \"Launch\" instead of the expected \"OK\".  On iOS 4.0, the same push notification only displays a single button \"OK\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) The app must NOT be in the foreground (it should be in the background or not running)\r\n2) Set the app to display the \"Alert\" style push notification view in Settings -> Notifications\r\n3) Send a push containing the following JSON: {\"aps\":{\"alert\":{\"body\":\"This is a push notification.\",\"action-loc-key\":null}}}\r\n4) Observe an alert view containing two buttons: \"Close\" and \"Launch\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results: An alert view should display only one button \"OK\".\r\n\r\nActual Results: An alert view shows two buttons: \"Close\" and \"Launch\".\r\n\r\nRegression: The incorrect two-button view shows in iOS 5.0.  The correct single-button view shows in iOS 4.2.1 running on another test device.\r\n\r\nNotes: None."
