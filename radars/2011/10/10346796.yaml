    description: "iCloud has duplicated my bookmarks and bookmark folders many times (still investigating why it did that). Now I cleaned all the bookmarks on my Mac but iCloud keeps syncing the old data and the deleted bookmarks reappear. On the icloud.com website, I found no way to reset the bookmarks. The iCloud pref pane doesn't offer any help either.\r\n\r\nThere should be a button on icloud.com to reset all bookmarks."
