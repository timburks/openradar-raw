    description: "Summary: \r\nIf using a computer on a local network for subversion, the bonjour name is not translated into an IP address, leaving the svn repository inaccessible\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Xcode 4.2 organizer, click Add repository.... Enter a name, and enter the location of the (already set-up and functioning svn repository) that resides on another computer on the local network. Enter the address in the form \"svn+ssh://patrik@iceman.local/svn\", where iceman.local is the bonjour name of the remote computer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe setup should progress to the next step.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGet the error message \"Host is unreachable\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI am pretty sure that this was not a problem using Xcode 4.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf entering the IP address of the repository instead of the bonjour name, it works as expected, thus the translation seems to be the problem.\r\n\r\nImportant note: For already present repositories in the organizer that reference the remote repository using bonjour name, it is not possible to commit changes since the repos is unreachable."
