    description: "13-Oct-2011 04:13 PM Steven Fisher:\r\nSummary:\r\nRight clicking anything in the source list of iTunes while the window is not frontmost shows the wrong context menu, which contains only Eject Disc. Eject Disc does not function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run iTunes.\r\n2. Choose iTunes->About iTunes.\r\n3. Without clicking on it first, right click on Podcasts.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Open in New Window\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Eject Disc\" (which does not, in fact, eject the disc)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe example steps above are contrived. This also happens if another application is foremost, rather than the About window. For instance, I'd clicked Podcasts hoping to see a \"Refresh\" item while working in Xcode."
