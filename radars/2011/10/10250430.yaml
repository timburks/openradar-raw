    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease document and support the following UIImage private class method:\r\n+ (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)name inBundle:(NSBundle *)bundle;\r\n\r\nThis is very useful when using a static library with a resources bundle. There is already bundle support for UINib and UIViewController, we need it for UIImage too."
