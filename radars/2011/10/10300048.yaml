    description: "Summary: iPhone 4S can't disable manually the 3G network in Settings > General > Network like other devices. This is useful primarily for battery life reason. Also, when the 3G network is present but very weak compared to the EDGE network, it might be preferable to switch to EDGE.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open your new iPhone 4S. Leave the house for a really long day.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Have the ability to switch to EDGE for better battery life.\r\n\r\nActual Results: You're stuck with 3G.\r\n\r\nRegression: It was available to all older devices than the CDMA iPhone 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
