    description: "Summary: The distinction between the MAS and the system Software update is not clear to users. \r\n\r\nAt first it was ok. You had you 1st and 3rd party software that you bought on the MAS and system software in Software Update.\r\n\r\nBut then when Lion came out and has been distributed via the MAS, but updates to Lion are in Software Update. Really not consistent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: You want to update your software.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: All the software update at the same place.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Two different place to find update, with no clear distinction.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
