    description: "Summary: New podcast episodes could be downloaded wirelessly once per day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Subscribe to a podcast, sync you iOS devices.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: New episodes are downloaded each day or when the device is charging.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No automatic download. You need to either sync you device (a slow and relatively painful process) or download them manually. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: You could download new Newsstand issues and podcasts at the same time."
