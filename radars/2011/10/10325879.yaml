    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nBug Reporter requires a \"version number\" for iCloud bugs. There is no user-visible version number for iCloud.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, filing this bug required that I enter a \"version number\" for Bug Reporter itself. This is also invisible to me. The snake is eating its own tail, oh god."
