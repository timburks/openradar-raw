Start with a clean slate (remove existing Recipes app, clean iCloud storage, change the ubiquity id and the coreDataCloudContent in code\r\n2. Install on device 1. add some data,\r\n3. Install on device 2. wait a few seconds for iCloud data to appear.\r\n4. Add some data on device 2 and see it on device1 to confirm syncing is working.\r\n5. Delete the app on device 2.\r\n6. Reinstall app on device 2.\r\n \r\nExpected Results: All iCloud data to download to device 2\r\n\r\nActual Results: Only partial iCloud data (sometimes, no data) downloads to device 2. Syncing sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.\r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/555644#555644"
