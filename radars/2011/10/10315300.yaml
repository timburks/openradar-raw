    description: "== SUMMARY ==\r\nIn version 1.1.1 (build 88) of the Mac App Store, the App Store will finish downloading and/or installing a large app only to restart the download again and again, for seemingly no reason. \r\n\r\nThere is no workaround; in my experience, I have to keep downloading the application and hope that it eventually works. \r\n\r\n== STEPS TO REPRODUCE ==\r\n1. Purchase a large application from the Mac App Store. I purchased Xcode and Mac OS X Lion. \r\n2. Wait for the download & installation to complete.\r\n\r\n== EXPECTED RESULTS ==\r\nThe application can be launched after it is downloaded and installed.\r\n\r\n== ACTUAL RESULTS ==\r\nThe application can’t be launched. The application’s icon in the launchpad disappears, and the download restarts sometimes. If the download doesn’t restart, and the user tries to restart the download from the Mac App Store app, the resume button in the Updates tab often doesn’t do anything when clicked. \r\n\r\n== REGRESSION ==\r\nSometimes, you get lucky and the download works after a few tries. Most of the times, you have to keep downloading it again and again. (I’ve been trying to download the latest Xcode update for days — I think this is the 5th or 6th download attempt.) \r\n\r\n== NOTES ==\r\nAttached is a zip file, which contains screenshots of icons in the launchpad that don’t have labels, a result of the failed download."
