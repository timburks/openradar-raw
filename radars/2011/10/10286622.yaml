    description: "14-Oct-2011 08:59 AM Travis Fischer:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere is no location an app's sandbox where you can store files that won't get backed up to iCloud that also won't get randomly deleted.  The Library/Caches and tmp folders of iOS5 are the only folder that don't get backed up to iCloud, but the Caches directory will get \"cleaned\" when an iPad's disk is full, deleting user data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Store information in the Library/Caches directory of your app.\r\n2) Fill the iPad to capacity with music, movies, and other things.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nInformation stored in Library/Caches will be persisted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApp gets \"cleaned\" and the Caches directory gets deleted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is new behavior in iOS 5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee http://www.marco.org/2011/10/13/ios5-caches-cleaning for more information.\r\n\r\nI work on an enterprise app that usually contains extremely confidential business financial data.  My users do not want this data to be backed up to iCloud, so it is stored in the Caches directory.  If Caches could be \"cleaned\" without warning, then my users will lose their data.  If my user doesn't have internet access at the time that the cleaning occurs, then they will have no way to re-download that data and cannot use our app.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a folder that apps can use that will not get backed up to iCloud but will not be cleaned that developers can use to store data."
