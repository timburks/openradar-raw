    description: "28-Nov-2010 10:31 PM Sasmito Adibowo:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMac App Store Apps should be allowed (with the user's consent, of course) to install user-level Launch Agents.  This involves writing configuration files into ~/Library/LaunchAgents which is currently forbidden according to the Mac App Store review guidelines.\r\n\r\nOne example use is for an RSS reader/client application to run a non-gui \"satellite\" executable that periodically downloads new content from the Internet in the background.  Thus whenever the user starts the GUI application, the user's news subscriptions are already updated and and the user does not need to wait for the application to fetch RSS items from the Internet.  This significantly enhances the application's usability and enhances the user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone yet."
