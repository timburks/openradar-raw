Also, if you remove an iCloud account, any data you add during the time you have to iCloud account will not be synced to iCloud, even if you log back in to iCloud.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Sign in to an iCloud account with an app that already has data in core data.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Data already in the app will sync.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Data in the app does not sync.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
