    description: "Summary:\r\nServer Assistant in 10.6 features the ability to create passphrase encrypted Auto Server Setup profiles. We would like to create our own profiles, in order to use a master template when deploying multiple servers. There is no documentation on how the passphrase is salted and hashed, or which algorithm is used to encrypt the profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Install 10.6 Server Admin Tools.\r\n• Create Auto Server Setup Profile…\r\n• Open plist and see a Base64 data blob, and an Encryption value of \"2\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• Some kind of documentation or a readable format.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• Encrypted plist with no documentation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA short comment on how the passphrase is salted and hashed, and which algorithm to use would be extremely helpful!"
