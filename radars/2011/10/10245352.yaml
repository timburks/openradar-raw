    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Homescreen overview and app listing in iTunes 10.5b9 (132) Mac, does not respect the system scroll style setting when it's set to reverse scrolling. (non natural, or PRE Lion type scrolling where finger movement is the same as scroll thumb movement) \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave an iPad rotated to landscape. Connect that iPad to iTunes 10.5b9 (132) Mac. Go to the Apps tab in iTunes. You should see the first springboard home screen and a bunch of other home screens as thumbnails below. Try to scroll in the home screen thumbnail area. Scroll direction is behaving as \"natural\" scrolling when it should be reverse (classic (or in my personal opinion correct)) scrolling.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScrolling behavior should be the same for ALL scrollbars. This scrollbar should respect the user's setting like every other scroller.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis scroller's behavior is inverted. It behaves the other way round depending on the system setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem ONLY applies to the horizontal scrollbar in the App area when connecting an iPad in landscape orientation and when having enough home screens that the scroller appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA screenshot with a red rectangle to show the exact scrollbar that has inverted behavior is attached."
