    description: "Summary: Xcode should give useful debug information when Unit Tests crash\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with unit tests\r\n2. Create a unit test that crashes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected information like \r\n(1) What unit test method crashed \r\n(2) where in that unit test it crashed at (line#)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode points to a line in a shell script that just says octest may have crashed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWithout this information its a game of whack a mole where I selectively enable/disable unit test until I figure out which one is crashing and then start to pick apart that unit test to figure out where its crashing at."
