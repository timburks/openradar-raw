    description: "Summary: Before you ask something to Siri, the audio pauses. That's great. \r\n\r\nHowever, when that audio is played via AirPlay, it's not appropriate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Play any songs, send the audio to an AirPlay speaker. Start Siri.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The audio continue playing.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The audio is stopped.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: My phone was the main audio source of a night with friends. However, when I asked Siri something, it would stop. Not the best experience..."
