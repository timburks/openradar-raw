    description: "Summary:\r\nWould like to have the ability in app store descriptions to format text in such a way that makes the description or update release notes more readable to app store users.  Currently, only plain text is supported, which give poor separation between sections or emphasis for particular sections or words.  Would like to see app store descriptions and update release notes support markdown formatting, or even just simple HTML (bold, italic, unordered lists, etc.).  This would allow developers to easily add emphasis to certain sections, or support bulleted lists without having to fetch the ascii code for a bullet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll descriptions on app store - ever.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
