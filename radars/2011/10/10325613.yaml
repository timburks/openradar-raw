    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of OS X Lion, while using a trackpad you were able to start dragging a file from the finder, and then mid-drag activate the gesture to switch between spaces or to mission control if the target you wanted to drop the file to was not visible in the current space. This is no longer possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Select a file in the Finder\r\n2) Using a multitouch trackpad, tap and begin to drag the file\r\n3) Without releasing the file, use your remaining fingers to activate the gesture to switch between spaces\r\n4) Drop the file somewhere on a different space\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 3), the gesture should be recognized and the current visible space should change\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn step 3), nothing happens and the only way to get a file to a different space is to hold it by the edge of the screen until the space changes. There's no way to drag the file into mission control and chose a target that way.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was possible in previous versions of OS X Lion (Most of the developer previews, as well as 10.7.0 and 10.7.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is possible to drag a file into an adjacent space by hovering near the edge of the screen - however, this is considerably slower than activating the gesture, especially when there are several spaces you need to traverse."
