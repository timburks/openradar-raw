    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nDepending on your region, iPad's Calendar app sets the start of the week on Sunday or Monday. The only way to change this is to change the Region in General setting to another region. This has the consequence that all phone numbers in Contacts will also be in that's region format and addresses that have no country get a country added.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) notice that in Calendar app on iPad the weeks start on Sunday, even though that is not customary in our part of Canada (Quebec)\r\n2) research a solution to change this\r\n3) set the Region format in Settings -> General -> Region Format to United Kingdom\r\n4) notice that the calendar now starts on Monday\r\n5) open Contacts app\r\n6) notice that some Canadian and US phone numbers are in UK format\r\n7) Notice that some addresses have UK added as their country if they didn't have one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere should be a setting to set the start of the week\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no such setting so users have to rely on a hack that has consequences in other areas.\r\niCal for the desktop has this, but on iDevices there is no such setting."
