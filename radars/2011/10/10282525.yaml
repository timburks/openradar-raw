    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niOS 5 added iCloud, which automatically stores and backs up content from the app's sandbox. It explicitly ignores two directories, Library/Caches/ and tmp/, similar to iTunes backups. iOS 5 also added behavior to \"clean\" the contents of these directories, so that in the case of low disk usage, this data can be removed and disk space can be saved.\r\n\r\nOne of the major features of our app is the ability to work offline by storing network content on disk. We don't want to back up or sync this data to iCloud, because the data set could be potentially very large, depending on the user's choices. Therefore, we need a location on disk that can be used for data which will not be automatically deleted, but will also not be synced or backed up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nOnly happens on iOS 5 devices.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee also: rdar://10282528"
