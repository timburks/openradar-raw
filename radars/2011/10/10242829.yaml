    description: "From time to time, especially when resuming work after a pause, iWork '09 documents under Lion 10.7.1 are non-editable. When typing a letter, nothing happens. No error message, nothing.\r\n\r\nThen after a while (10 seconds or so) editing is possible again.\r\n\r\nI suspect this has something to do with the versions feature in Lion."
