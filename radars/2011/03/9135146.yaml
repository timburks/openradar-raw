    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen Xcode 4 enters an conflicted state, it pops a window titled \"Internal Error\".  See attached screen shot.\r\n\r\nThe only way to clear this error is to use the mouse.  The UI should allow the window to be dismissed without using the mouse by associating key-strokes with the buttons.\r\n\r\nNot providing the user the ability to dismiss this window without using the mouse interrupts the user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWell, I actually don't know exactly what to do to produce a conflicted state.  This happens to me quite often (at least hourly).  I believe that if you spend any amount of time working with Xcode 4, you'll encounter this eventually.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTo be able to close this window using key-strokes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe window can not be closed, expect by using the mouse."
