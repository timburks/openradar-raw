    description: "Summary: NSTokenField needs some sort of tokenField:willDeleteObjects: delegate API.\r\n\r\nSee sample project for \r\n\r\n    http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1129406\r\n\r\nalso attached here. {OpenRadar note: since OpenRadar does not support attachments, this cannot be attached to the OpenRadar version of this bug.}\r\n\r\nIn that project, I had to implement controlTextDidChange: and go through the contents of the field editor string just to figure out if any tokens had been deleted upon user edit. I needed to do this because, for this token field, duplicate tokens are not allowed. \r\n\r\nThat's an unfortunate step, potentially fragile, that could be avoided if the token field would *tell* its delegates when it's going to delete tokens."
