    description: "NSMapTable actually responds to the -allKeys method, but it's not exposed as API in the public header so trying to use it results in compiler warnings. This would be a convenient method to have.\r\n\r\nEven though returning an array of keys could potentially create strong/rooted references to weak keys and prevent them from being automatically removed from the map table, the same could be said of adding a key for which a strong reference already exists. With reasonable user awareness, this is likely be a non-issue."
