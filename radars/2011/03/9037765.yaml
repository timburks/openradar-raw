    description: "Summary:\r\nOlder Mac developer tools and text editors have had key bindings for command-up/down arrow that move the cursor approximately a screen-full at a time, but Xcode 4 has nothing similar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI think the best behavior is to have command-up arrow go to the top of the screen, then repeated command-up arrows scroll up a page with the cursor moved to the top line (similar for down).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe only vertical cursor movement bindings I see in Xcode 4 is paragraph-wise (whatever that is), and beginning/end of document.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYes, I used MPW and I try to replicate it's key navigation scheme in every text editor I use.\r\n\r\nXcode's default key bindings make sense with respect to an abstract consistency, with command key meaning \"to the end\" option key meaning \"by smaller unit\" (word / paragraph). Unfortunately, vertical & horizontal aren't analogous in the case of narrow, arbitrarily tall text files.\r\n\r\nInstead, I think it makes more sense when the screenful is the basis of consistency, where command key sort of means to move to the visible extent. \"Sort of\" because there's more options for moving sub-chunks left or right, moving to the left or right edge of the screen on long lines turns out not to be useful. Instead, command left & right moving the beginning & end of the line fits the mental model where you imagine you have a window wide enough to fit those long lines. For document type that are arbitrarily wide as well arbitrarily tall, I would expect command left & right to move to the horizontal edges of the screen and then scroll just like I'm suggesting command up & down do, and so the screenful metaphor would be less strained.\r\n\r\nWhile I guess I'm arguing that the key bindings I'm used to make more sense, I don't truly care to lobby for changing your default bindings. I just hope to be able to customize the bindings to have this behavior."
