    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nGarageband for iPad has absolutely awesome support for external USB MIDI keyboards; you can record and play back music easily. However, Garageband could really do with a 'note' view, similar to that available on the Mac version of Garageband.\r\n\r\nPlease add a note/'sheet music' view for your Piano-recorded tracks in GarageBand for iPad. It will make a huge difference to those learning how to play the piano, whether it's using the virtual keyboard or a real MIDI piano.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
