    description: "Notes:\r\n\r\nWhy isn't more  long-form documentation available in the ePub format used by iBooks? It's pretty safe to assume a huge majority of Mac and iOS developers have an iPad and like to use it for technical documentation. Searching for \"Apple Developer Publications\" in iBooks results in only six books. That's a great start, but there is still a lot of documentation available only in PDF.\r\n\r\nPDF is, of course, an option for iBooks. But turns out to be unsuitable because there is no back button. If you click a link in the PDF file, it's a one way proposition. And for technical documentation, that's a deal killer.\r\n\r\nePub also has the advantage of better font control and image viewing."
