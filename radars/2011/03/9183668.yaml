    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt would be highly useful to have a manual way to force symbolication of crash logs from organiser. Currently logs are meant to symbolicate automatically, but we often find that they do not. Sometimes logs do symbolicate, but not until Xcode has been restarted, or they symbolicate after a seemingly random period of time (perhaps after spotlight has finally indexed the .dSYM. Delayed symbolication seems to happen more in Xcode4. These  delays severely slow our workflow when debugging crashes. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if we were able to select a .crash file and a .dSYM file and manually symbolicate (and see any resulting errors)."
