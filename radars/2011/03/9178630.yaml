    description: "23-Mar-2011 05:22 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nXcode 4 has been released. The iOS program portal user guide still describes the use of Xcode 3.x.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Log in to the iOS developer center and visit the provisioning portal at <http://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action>.\r\n\r\n2. Click the link labeled \"Program User Guide\". As of today this links to <http://adcdownload.apple.com/ios/ios_developer_program_user_guide/ios_developer_program_user_guide__standard_program_v2.7__final_9110.pdf>.\r\n\r\n3. Review the document and observe that instructions and screenshots relate to Xcode 3.x, not to Xcode 4. For example, instructions and screenshots covering selecting a provisioning profile on pages 38-41.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen I need to learn how to do something in Xcode, the documentation would be relevant.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI went right to the instructions to learn how to do something and found that they were out of date.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nObviously this is not a problem with Xcode 3.x, because the documentation is accurate for people still using old versions of Xcode."
