    description: "Summary: When downloading an app it will sometimes get \"stuck\" on the last step of installation. The progress bar is complete, but it says \"Installing\" for a long time after that, often requiring the device to be restarted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download an app from the App Store. (The Target app for iPhone is one I've had this problem with, though it doesn't seem to be app-specific.)\r\n2. Wait for it to install.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The app should finish installing shortly after the progress bar is full.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Sometimes it continues to say \"Installing\" long after the progress bar is complete. I've had it stay this way for as long as 15 minutes before giving up and restarting the device. As soon as I restart, the app is installed, though usually in a different location than it was previously. Other times the install will successfully complete after simply waiting a few minutesâ€”longer than normal but with no extra action required.\r\n\r\nRegression: I first noticed this problem recently in iOS 4.3, though another user told me it happened in 4.2.1 for them. This makes me wonder if it's related to a recent App Store change, rather than a change in iOS itself.\r\n\r\nNotes: I haven't found a way to reproduce the problem reliably, but I've had it happen quite a few times in the past week or so. It has happened on my iPhone 4 and my iPad 2, on 3G and on Wi-Fi."
