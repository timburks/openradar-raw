    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUITableViewCell should exclude subclasses of UIControl from the logic that automatically sets the \"selected\" state when a cell is touched. This is problematic for subclasses of UIControl, such as UIButton, because they will switch their visible state when the table cell is touched instead of only when the user taps inside just that UIControl. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Put a UIButton in a UITableViewCell with distinct normal and selected states (particularly with images).\r\n\r\n2. Tap the cell\r\n\r\n3. The button also highlights with the cell instead of just staying like it was\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe button should remain in it's normal state\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe button switches to it's selected state as if the user touched the button as well. \r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nI've tried a few things to get around this, but all are just hacks. The one that's working for me right now is to subclass UIButton and to override touchesBegan/touchesCancelled/touchesEnded. Initially, the button has the same image for all UIControl states. On touches began, the highlighted and selected states have their images changed to the down state versions. On touchesEnded/touchesCancel, the up image is reset for the highlighted and selected states. \r\n\r\nThis solution has a small problem if the user taps too quickly and the run loop doesn't get a chance to redraw and the button never appears to press, even though the action fires."
