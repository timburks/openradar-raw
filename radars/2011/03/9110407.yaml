    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nIt seems that XCode 4 has no Perforce support. Unfortunately SVN and/or Git aren't suitable replacements for large-scale projects with lots of binary files, so it's impossible for my company to switch to a different SCM solution.\r\nI believe XCode 4 would be a much better product if it would support the #1 SCM system used in professional game developement, like previous versions did.\r\nThanks for listening."
