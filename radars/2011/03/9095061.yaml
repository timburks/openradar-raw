    description: "Summary:\r\nLaunchd provides methods for running login scripts, programs, etc., through its RunAtLoad method.  It would be nice if there were counterpart Arguments that could be used to run a program or task at shutdown and/or logout.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSet up a script/process with a launchd item and have it execute as the user is logging out and/or as the machine is shutting down, to perform various services previously (and currently) handled by rc.shutdown.local or other hacky methods.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
