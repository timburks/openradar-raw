    description: "Summary:\r\nAccording to the NSManagedObjectID class documentation:\r\n\r\n\"Object IDs can be transformed into a URI representation which can be archived and recreated later to refer back to a given object (using managedObjectIDForURIRepresentation: (NSPersistentStoreCoordinator) and objectWithID: (NSManagedObjectContext). For example, the last selected group in an application could be stored in the user defaults through the group object’s ID. You can also use object ID URI representations to store “weak” relationships across persistent stores (where no hard join is possible).\"\r\n\r\nThis is misleading since object ids appear to change during migrations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) store an object id\r\n2) migrate to a new data model version\r\n3) attempt to restore object by id\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe object is restored\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA different object is restored (these results may vary, but in my test, i'm getting a different object back.)"
