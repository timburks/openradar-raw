    description: "Xcode 4's Scheme drop down menu would be much more useable if it was split into two menus - one to select the Scheme, and one to select the Destination.\r\n\r\nAs it is, for an iOS target with a deployment target of 4.0 you get 7 separate menu items for every single scheme which very quickly clogs the menu and makes it difficult to quickly change schemes. Splitting the two up does not go against the driving motivation of Schemes (getting rid of the Target/Build Config mess of Xcode 3) because it will always be necessary to select a Destination separate of the Scheme."
