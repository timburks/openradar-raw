    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of Xcode, through 3.2.6, gave the user the power to choose the best tool for their needs, via a preferences UI which allowed configuration of specific applications for specific file types. So, for example, one could configure all text files to open in BBEdit (or TextWrangler) if desired. In Xcode 4.0, this is no longer possible -- all files open in Xcode, and there is no means for the user to choose their desired tool for the job.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch Xcode 4.0.\r\n\r\n2. Identify a source file in the project navigator.\r\n\r\n3. Double-click on that file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected file to open in BBEdit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFile opens in Xcode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBehaves as expected in Xcode 3.x (including 3.2.6). The older version provides a UI in the \"File Types\" preferences, but those settings do not appear to be honored in Xcode 4, and there is no alternative UI for configuring an external editor."
