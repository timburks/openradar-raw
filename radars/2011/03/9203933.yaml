    description: "Summary: Since Mac OS X 10.5 the text \"Missing Plug-in\" (formerly accompanied by a blue brick icon) shows up randomly instead of attachments. It seems to happen particularly often when composing signatures.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Mail preferences and create new signature, add an image to it (I did it with a small PNG screenshot image, but other kinds may work too) either by copying and pasting or drag and drop. Switch to another signature, insert an image, switch back, insert one more, create one more signature, etc. until the \"Missing Plug-in\" text appears. If it doesn't happen, quit Mail and start over. Once it starts to happen it seems to happen with all newly inserted images. Sometimes images already present in signatures are shown as \"Missing Plug-in\" just after launching Mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Images should always display correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Under unpredictable circumstances, the text \"Missing Plug-in\" images is displayed instead of images.\r\n\r\nRegression: Nothing special that I know of. I do have some common Internet plug-ins installed, namely Flip4Mac (WMV), Flash, RealPlayer, and the plug-ins that come with Mac OS X. None of them except QuickTime is associated with common image file types. The issue is replicable without any Mail plug-ins installed.\r\n\r\nNotes: This seems to be a transient, but fairly common problem:\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.info.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2454737&start=45&tstart=0\r\nhttp://discussions.info.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2462812&start=30&tstart=0\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the \"solutions\" presented in the threads above don't have any effect whatsoever. I also haven't seen the \"Missing Plug-in\" text instead of images in any other WebKit based applications (including web browsers), it happens only in Mail."
