Run the attached sample app. The app removes and adds a tracking area on mouse entered and mouse exited events.\r\n2. Active the app window. Mouse in and out of the red view. Notice that mouseEntered: and mouseExited: events are received.\r\n2. Open a top most window, for example Apple -> About This Mac\r\n3. With the About This Mac window focused mouse in and out of the red view. Notice that mouseEntered: and mouseExited: events are no longer sent.\r\n4. Close the \"About This Mac\" window.\r\n5.
