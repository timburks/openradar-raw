    description: "Summary:The link to Java update 5 for Mac OS X 10.5, previously available at http://support.apple.com/downloads/DL924/en_US/JavaForMacOSX10.5Update5.dmg has since gone dead.  Software Update now offers a revised package(061-6809, available on the swscan cdn), but that is not available from the associated knowledge base article, nor support.apple.com/downloads    \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to download from previous URL, as listed above.\r\nAttempt to find update on support.apple.com, either in the knowledge base article or the downloads section\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAble to download the security patch\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n404 response from previous download URL, different numbering(061-6809 instead of 061-6808) and sha1 for the update with the same name \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSeems to have occurred towards the end of last year\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSysadmins who build images rely on security patches being available at a reliable location, instead of possibly hardware-specifc URL's they are pointed to by swscan. The QA that goes into the packages listed at software.apple.com/downloads reassures Admins that Apple is taking security and the associated patch management/image building seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE, April 19th: Fixed, correct URL is:\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/downloads/DL924/en_US/JavaForMacOSX10.5Update5.dmg"
