    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen AirPlay is activated in iPod or third-party apps, all local and push notifications sounds are not played. This happens even when the iPod or third-party app is not playing audio, but just connected via AirPlay.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Start iPod app\r\n2) Play audio through AirPlay\r\n3) Start an app that uses local notification (eg. Due)\r\n4) Schedule a 1 minute timer\r\n5) Go back to home screen\r\n6) Reminder alert shows in 1 minute time, but no sound is played through _either_ iPhone's speakers nor AirPlay speakers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlert sounds continue to get played through the phone speaker _and/or_ AirPlay speakers even when AirPlay is activated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlert sounds do not get played at all, whether through iPhone speakers or AirPlay speakers.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis behaviour means that third-party apps that rely on local notifications to alert users will fail to do so."
