    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Swedish translation of Terminal does not contain a translation for the key \"arrow right\" which makes it impossible to add keyboard mappings using this key without temporarily switching to another language.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose Swedish as your language\r\n2. Start Terminal\r\n3. Open Preferences -> Settings -> Keyboard\r\n4. Click + to add a new Key Setting\r\n5. Pull down the first drop down menu (Key)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe key \"cursor right\" should be present as \"markör höger\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll keys exists like in the english translation _except_ cursor right which is not present.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been the case in several releases of the Terminal application but this is the first time I report it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see attached screenshot where it becomes very obvious that the Swedish translation is missing one key."
