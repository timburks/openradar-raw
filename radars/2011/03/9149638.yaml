    description: "Summary: The new Jump Bar does not show method names\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open the documentation page (for example, UIWindow).\r\n2) Try to find a popup menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere would be a menu that lists all of the class' methods.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere's no menu.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nLet's say we're looking for some background on what happens when a new -rootViewController instance is assigned. After opening the documentation page for the UIWindow class, there aren't any controls to show the methods.\r\n\r\nBesides being a pain in the butt, this is wholly inconsistent with the behavior in the code editor which shows a list of functions, properties and methods after the class name.\r\n\r\n(Note that typing \"ro\" is enough to select \"rootViewController\" in the code editor's popup menu. That, followed by the enter key gets you to the code of interest.)\r\n\r\nFrom a developer's point-of-view, the header files and the documentation page go hand-in-hand. Make the UI affordances the same and we don't have to think about whether we're looking at code or the words that describe it.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to get to the rootViewController documentation with the Jump Bar. Unfortunately, it takes a lot more effort than in the code editor: you have to click on the class name, and then move the mouse until the subcategories appear. Choose \"Instance Methods\" and wonder why rootViewController isn't there. Then move the mouse back and try Properties.\r\n\r\nAnd forget about navigating these lists quickly and easily with the keyboard as you can with the code editor.\r\n\r\nMore information (including screenshots) at: http://furbo.org/?p=334"
