    description: "Summary:\r\nDebugging p2p applications is hard. Imagine the following situation:\r\n1. You have two iOS devices.\r\n2. You run one copy of the app under the debugger in Xcode.\r\n3. You run another copy of the app directly on the device with no debugger attached (as it is already occupied by debugging the first instance).\r\n4. Somewhere during the debug session, the second copy, which is running with no debugger attached, crashes.\r\n5. The only thing that helps you find out what went wrong with that copy is the crash log.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be really good if there was a way to run the app on more than one device simultaneously straight from Xcode and be able to debug them in parallel.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCurrently, it may be worked around by having two Macs, each running its own instance of Xcode with the app. But the overall usability of such solution is low: you have to sync the code, you have to switch mous and keyboard constantly, you have to actually support two development environments and pretend like they are a single instance. It could have been easier than that."
