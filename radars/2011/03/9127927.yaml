    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I create a Settings.bundle by dragging the \"Settings Bundle\" from the File Template Library to a newly created project in Xcode 4, the files generated on the file system are as expected, but I can't access the localized Root.strings file at all. Also I cannot create an additional localization for Root.strings\r\n\r\nOriginal post: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/91040?tstart=0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new project of type iOS Application - window-based\r\n* Navigate to the File template library\r\n* Drag a \"Settings Bundle\" to the group which contains the AppDelegate class and save it as \"Settings\"\r\n* In the project navigator, open the Settings.bundle\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that Xcode recognizes that the file \"Root.strings\" is a localized strings file which I can access and also add another localization.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the filesystem, the created files & directories are as expected:\r\n\r\nSettings.bundle/\r\n./en.lproj/\r\n./en.lproj/Root.strings\r\n./Root.plist\r\n\r\nIn the project navigator of Xcode though, the directory en.lproj is show as a (blue) directory and that's it. I can't access the \"Root.strings\" file at all. See uploaded file \"Settings.bundle.png\".\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nIf I manually change the file type of the directory en.lproj from \"Default - Directory\" to \"Directory\", I can access the Root.strings file. But as soon as I re-open Xcode, I can't access it again.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, that Xcode doesn't realize that Root.strings is really a localized file.. there's also no way to create an additional localization... I can do it manually on the filesystem, but... wish that would work in Xcode. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI tried it both with a local Git repository and without, with the same problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo further notes."
