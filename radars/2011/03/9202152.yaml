    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe use InstaDMG to create a pristine, unbooted image that can be deployed.  When an image is created that has never before been booted, the /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby directory symlink is incorrect - it attempts to symlink up 10 levels and then point to the Library/Ruby folder, when it SHOULD be 9 levels and then point to the Library/Ruby folder (e.g. ../../../../../../../../../Library/Ruby/).  When the machine is booted for the first time, this symlink is corrected.  The problem occurs when I try to use InstaDMG to install ruby libraries in the /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/ directory - because the symlink is incorrect, the ruby libraries aren't installed by InstaDMG and the dependencies are broken.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI use InstaDMG to create a pristine DMG of an un-booted 10.7 installation, but you can also use the Installer and inspect the system BEFORE it is booted for the first time.  Inspect the /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby symlink and you will see that it's incorrect\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nRunning \"ls -la /usr/lib/ruby should list the site_ruby directory with the following:\r\nlrwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel    47 Mar 29 08:49 site_ruby -> ../../../../../../../../../Library/Ruby/Site\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRunning \"ls -la /usr/lib/ruby ACTUALLY lists the site_ruby directory with the following:\r\nlrwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel    47 Mar 29 08:49 site_ruby -> ../../../../../../../../../../Library/Ruby/Site\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis ALSO occurs in 10.5 and 10.6 too."
