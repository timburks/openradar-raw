    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n• Back to My Mac is not available on iOS clients, even when a MobileMe account is correctly configured.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n• Back to My Mac should be available on iOS clients.\r\n\r\n• Bonjour services published on the BTTM registration domain (*.members.mac.com) should become available to applications on the iOS device while BTTM is on both on the Mac and that device. For example, the iPod application should show a shared library that's on a Mac running iTunes and Back to My Mac. As another example, a third-party SSH application should be able to connect to a Mac running Back to My Mac with Remote Login enabled."
