    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere is no way to set find options to find by symbol in XCode 4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to do a find in workspace and change the find options from Simple or Regular Expression to Symbol; it is not possible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should be able to do a search for symbol in the find pane.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI cannot choose to search for symbols.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nXCode 3.2 had this feature, it is no longer available in XCode 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe symbol navigator is nice, but it is not enough.  With the symbol navigator I can see where a symbol is defined but i cannot see where those symbols are used in the code.  I want to know where methods are called in my code so that it's easier to know when i can safely change them or remove them.  I used this feature very often in XCode 3 and not having it in XCode 4 is the only major thing in my eyes that makes XCode 4 not better than XCode 3."
