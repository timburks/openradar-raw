    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the iPhone is docked with a speaker attached, or docked to a third-party speaker dock, and that the speakers are switched off or at 0 volume, notifications sound do not play through iPhone's speakers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Dock the iPhone\r\n2) Hook up a speaker with the dock\r\n3) Turn off the speaker\r\n3) Start an app that uses local notification (eg. Due)\r\n4) Schedule a 1 minute timer\r\n5) Go back to home screen and wait for alert in 1 minute's time.\r\n6) Reminder alert shows in 1 minute time, but no sound is played through iPhone's speakers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification sound should continue to play through iPhone's speakers in the event that the docked speaker is turned off or has its volume turned down.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification sounds are not play at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlso affects all push notification alert sounds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Clock app fixes this by making its alert sounds always play through the iPhone's speakers, even when docked."
