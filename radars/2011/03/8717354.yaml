    description: "When my Dell 24\" LCD display (model: S2409W) is connected to the second display port on my 2010 MacPro (5,1) via the mini-display-port-toDVI dongle, my system seems to \"pulse\" every 4 seconds or so... The mouse becomes jerky and erratic, and I am almost unable to click the center of the screen as the pointer jerks past the center to the edge of the display.\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the plug, the system again responds normally.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought it might be the mighty mouse, but I've tried 2 mighty mice and both do the same thing -- the previous mouse was FINE with my 1,1 MacPro. I have also now purchased a USB mouse to investigate this problem and now find that it is also the same -- unusably jerky.\r\n\r\nReading Apple discussion forums indicates that this may be related to problems with HDCP support in MacOS?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am able to mitigate this problem slightly by disabling display sleep feature of screen saver so that the monitors did not power down; it seems to be something related to that."
