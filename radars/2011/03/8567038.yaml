    description: "When sending data to a kext via a socket in PF_SYSTEM domain from a user space, client stops to work about after 70000 or 80000 send() syscalls. Then the bug occurs and the send() syscall never returns back to userspace. \r\n\r\nAs our experiments show, it is irrelevant whether the ctl_send_func() callback is implemented or not (i.e. if NULL is used in the registration structure or not).\r\n\r\nFurther experiments revealed that after the bug occurs, the Kext cannot send data back to userspace with ctl_enqueuedata(). It then always fails with ENOBUFS. Other processes then were having problems as well, probably complete net stack is then out of order.\r\n\r\nReproduced on Mac OS X 10.4.11, 10.5.6, 10.6.4 (all of them Intel-based) and the bug is 100% reproducible."
