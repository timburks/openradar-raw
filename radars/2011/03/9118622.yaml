    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen iTunes is set to keep the music folder organized on an external hard drive, and you change the capitalization of an artist or album name, iTunes 10.2 (on Mac OS X 10.6.6) moves the files to a new folder structure at the root of the Mac's internal hard drive instead of where it should be on the external drive, and then indicates an error, that it doesn't know where the files are. This causes issues when attempting to clean up metadata on iTunes tracks, removing the files from the expected external hard drive structure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set iTunes > Preferences > Advanced > \"iTunes Media folder location\" to a folder on an external hard drive. Mine, for example, is set to /Volumes/Drobo/iTunes\r\n2. Set iTunes > Preferences > Advanced > \"Keep iTunes Media folder organized\" box to checked\r\n3. Select one or more music track(s) inside of iTunes to modify.\r\n4. Change just the case of one or more letters in either the Album or the Artist field. (For instance, change \"Live At The Sands\" to \"Live at the Sands\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\niTunes will rename the track as requested, and keep the folder structure organized on the external hard drive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes may or may not rename the track(s) (depending on how many tracks were selected), but will move the files to a new folder structure on the Startup hard drive which mirrors the folder structure in the correct external drive.\r\n\r\nFor instance, file(s) that were in:\r\n/Volumes/Drobo/iTunes/Music/Dean Martin/Live At The Sands/\r\nwould be moved to the startup drive at:\r\n/iTunes/Music/Dean Martin/Live at the Sands/\r\n\r\niTunes will then put a (!) marker next to the track, signifying that iTunes can no longer locate the track.\r\n\r\nIf you then manually move the files back into the folder structure where they should be on the external drive, iTunes will find them again, indicating that iTunes still expects the files to be on the external drive, even though it has moved them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn rare occasion, this may also cause iTunes to crash, but this is not consistently reproducible.\r\n\r\nThis does not occur when renaming Artist or Album in a way where iTunes can create a folder for the new edited name without issue. This also does not occur if you have \"Keep iTunes Media folder organized\" unchecked, as iTunes does not attempt to create any folders.\r\n\r\n(I should also note, I did turn off \"Keepâ€¦organized\" to test it, and when I turned that preference back on, it searched through my library and moved a significant number of files to the folder structure on the startup drive, which I expect is related to the above error.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI only noticed this issue starting with version 10.x of iTunes, but the last couple of week is the first time in a while that I have tried to clean up metadata in my iTunes library, so it could have been around longer. Unfortunately I do not have older version of iTunes on which to test this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect this is because I am changing the case, and the Mac OS X filesystem is not case sensitive. If when renaming, iTunes is attempting to create a new folder for Artist or Album which only differs in case from an existing folder, it would seem this triggers the bug and the resultant incorrect default to a folder structure on the startup disk."
