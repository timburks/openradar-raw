    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nShift option click can't be used to avoid popup help\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHold down shift and option while clicking on a symbol.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe documentation viewer should appear without popup help appearing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhen you hold down the option key and click on a symbol in Xcode, you see a popup window with a summary of the symbol that was clicked.\r\n\r\nFor novices, this window has some utilityâ€”it provides a simple way for them to dig into what is probably unfamiliar territory (\"What's a UIWindow anyway?\").\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this window becomes a roadblock for experienced developers. We know damn well what a UIWindow is: we need to dig into the details of this important class. Maybe we want to see know more about the rootViewController instance or look at some of the methods in UIResponder (because we know it inherits from that.) This helpful popup quickly becomes a hindrance.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Xcode, holding down the shift key along with the option key gave you a quick way to avoid this popup help. In Xcode 4, that shortcut is gone."
