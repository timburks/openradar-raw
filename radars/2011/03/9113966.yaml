    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the available space on the boot volume gets too low, Mac OS X automatically pauses apps. In this case, Safari. The Force Quit dialog offers to continue paused apps. However, clicking on this button does nothing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave Safari open with a lot of windows and tabs.\r\nFill your boot volume so that available space goes under 1 GB. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari gets paused. It should be possible to continue it after freeing some space on the boot volume.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking the Continue-Button does nothing.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot sure whether it's a localization issue. At least, the dialog is not properly laid out for German, the text at the top doesn't fit."
