    description: "22-Mar-2011 08:29 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nXcode 4 keeps adding an expired code signing certificate to my keychain. This causes duplicate entries which prevent Xcode from compiling because of the duplicate entry. Deleting the expired certificate is fruitless because Xcode restores it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached set of screenshots. [OpenRadar readers, screenshots are at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14191/bug-9173280-screenshots.zip]\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to do a device build in Xcode, it fails due to a code signing error. The error reads:\r\n\r\n\"CodeSign Error: Certificate identity 'iPhone Developer: Tom Harrington (VC7282VPMT)' appears more than once in the keychain. The codesign tool requires there be only one.\"\r\n\r\nThe above error is illustrated in screenshot \"image1-build.jpg\".\r\n\r\nIf I run Keychain access I can see that there are two entries marked as VC7282VPMT, one current and one expired (screenshot image2-keychain-access.jpg).\r\n\r\nI can delete the expired entry and it no longer appears (screenshot image3-keychain-access.jpg).\r\n\r\nIf I quit Xcode and restart it, the expired certificate reappears in Keychain access. If Keychain access is running, it's possible to watch this happen. This takes me from image3-keychain-access.jpg back to image2-keychain-access.jpg, with the expired certificate restored.\r\n\r\nIf I look in the Xcode organizer I can see duplicate entries (image4-organizer.jpg). But Xcode doesn't indicate which is current and which is expired. I thought maybe I could delete the certificates in the organizer window but they're not selectable.\r\n\r\nAt the iOS provisioning portal, only the current certificate is shown (image5-portal.jpg).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode would not restore duplicate, expired certificates to my keychain after I have deleted them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode effectively prevents itself from doing device builds by restoring bogus data.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNever had this problem before Xcode 4.\r\n\r\n29-Mar-2011 05:18 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nThis bug occurs with Xcode 4.0.1 (4A1006) exactly as described previously for Xcode 4.0."
