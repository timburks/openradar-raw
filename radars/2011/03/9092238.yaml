    description: "Summary: It appears to be impossible currently to use an NSFormatter to disallow certain keystrokes with an NSTokenField, due to the way both classes work.\r\n\r\nNSTokenField is a subclass of NSTextField, and it formats the contents of the text field in a private way, including the use of attachments to represent the tokens.\r\n\r\nNSFormatter, however, requires its subclassers to be able to provide the *exact* text field string contents of the text field it's attached to. Which I can't do, because I can't replicate the private format of the NSTokenField's text.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like is a subclass of NSFormatter that allows custom subclassers to *not* have to replicate the private innards of an NSTokenField's text, but still allows for custom formatting and validation of the untokenized text in such a field.\r\n\r\nSome links to other people who've had these problems:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4115407/prevent-newlines-to-be-typed-in-an-nstokenfield\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/Cocoa-dev/2008/Jul/msg00233.html"
