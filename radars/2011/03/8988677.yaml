    description: "11-Feb-2011 09:56 AM Rich Siegel:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nBBEdit replies on Xcode's scripting interface in order to implement certain features and behaviors; in particular, acceleration of \"Open File By Name\", as well as \"Open Counterpart\". In Xcode 4, the scripting interface has changed in some (unknown way) so that this integration no longer works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Open attached \"AskXcodeForFilePath.scpt\".\r\n\r\n1. Open a project in Xcode.\r\n\r\n2. Edit the file name in the script's \"on run\" handler, to match the name of source file in the project.\r\n\r\n3. Run the script.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe script should return a string (or list of strings) which is the full file system path to the source file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode got an error: Canâ€™t get every file reference of active project document whose name = \"CoreTerminology.h\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis worked correctly in Xcode 3.x.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWe have several scripts that rely on the Xcode 3 scripting object model. Because these scripts are embedded into BBEdit's application package, changing them in the field is extremely difficult (and impossible to do retroactively for customers with older versions of BBEdit).\r\n\r\nThe recommended best practice is to maintain compatibility with existing scripts whenever possible; if you need to know what kind of pain ensues when you break customers' scripts, I will be happy to enlighten you based on our own hard-won experience. :-)"
