    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen typing (at speed) on the iPad keyboard I sometimes miss a top-row key and the touch event is sent to the underlying content view. When this is something like a text view, such as when editing a document or text, the cursor is repositioned in the document. As a result the keystrokes that follow are entered into the document in the wrong place. Once the user notices, they have to do a four-step process of deleting the misplaced keystrokes, repositioning the cursor and re-entering the missed keystroke and the misplaced ones the follow. This disruption hampers the use of the iPads keyboard for text editing. \r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n\r\nAdd a ~24px blank strip of keyboard between the top of the iPad's on-screen keyboard and the underlying content view. This content buffer would be dead space whereby a missed keystroke on a top-row key wouldnt result in a touch going to the underlying content view. \r\n\r\nSee attached screenshots for a mockup."
