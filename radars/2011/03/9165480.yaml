    description: "*** Summary:\r\nNew MobileMe calendar does not accept events with email alarms created by the Calendar Store Framework.\r\n\r\n*** Steps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen iCal and create a new calendar called \"test\" under a MobileMe account.\r\nKeep iCal launched.\r\nOpen the attached \"MobileMeCalCalendar\" XCode project.\r\nBuild and run \"MobileMeCalCalendar.app\"\r\n\r\n*** Expected Results:\r\nNew all day event in your MobileMe calendar with an email alarm.\r\n\r\n*** Actual Results:\r\niCal returns the following error alert:\r\n    The server responded with an error.\r\n    Access to “Event with email alarm.” in “test” in account “<MOBILEMEACCOUNT>@me.com” is not permitted.\r\n    The server responded:\r\n    “HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden”\r\n    to operation CalDAVWriteEntityQueueableOperation.\r\n\r\nWith options \"Go Offline\" or \"Revert to Server\"\r\n\r\n*** Regression:\r\nThis always happens when using the Calendar Store Framework to make events with email alarms on MobileMe.\r\nSimilar events with message or message/sound alarms add as expected.\r\nAdding events using iCal's UI allows events with email alarms.\r\n\r\n*** Notes:\r\nIssues with this error are very common on the internet:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=CalDAVWriteEntityQueueableOperation+403\r\n\r\nThe warning itself is quite opaque… is there any documentation?"
