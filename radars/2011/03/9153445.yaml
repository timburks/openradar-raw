    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPlease allow Xcode 4 users a preference setting to choose if Xcode 4 should automatically clear log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Build and run an Xcode project and observe the log content is populated with text emitted by debugger.\r\n2) Stop the Xcode project, and Build and Run the same Xcode project again. Notice the previous log content has been deleted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode 4 users should be allowed the option to set Xcode 4 to NOT automatically clear log content. This is necessary for Xcode 4 users who want to compare log between runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode 4 clears log content at the beginning of each Run command issued by Xcode 4 users.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nXcode 4 no longer allows developer to choose if Xcode 4 should automatically clear log content (visible through 'Debug area' of Xcode 4). This is unlike \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAs a start, perhaps add a new 'IDEActivityLogAutoClear' key of type 'Boolean' in com.apple.dt.Xcode for Xcode 4 to recognize even if it takes time to add a NSButton control in Xcode 4 preferences.\r\n\r\nThanks."
