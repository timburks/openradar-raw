    description: "Summary:\r\nMail and Safari use NSPreferences, which is unofficially documented on CocoaDev:\r\n http://cocoadev.com/index.pl?NSPreferences\r\nCurrently, the developer appears not to have a standard way to implement a standard-looking Preferences dialog on OS X, except by using a toolbar and Core Animation directly.\r\n\r\nApart from complicating things needlessly for the developer, this also means the Preferences might no longer look standard in future releases on OS X. Exposing this in a documented way to developers means that more apps will have a consistent look now, as well as in future iterations of the operating system."
