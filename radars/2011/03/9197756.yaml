    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Xcode and iOS SDK update for 4.3.1 seemingly introduced an issue when using the compiler flag objc-nonfragile-abi2. Yes... this flag was been removed from Xcode 4 and Clang 2.0 before final release. It was still supported in the final release of Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS 4.3 however and is a useful bridge if one still needs to use Xcode 3. After updating to 4.3.1, simulator builds work fine but device builds will fail with the following message:\r\n \r\nerror: unknown argument: '-fobjc-nonfragile-abi2'\r\n\r\nThe very same project builds fine in Xcode 4.0.1 without that compiler flag and commenting *out* the flag in the xcconfig file makes device builds work but simulator builds fail with the usual errors about ivars may not be placed in class extension, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGrab this example and try to build for simulator and then device on Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS 4.3 SDK updated for 4.3.1\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/davidmorford/BuildKit\r\n\r\nDevForums Posting...\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/408704#408704"
