    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMac OS X Lion introduces the Launchpad as a primary method to launch apps. However, the system also provides other ways, such as the Dock itself or the Applications folder, that users might already be accustomed to and wish to keep using, without unnecessary items in the Dock. Therefore being able to detach the Launchpad icon from the Dock would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis would make Launchpad function like Dashboard pre-Lion, with a default Dock icon that can be removed, and an app in the Applications folder in order to still be able to open Launchpad and re-add it to the Dock."
