    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode should provide a way to identify images or resources that are not obviously being used in a project. There are at least two things I can think of to check for:\r\n\r\n1. Images/Resources that have been added to the project, but are not referenced in @ strings or in XIB files.\r\n\r\n2. Pointing to a directory of images/resources and identify which ones are not part of the project (i.e. they have not been added)\r\n\r\nI realize that these tools would never be perfect, as some resources would only be referenced via dynamic means. The object here would be to provide a candidate list of items that could be removed."
