    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen exporting an iOS application using the organizer share functionality, and then choosing \"Save for Enterprise Distribution\" has a bug when creating the manifest plist file.\r\n\r\nThe metadata bundle-version key defines the software version of the to be installed application. Therefor it relates to the CFBundleVersion key in the apps info.plist. (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009979)\r\n\r\nBut this key is completely ignored, and the bundle-version key and values are taken from CFBundleShortVersionString instead. If that value is missing, it simply does not write the bundle-version key to the manifest file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an iOS application\r\n- Only add a CFBundleVersion value to the info.plist\r\n- Choose Product menu and then Archive \r\n- Select the archived application in the organizer\r\n- Select the \"Share\" button\r\n- Choose \"iOS App Store Package (.ipa)\"\r\n- Select \"Next\"\r\n- Activate the checkbox \"Save for Enterprise Distribution\"\r\n- Fill out the Application URL field with any value, same for the title field\r\n- Select \"Save\"\r\n- Open the created manifest .plist file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe manifest .plist file should have the bundle-version key present wit the value of CFBundleVersion from the apps info.plist\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe key and the value is completely missing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf the applications info.plist instead contains the CFBundleShortVersionString key, its value will be written to the manifest plist.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
