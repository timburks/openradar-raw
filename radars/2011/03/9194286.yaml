    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen configuring pre-action or post-action scripts in Xcode to run as part of a build scheme, it is reasonable to expect that they should get passed the values of the various Xcode build variables in their environment.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing which project is being built, and where it is being built to, there is a very limited amount that such a script can do. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAdd a pre-action or post-action script with the following text:\r\n\r\n    set > environment.txt\r\n    open environment.txt\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe environment.txt file should be filled in with all environment variable values, and then should open in the default text editor.\r\n\r\nI would expect that the environment would include many xcode variables, such as BUILD_DIR, PROJECT_DIR and so on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nVery few Xcode specific variables are defined.  WORKSPACE_PATH and SCHEME_NAME are defined for pre-actions, but not post-actions."
