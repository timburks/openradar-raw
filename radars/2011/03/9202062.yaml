    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you put several preview windows in full screen mode the sidebar with the list of opened documents is shuffled. If the first fullscreen Space has a preview window with Doc1 and Doc2 opened and the next Preview fullscreen space has a window with Doc3 and Doc4 opened, the sidebar that lists the documents opened in this window will show Doc3 and Doc4 in the Doc1/Doc2 window and vice-versa. Clicking a different document in the currently visible space doesn't seem to do anything, but it actually switches the docs in the Space for this sidebar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a Preview window with several documents. Put it to fullscreen. Open another Preview window with several windows. Put it to Fullscreen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach fullscreened Preview should have it's own sidebar with a list of opened documents\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sidebars are shuffled between Spaces\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
