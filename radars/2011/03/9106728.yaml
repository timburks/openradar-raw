    description: "Summary:\r\nSince fired assertions and other uncaught exception crashes often require looking at the console output in order to debug, it would be a great improvement if Mac OS X and iOS crash log files were to also include the last few lines logged to the console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWith a crash like this iOS one, it can be tricky to get a handle on what the problem is:\r\n\r\n    Exception Type:  EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)\r\nException Codes: 0x00000000, 0x00000000\r\nCrashed Thread:  0\r\n\r\nThread 0 Crashed:\r\n0   libSystem.B.dylib               0x33bd52d4 __kill + 8\r\n1   libSystem.B.dylib               0x33bd52c4 kill + 4\r\n2   libSystem.B.dylib               0x33bd52b6 raise + 10\r\n3   libSystem.B.dylib               0x33be9d72 abort + 50\r\n4   libstdc++.6.dylib               0x31bdba20 __gnu_cxx::__verbose_terminate_handler() + 376\r\n5   libobjc.A.dylib                 0x3347c594 _objc_terminate + 104\r\n6   libstdc++.6.dylib               0x31bd9df2 __cxxabiv1::__terminate(void (*)()) + 46\r\n7   libstdc++.6.dylib               0x31bd9e46 std::terminate() + 10\r\n8   libstdc++.6.dylib               0x31bd9f16 __cxa_throw + 78\r\n9   libobjc.A.dylib                 0x3347b4c4 objc_exception_throw + 64\r\n10  Foundation                      0x33639910 __NSThreadPerformPerform + 648\r\n11  CoreFoundation                  0x33a767d6 __CFRUNLOOP_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_A_SOURCE0_PERFORM_FUNCTION__ + 6\r\n12  CoreFoundation                  0x33a485b0 __CFRunLoopDoSources0 + 376\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nNot a problem if it's the developer producing this crash right in front of them, he or she can dig to find any errors logged at the time of the crash. But if this is a crash report from a user for example, it can be impossible to go back and find this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would excellent if the crash log also listed, following the stack dump, some number of lines recently written to the console. Or if that's infeasible to do in general, then maybe just recent lines logged by NSLog from the crashed process? I can image a small ring buffer in each process where NSLog would save the most recent lines logged as well as sending them to the console as normal."
