    description: "In Xcode 4, the Edit Scheme sheet can only be closed with a mouse click.\r\n\r\nI believe the apple design documents encourage developers to have sheets be closed by either 1. pressing ESC or 2. a key-stroke or both.\r\n\r\nRequiring that the sheet be closed with a mouse click interrupts the user's work.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that ESC will always close sheets - this is the case for other sheets in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open an Xcode 4 project that has at least one Scheme defined\r\n\r\n2. Use the Schemes drop-down menu to select a scheme (or Cmd + <) for the current scheme.\r\n\r\n3. Try closing the sheet without using the mouse.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTo be able to close the sheet with ESC or some other key stroke.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe window can only be closed with a mouse click."
