    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I want to run for instance, a shell script that I have stored in ${SRCROOT}/Scripts/ from a pre or post action, I have no way of determining the path to SRCROOT. Run Script *build phases* can use build settings/environment variables, e.g. the old unit test run script phase:\r\n\r\n# Run the unit tests in this test bundle.\r\n\"${SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_DIR}/Tools/RunUnitTests\"\r\n\r\nNo such variables are accessible from the pre and post actions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPre/Post action scripts should work exactly the same as Run Script build phases, with all variables available."
