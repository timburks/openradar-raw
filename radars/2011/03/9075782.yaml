    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nI tried to constrain a split view divider so it cannot be resized via user dragging (but could be resized programmatically). I implemented the following NSSplitViewDelegate methods to return the current position:\r\n\r\n-splitView:constrainMinCoordinate:ofSubviewAt:\r\n-splitView:constrainMaxCoordinate:ofSubviewAt:\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nThe NSSplitView still draws a one-sided arrow cursor and allows the user to click and drag, and although the divider doesn't move, resize events still get fired. I would expect that a resize cursor wouldn't even be displayed, but one is anyway.\r\n\r\nI've been informed that overriding the following NSSplitView methods should cause it to work correctly:\r\n\r\n-minPossiblePositionOfDividerAtIndex:\r\n-maxPossiblePositionOfDividerAtIndex:\r\n\r\nHowever, it should not be necessary to subclass NSSplitView to accomplish what the delegate should allow.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nFinding the current position of a divider at a given index is still more complex than it ought to be. See rdar://8250671 for details."
