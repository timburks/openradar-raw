    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWeb pages marked with <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"> do not show the speed enhancements from the Nitro JavaScript engine when launched from the home screen. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an HTML page that performs a JavaScript benchmark containing the <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"> tag, or use the attached sample code.\r\n\r\n2. Visit the benchmark page in Safari and note the results of the benchmark.\r\n\r\n3. Add the page to the iOS home screen.\r\n\r\n4. Launch the page from the home screen.\r\n\r\n5. Run the benchmark again and compare the results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe benchmark results should not differ in any significant way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe benchmark run in Safari is significantly faster than the benchmark run from the page launched from the home screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis may be related to the bug where UIWebView in 3rd party apps do not see the performance enhancements from Nitro. However, since there is no 3rd party native code in home-screen web apps, it's possible there may be a different (and more expedient) way to resolve this issue."
