    description: "Mail.app allows users to right-click on the table header in the Message Viewer and (un)check the columns that are displayed. I frequently try to do the same thing in Finder and am always annoyed when I can't. Instead, I have to select View > Show View Options (âŒ˜J) to toggle column visibility. While that approach is arguably faster when toggling visibility of multiple columns, it would be incredibly convenient to be able to do it right from the table header itself; that's already the easiest place to change the sorted order and column.\r\n\r\nFWIW, if this does get added, I personally recommend excluding the \"Sort By\" sub-menu that Mail has."
