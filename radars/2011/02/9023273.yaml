    description: "Summary:\r\nThe CoreWLAN public framework that is available on Mac OS X 10.6 is not available as a public API in iOS 4. It would be extremely useful to have this API in a mobile platform as this is very useful to build augmented reality apps that use the signal strength of Wi-Fi base stations for triangulation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a similar API (WiFiManager) is available on Android, as well as other mobile platforms, which makes a feature gap between iOS and other platforms. This issue should be addressed ASAP. Many clients of ours would like us to build apps that use the signal strength information."
