    description: "It would be useful for my app to have the ability to retrieve and set the workspace of a window. I know I can dig through the CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo() function, but it would be great to expose all of this information to the NSWindow class.\r\n\r\nI know it's a bit of a long shot, but being able to set the workspace of a window/application via NSWindow/NSApplication would be really useful to me too."
