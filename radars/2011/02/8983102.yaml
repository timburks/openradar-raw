    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niOS (Both iPad SDK and iPhone SDK) only have the CGPDF API to deal with PDF files. Mac OS provides the PDF Kit framework with a good object oriented API. Please bring the PDF Kit to iOS.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPDF viewing is only one feature of the Thomson Reuters BoardLink application, but the large majority of problems that we have in our application is caused by doing our own PDF rendering management using the CGPDF API.  We have to support display of PDFs from multiple sources and are constantly having to rework our PDF rendering because of problems with a specific document which displays another shortcoming.  We have a very small team and lose a lot of time working on PDF issues instead of bringing new functionality to our users.\r\n\r\nImprovements in PDF management we'd love to see:\r\n\r\n* Easy drop-in PDF views that efficiently render PDFs with any embedded font profiles.\r\n* Access to positioning info for glyphs\r\n* Rudimentary text searching or access to attributed strings we can search ourselves.\r\n* Text selection and extraction\r\n* Basic annotation support (highlighting, notes, etc)\r\n* Access to PDF outlines and bookmarks\r\n* Support for password protected PDFs\r\n\r\nAny or all of these improvements would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTravis Fischer"
