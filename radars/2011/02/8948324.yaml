    description: "Summary:\r\nMy newly created Xcode 4 DP6 iPad project rejects my 72x72 png file for an Icon. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- Launch Xcode 4 DP6.\r\n2- File/New…/New Project…\r\n3- Select iOS application, Tab Bar Application\r\n4- Name it ADPoc, select iPad for the Device Family, check Include Unit Tests\r\n5- Save (check Create git repository)\r\n\r\n6- In the Project window, select the project icon in the Project Navigator\r\n7- On the right, select the app target (named ADPoc \"here\")\r\n8- At the top, select the \"Summary\" tab\r\n9- Unwrap the \"iPad Deployment Info\" pane with its triangle.\r\n10- The third heading, \"App Icon\", shows an empty image well (labelled \"No image specified\").\r\n11- Drag and drop a 72x72 png image file on that well. For example, use the file provided (Icon-72.png).\r\n12- Watch the error alert: \"The file \"/Development/ADPoc/ADPoc/../Icon/Icon-72.png\" does not match the required size and/or file type for the application icon. It must be a .png image, 72 x 72 pixels in size.\"\r\n\r\n11bis- alternatively, right click on the well and \"Select File\" the image file to get the same alert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image well should get the icon and display it. What Xcode should do with it, I'm not sure. Probably add the file to the project if that's not already the case, and add an entry in the project info.plist file to point to that image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA bogus claim that the png file is invalid.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached: the project, including the png file."
