    description: "When the system is set to use a SOCKS proxy for a given connection, all traffic is routed in a way that ignores defs in /etc/hosts, and is not able to be monitored by applications such as Little Snitch. All traffic through this proxy is 'unregulated'. When a system proxy is set, applications can still connect without using it. \r\n\r\nExample: A SOCKS proxy set up to tunnel traffic over SSH. Any traffic that goes over SSH ignores /etc/hosts and is not manageable with Little Snitch. Applications that connect to networks ignoring this system setting still trigger Little Snitch, and respect /etc/hosts."
