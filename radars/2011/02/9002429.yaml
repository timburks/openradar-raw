    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nItems that are unchecked in your iTunes library remain visible (although slightly greyed-out) and playable on the Apple TV.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Uncheck some media in your iTunes library.\r\n2. Connect to your iTunes library from your Apple TV via Home Sharing.\r\n3. Go the place where you the items should (or shouldn't in this case) be.\r\n4. Note that the item you unchecked previously is still visable and playable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUnchecking an item in your iTunes Library should prevent it from being shared via home sharing or bonjour sharing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe items are still accessible.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis works as expected on the 1st generation Apple TVs.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
