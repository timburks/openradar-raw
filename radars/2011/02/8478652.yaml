    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen entering keystrokes while the contextual menu of the Finder is open, the \"Open with...\"-submenu displays duplicate items. After the usual list of recommended apps and the \"Other...\" menu item, the same (list of apps + \"Other...\") is repeated many times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select any file in the Finder.\r\n2. Open the Finder's contextual menu (e.g. via right-click or using the \"Action\"-toolbar item)\r\n3. Enter any keystrokes (as long as they don't cause the contextual menu to disappear).\r\n4. View the \"Open with…\" submenu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA list of apps which are able to open the selected file, where each app is displayed exactly one time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe list of apps is repeated several times.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAppears at least in Mac OS X 10.6.2 – 10.6.6\r\nDoes not appear in Mac OS X 10.4.11. Not tested in Mac OS X 10.5.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis only happens when keystrokes are registered *before* the \"Open with...\" submenu is displayed for the first time. When entering n keystrokes before opening the submenu, the list of apps is displayed n+1 times."
