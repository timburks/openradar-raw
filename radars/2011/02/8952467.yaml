    description: "Summary:\r\nCore Data supports transient attributes, but not transient entities. A transient entity would never be saved and would always be instantiated empty, but would otherwise behave as any normal NSManagedObject, including supporting fetches and predicates.\r\n\r\nThe advantage to having transient entities is that the Core Data model can encompass more of the application's model. I would put more into Core Data if this feature existed, instead of creating custom model classes that don't need persistence and then having to link them up to my Core Data model.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Core data project\r\nAdd a new entity\r\nAttempt to select transient entity property\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTransient entity property exists\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTransient entity property does not exist\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
