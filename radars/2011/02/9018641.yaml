    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe AssetLibrary Framework's methods for getting assets do not say what thread your passed in blocks run on or if they run concurrently or serially or if they get run before the method returns. This is pretty important information to know.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse any of the AssetLibrary Framework's asset getting methods (assetForURL or all the enumeration methods).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI will go through each method and describe how *I think* it works\r\n\r\n• ALAssetsLibrary's assetForURL:resultBlock:failureBlock: - Blocks do not get run before method returns\r\n• ALAssetsLibrary's enumerateGroupsWithTypes:usingBlock:failureBlock: - Blocks do not get run before method returns. I think the blocks are run serially. The blocks do not seem to always run on the same thread you called the method from.\r\n\r\n• ALAssetsGroup's enumerateAssetsAtIndexes:options:usingBlock: - Blocks seem to be run before the method returns. Blocks are run serially.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease document this stuff so we know what to expect! For example, if I run the method from the main thread can I assume my blocks are run on the main thread? Are the classes in the AssetLibrary thread safe? Can they be used in any thread? Inquiring minds want to know!"
