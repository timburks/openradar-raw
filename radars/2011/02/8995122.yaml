    description: "13-Feb-2011 02:05 PM David Brown:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAfter performing an import from a linux server's (not sure if that's important or not) network drive the next time I go to import no images show up in the import window any more, even when looking at the local disk.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1 - In Finder, browse to a network share with images in it offered through AFP by a linux server (again, not sure if it's important that it is a linux server) via the \"SHARED\" sidebar section.\r\n2 - In Aperture, import these images to a new project using the Import window and selecting the folder through the bottom of the Import window.\r\n3 - In Finder, browse around to more folders on the same network share.\r\n4 - In Aperture, attempt to import some new files in one of the directories browsed to.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nImages show up in the import window ready to import.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe import window displays no images.  This is true now for local folders, as well.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have a mix of NEF, JPG, MOV, and AVI files in these directories.  None of them show up.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure what I did to get it to where it would show me images again, but it eventually does.  I restarted Aperture and no images showed up, but then after messing around a bit they came back.  It seems that sometimes closing and reopening the Import window (by clicking on the Import icon twice) helps.  I'll add more information if I figure out how I'm getting them to reappear.\r\n\r\n13-Feb-2011 02:34 PM David Brown:\r\nThe missing step:\r\n\r\n2.5 - Remove the source folder that Aperture just imported from after the import is complete.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the step that causes the problem."
