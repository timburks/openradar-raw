    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSome images appears discolored when displayed within PDFs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a PDF that contains an image without an embedded color profile.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe image appears correctly colored.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe image is blue-tinted instead of displaying normally.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe same document displayed in 3.2 renders the image color correctly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis will happen with images that do not have an embedded color profile in it.  In the attachments is an image with a color profile, one without an embedded color profile, and a PDF containing both.  The image with the embedded profile (the car) will appear fine.  The image without a color profile (the people) will have a blue tint instead of the proper full color."
