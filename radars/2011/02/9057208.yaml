    description: "It would be good for apps to be able to register to be notified when the system is entering/exiting Mission Control or the dashboard, much like the active space notification. Here are a list of potential notifications I would find useful:\r\n\r\n * User activated mission control;\r\n * User exited mission control;\r\n * User activated dashboard;\r\n * User exited dashboard;\r\n * User moved application/window to a difference space.\r\n\r\nThanks for the consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Dec-2011 04:29 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThank you for filing this bug report.\r\n\r\nWe are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue and will continue to track it.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check the seed notes and release notes for any updates that might affect this issue.
