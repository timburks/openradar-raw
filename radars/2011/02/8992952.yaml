    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using Scripting Bridge on Xcode to try to do automated tests on my iOS device. Basically, I build a product, and tell it to install and launch (debug). The application runs a unit test and exits. I repeat this process for different tests.\r\n\r\nAccording to the header generator or Applescript dictionary, there is a property called activeSDK. Presumably, I need this if I want to control changing the activeSDK. When I try using this property, it doesn't seem to exist and stops my program dead in its tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a Scripting Bridge script written in Lua (using LuaCocoa). You will need to install LuaCocoa to run my script. (It is a simple drag-and-drop install of LuaCocoa.framework to /Library/Frameworks)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Open Xcode with a iOS project that is ready to go. (Hit build to make sure an executable can be launched and make sure you have an iOS device ready to be run on.)\r\n\r\nMake the script executable.\r\nRun ./ScriptingBridge_Xcode_activeSDK.lua\r\n\r\nYou'll see an exception/error when I call xcode_project:activeSDK().\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould see the name of the activeSDK printed to the terminal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe script aborts because the property doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLuaCocoa can be found here:\r\nhttp://playcontrol.net/opensource/LuaCocoa/\r\nThere is a binary package available."
