    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAutomatic lens distortion correction would be an extremely useful feature in Aperture.  As it is now, one must use external software which doesn't fully integrate into a RAW workflow.  I would love to see Aperture add lens distortion correction to its nondestructive RAW editing workflow.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this has been requested before, and I fully expect this to be closed as a duplicate, so please consider this my vote for this feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
