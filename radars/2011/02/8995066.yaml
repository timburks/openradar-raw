    description: The Remote Control of Multimedia page in the Event Handling Guide for iOS says to use the Now Playing Controls to test support for remote events. However, bringing up those controls makes the application inactive. According to the iOS Application Programming Guide, an inactive application is suppose to stop multimedia playback until.it becomes active again (i.e. stop while there is a phone call).
