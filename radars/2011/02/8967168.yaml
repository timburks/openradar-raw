    description: "07-Feb-2011 12:17 PM Kyle Sluder:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nEven though the system key binding dictionary maps Escape to -cancelOperation:, -[NSWindow doCommandBySelector:] seems to convert that into -complete:. This is troublesome for implementors who need to end editing on the Escape key rather than perform autocompletion.\r\n\r\nIdeally, Escape would never trigger autocompletion. But if the current behavior is desired (maybe it can remain exclusive to non-field-editors?), the Escape key should be bound to a new method declared on NSResponder, -completeOrCancelOperation:, the default implementation of which calls -complete:. Subclassers (or NSTextViews whose -isFieldEditor returns NO) can choose to implement it to cancel the operation instead.\r\n\r\nOption-Escape and F5 can remain as -complete:, and Cmd-. can remain as -cancelOperation:.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create and run an app with a text field.\r\n2. Set breakpoints on -[NSTextView complete:] and -[NSWindow cancelOperation:]\r\n3. Type some stuff in the text field.\r\n4. Press Escape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEnd of editing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe text field tries to autocomplete your entry.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis worked in Panther and Tiger, IIRC."
