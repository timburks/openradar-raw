    description: "The documentation for -[NSURLCache initWithMemoryCapacity:diskCapacity:diskPath:] states the following for the \"path\" parameter:\r\n\r\n\"In iOS, path is the name of a subdirectory of the applicationâ€™s default cache directory in which to store the on-disk cache (the subdirectory is created if it does not exist).\"\r\n\r\nThis note is irrelevant and misleading to developers because on-disk caching is not currently possible on iOS, since NSURLCacheStorageAllowed is treated like NSURLCacheStorageAllowedInMemoryOnly. This should be clarified in the documentation for NSURLCache.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you wanted to enable on-disk caching through NSURLCache on iOS instead of fixing the documentation, I'm sure people would be even happier. :)"
