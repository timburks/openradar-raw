    description: "Summary:\r\nThe class reference for UISegmentedControl contains incorrect information. According to the information in the documentation, you can not add a segment to the end of control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Class Reference for UISegmentedControl.\r\n2. Click insertSegmentWithImage:atIndex:animated: or insertSegmentWithTitle:atIndex:animated:.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote the \"minus 1\" in the documentation for insertSegmentWithImage:atIndex:animated: and insertSegmentWithTitle:atIndex:animated:\r\n\r\n\"An index number identifying a segment in the control. It must be a number between 0 and the number of segments (numberOfSegments) minus 1; values exceeding this upper range are pinned to it. The new segment is inserted just before the designated one.\"\r\n\r\nAssume 2 segments. This means numberOfSegments is 2. numberOfSegments-1 is 1. The statement in the documentation thus says index must be between 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nIf you insert at 0, you get a new segment on the left. If you insert at 1, you get a new segment between the two existing segments. According to the documentation, then, you can not insert at 2. Thus, you can not insert a segment on the right.\r\n\r\nThe statement in the documentation should not include the \"minus one.\" The iOS code is correct."
