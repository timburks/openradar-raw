Wait three seconds for controls to disappear.  Allow the device to auto-lock.  Wake it up/unlock it and play another video in the same session of the same app.  Wait for as long as you like - the controls will not disappear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nControls should be dismissed automatically after three seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nControls are never dismissed for the remaining uptime of the app.  restarting the app restores the expected behavior."
