    description: "Summary:\r\niPhoto should support background operations.\r\nUploading a medium-sized batch of photos (172) to Flickr runs overnight. Uploading a photo book likewise takes hours. Exports and other options should not block the iPhoto UI or each other.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOrder a book or upload a batch of photos (I use BetterHTMLExport & FlickrExport).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhoto should allow me to use it while ordering/exporting, and to run multiple exports simultaneously.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhile ordering or exporting, iPhoto is unusable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is as true for iMovie, where I end up doing all my editing, and then doing all my exporting..."
