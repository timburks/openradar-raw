    description: "The iOS SDK appears to contain ICU, but does not make all of its header files available.  As per Apple policy, this means that our products should not make use of ICU as its APIs are (mostly) classified as private.\r\n\r\nPlease include the full set of the ICU header files in a future version of the iOS sdk.  Specifically, we would currently like access to the following...\r\n\r\nClasses: \r\n  Collator\r\n  UChar\r\n  UnicodeString\r\n  UConverter\r\n  UErrorCode\r\n  Locale\r\n\r\nHeaders:\r\n   unicode/coll.h\r\n   unicode/unistr.h\r\n   unicode/ucnv.h\r\n   unicode/ustream.h (debugging only)\r\n\r\nGlobal functions:\r\n  ucnv_open\r\n  ucnv_close\r\n  ucnv_fromUChars\r\n  u_tolower\r\n  u_toupper\r\n  u_isalpha"
