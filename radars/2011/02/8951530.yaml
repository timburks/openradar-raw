    description: "03-Feb-2011 01:32 AM Jean-Denis Muys:\r\nSummary:\r\nInvisible files in a project that *are* under revision control are not displayed by the project navigator. This leads to situations where the project cannot be pushed (because some invisible file needs to be committed first), but the Commit command is disabled (because the project navigator thinks its has nothing to commit).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0- Create a new project. Set up a remote git repository for that project.\r\n1- Add to the project a directory of existing files that happens to contain a .DS_Store file (not visible). Note that the .DS_Store file is not displayed in the project navigator.\r\n2- File/Source Control/Commitâ€¦ The .DS_Store file, is now visible in the file list as newly added file! It shouldn't.\r\n3- Deselect the .DS_Store from being committed. Commit everything else.\r\n4- Try to Push. I get an error message: \"The working copy \"ADPoc\" has uncommitted changes. Commit or discard the changes and try again.\". Yet no file in the project shows as modified. It seems \".DS_Store\" might be the problem.\r\n5- Try to commit, as instructed in the previous step: the Commit command is disabled in the menu, as the project shows no file to commit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 4: I expected to be able to Push, since the Project Navigator did show anything to commit.\r\nIn step 5: I expected to be able to commit since Xcode told me so in step 4. Also simply because the .DS_Store file was still left to be committed. I expected the invisible file to be displayed in the project navigator, since it was staged.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIn step 2: .DS_Store file was put under revision control.\r\nIn step 4: I got an error when trying to push.\r\nIn step 5: The commit command was disabled, though Xcode told me to commit in step 4, and though the .DS_Store file was still left to be committed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee rdar://8951416 which is a related, but different, issue.\r\n\r\nIn step 2, Xcode put a .DS_Store file under revision control. The same issue would likely occur with a more \"legitimate\" invisible file. Typically, a .gitignore file could be thus in the project, preventing the project from being pushed (after a modification for example), but with no way to commit it since the project navigator would ignore it as an invisible file.\r\n\r\nI believe that any invisible file that is not ignored should be displayed by the project navigator."
