    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nChanging the magnificationFilter of a CALAyer to kCAFilterTrilinear _while_ it already has its contents set results in the following message being logged: “CoreAnimation: rendering error 500”\r\n\r\nBesides the message, it also doesn't work. In our app I have also tried to use a new layer with the kCAFilterTrilinear set, but this results in the same message. Probably because the actual contents are being cached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create CALayer with contents and set its magnificationFilter to kCAFilterNearest.\r\n2. Once the layer has been displayed switch the magnificationFilter to kCAFilterTrilinear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAn upscaled image to change from being displayed pixelated to smooth.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing changes and the aforementioned ambiguous error message is logged.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis does *not* occur when switching to kCAFilterLinear instead of kCAFilterTrilinear, so I'm using that as a workaround.\r\n\r\nSee the attached sample app for an example of the problem: http://cl.ly/2F2m3B3h3W3m2F3M350e"
