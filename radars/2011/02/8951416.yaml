    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 4 DP6 will not instruct git to ignore from revision controls system invisible files such as . DS_Store\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0- Create a new project. Set up a remote git repository for that project.\r\n1- Add to the project a directory of existing files that happens to contain a .DS_Store file (not visible). Note that the .DS_Store file is not displayed in the project navigator.\r\n2- File/Source Control/Commitâ€¦ The .DS_Store file, is now visible in the file list as newly added file! It shouldn't.\r\n3- Deselect the .DS_Store from being committed. Commit everything else.\r\n4- Try to Push. I get an error message: \"The working copy \"ADPoc\" has uncommitted changes. Commit or discard the changes and try again.\". Yet no file in the project shows as modified. It seems \".DS_Store\" might be the problem.\r\n5- Try to commit, as instructed in the previous step: the Commit command is disabled in the menu, as the project shows no file to commit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 2: I expected  the .DS_Store *not* to be put under revision.\r\nIn step 4: I expected to be able to Push, since the Project Navigator did show anything to commit.\r\nIn step 5: I expected to be able to commit since Xcode told me so in step 4. Also simply because the .DS_Store file was still left to be committed.\r\n\r\nOverall: I expected Xcode to put into a .gitignore file all the files that are not related to the project. That includes system invisible files such as .DS_Store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn step 2: .DS_Store file was put under revision control.\r\nIn step 4: I got an error when trying to push.\r\nIn step 5: The commit command was disabled, though Xcode told me to commit in step 4, and though the .DS_Store file was still left to be committed."
