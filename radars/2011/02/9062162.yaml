    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari, if there are multiple certificate prompts for a single certificate, earlier actions are ignored if they are not repeated for the last such prompt.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Safari.\r\nOpen 2 tabs to the same site with an untrusted certificate.\r\nQuit Safari.\r\nRelaunch Safari.\r\nReopen All Windows from Last Session.\r\nIn the top dialog, click Show Details and the checkbox to permanently trust this certificate. Accept.\r\nIn the second dialog, click OK to proceed without repeating the permanent trust action (which should already have taken effect).\r\nQuit Safari.\r\nRelaunch Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari should trust the site and not present any certificate dialogs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari does not trust the site, and presents both certificate dialogs again.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nSpecify permanent trust on the *last*/bottom dialog for the site, which is effective."
