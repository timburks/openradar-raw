    description: "NSOperation is designed to be used synchronously. This makes it difficult to use with asynchronous code, such as HTTP network code, and generally means that the NSOperation has to contain special code to be made synchronous. However, there are many instances where the job queueing semantics of NSOperationQueue are desirable in an asynchronous environment. It becomes very trivial to do things like network queueing with little extra code.\r\n\r\nA solution could be to add two APIs to NSOperation:\r\n\r\n-(BOOL)isAsynchronous; // returns NO by default\r\n-(void)finish;\r\n\r\nIf [myOperation isAsynchronous] returns YES, when the -[NSOperation main] call finished, the operation would not complete, and would instead wait for -[NSOperation finish] to be called. This would allow asynchronous APIs to have callbacks which signal that the NSOperation has finally completed."
