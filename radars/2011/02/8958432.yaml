    description: "Summary:\r\nDisk Utility.app offers the possibility to reset permissions to their original state (as specified in the .pkg-bundles in /Library/Receipts/ and ~/Library/Receipts/.) The button for this is labeled \"Repair Disk Permissions\".\r\n\r\nThis frequently leads to misunderstandings, as unexperienced users consider any changed permissions as a sign of severe software problems. While this is possible, there are usually several other harmless reasons for changed permissions.\r\n\r\nTo avoid unnecessary troubles for unexperienced users, I suggest relabeling the button to read \"Reset Disk Permissions\" instead.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne example for the confusion caused by the label of this button can be found on the german site Apfeltalk here: http://www.apfeltalk.de/forum/neuer-imac-zugriffsrechte-t350979.html"
