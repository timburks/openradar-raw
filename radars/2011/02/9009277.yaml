    description: "15-Feb-2011 11:57 PM David Brown:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen choosing photos to sync to my iPhone 4 (or my 3GS; same results), iTunes only shows a subset of the photos available.  For example, if I select a project that has 23 photos and videos to sync, iTunes only shows 20 available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Import photos into an Aperture project in a managed library (not sure if the managed library part is important).\r\n2. Open iTunes and sync.  (At this point my recollection is that everything synced as I expected.)\r\n2. Relocate masters to make them referenced (again, not sure if this was part of the problem or not).\r\n3. Open iTunes again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPhotos synced the first time should stay on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPhotos were removed from the iPhone because iTunes no longer saw all of them.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI did start a new library recently which was managed and then relocated the masters to be referenced, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it.  It does seem like that's when the problem started.\r\n\r\nI've tried regenerating the previews (seemed to pick up more but not all), regenerating thumbnails, repairing disk permissions, and closing and opening both Aperture and iTunes.\r\n\r\nI logged this against \"iApps\" for iTunes, but it very well could be an Aperture problem.\r\n\r\nI have tried creating a new project and then moving photos into it but the new project also has the same problem in iTunes."
