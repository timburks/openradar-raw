    description: "Summary:\r\nThe issue that I am coming across is that AVAssetReader uses a large amount of memory as soon as startReading is called and it is never freed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- load sample project attached to bug\r\n- click 'Build and Debug' in Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMemory usage should increase while reading the video file using the AVAssetReader, then return to their previous levels when it is done and released.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMemory spikes as soon as startReading is called and it is never returned.  The app quite quickly gets shutdown by the watchdog for excessive memory usage.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEven simply doing the following results in a huge memory spike that can't be freed:\r\n\r\n[myAssetReader startReading];\r\n[myAssetReader cancelReading];\r\n[myAssetReader release];\r\n\r\nThe sample project attached includes 2 video files that both exhibit the same memory spike.  One is directly from the iPhone camera while the other is a smaller, longer video. The processing will begin in viewDidLoad so just launching it with Instruments open is all you need to do to reproduce."
