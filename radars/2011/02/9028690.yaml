    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari, the Bookmarks Bar keyboard shortcuts (on Azerty keybaords without a numeric keypad, such as MacBooks or Apple Wireless keyboards) do not work until you select the Bookmarks > Bookmarks Bar menu. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1/ Launch Safari.app (let's say you have at leat 1 bookmark in your Bookmarks Bar)\r\n2/ Hit ⌘1 (on a European Azerty keyboard : ⌘ ⇧ & where & is the key just under the F1 key)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari should open the page that has been bookmarked as the first bookmark in the Bookmarks Bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt occurs in Safari Version 5.0.3 (6533.19.4)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround I found is :\r\n1/ Click the Bookmarks menu in the Menu Bar and select Bookmarks Bar (the bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar are displayed along with their keyboard shortcuts : ⌘1, ⌘2, ⌘3, …)\r\n2/ Click on the Safari window to get the focus and close the Bookmarks Bar menu\r\n3/ Hit ⌘1 : it works as expected, the page bookmarked as the first bookmark in the Bookmarks Bar is now opened"
