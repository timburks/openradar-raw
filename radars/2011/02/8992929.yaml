    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using Scripting Bridge on Xcode to try to do automated tests on my iOS device. Basically, I build a product, and tell it to install and launch. The application runs a unit test and exits. I repeat this process for different tests.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that launch() seems to fail to actually launch. In contrast, debug() actually works, but I was hoping that launch() would work and might be a bit faster since I don't need the debugger and I need to launch a lot of tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a Scripting Bridge script written in Lua (using LuaCocoa). You will need to install LuaCocoa to run my script. (It is a simple drag-and-drop install of LuaCocoa.framework to /Library/Frameworks)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Open Xcode with a iOS project that is ready to go. (Hit build to make sure an executable can be launched and make sure you have an iOS device ready to be run on.)\r\n\r\nMake the script executable.\r\nRun ./ScriptingBridge_Xcode_basic.lua\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to launch the executable from the active Xcode project onto your device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application will launch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application does not launch.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLuaCocoa can be found here:\r\nhttp://playcontrol.net/opensource/LuaCocoa/\r\nThere is a binary package available."
