    description: "There is no clean way to third parties to vertically center text in a cell. Finder vertically centers text when in list view and the icon size is set to 32px, and more than one external developer has been confused by why this is so difficult to accomplish.\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1235219\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1759054\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5052270\r\n\r\nI've run into the same problem. It seems rather strange that this is so difficult to do. Ideally, this should be a checkbox in IB, not something that requires subclassing or a category to accomplish."
