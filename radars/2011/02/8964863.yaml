    description: "06-Feb-2011 10:34 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nSummary:\r\nBoundaries of favorite/rejected segments, boundaries of selected clips, and current playhead are all distinct but related, and iMovie does not separate *or* connect them enough. For example:\r\n1. It is not possible to move the playhead in the Events area without disrupting the current selection (first).\r\n2. It is not possible to precisely align the playhead or selection with a Favorite boundary.\r\n3. It is not possible to select a range without losing the current playhead position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a section of an Event.\r\nStart playback.\r\nAttempt to move the playback point without affecting the selection.\r\n\r\n2 ,Make a clip a favorite.\r\nChange the selection.\r\nAttempt to reselect the favorite segment exactly.\r\n\r\n3. Start playback.\r\nSelect a different segment."
