    description: When configuring a table column in a nib, there is a "Title" field where you can set the text that appears in the header for the column. However, NSTableColumn doesn't have a -title method as you might expect; you have to call [[tableColumn headerCell] title] instead. It's easy once you know the trick, but it's not very discoverable for those who don't. It took some guesswork and trial by error for me to figure it out.
