    description: "Summary:\r\nThe /Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS/ uses \"plural verb\" to mean \"verb ending in s.\" This is thoroughly confusing, as singular verbs end in \"s\", not plural verbs. Specifically, it states that hints should begin with a \"plural verb\" as in \"Plays the song\" as opposed to using an imperative verb - which it incorrectly distinguishes as a \"singular verb\" - as in \"Play the song.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows up in its \"Guidelines for Creating Hints\" subsection of the \"Making Your iPhone Application Accessible\" chapter (direct link: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Making_Application_Accessible/Making_Application_Accessible.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008785-CH102-SW11).\r\n\r\nThe text in question:\r\n\r\n> **Begins with a plural verb.** As you create a hint, imagine that you’re describing the use of a control to a friend. You might say something like “Tapping this control plays the song.” Often, you can use the second phrase in such a sentence (in this case, “Plays the song”) as a hint.\r\n> \r\n> Avoid beginning the phrase with a singular verb, because this can make the hint sound like a command. In other words, you don’t want to tell users to “Play the song”; instead, you want to tell users that tapping the element “Plays the song.”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Making_Application_Accessible/Making_Application_Accessible.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008785-CH102-SW11.\r\n2. Read the text quoted above.\r\n3. Be very confused by the abuse of \"singular\" and \"plural\" verb to refer to the distinction between a singular present imperative form of a verb (the so-called \"singular verb\" because it does not end in \"s\") versus a third-person singular present declarative form of a verb (the so-called \"plural verb\" because it does end in \"s').  This reverses the standard use of singular verb (ends in \"s\") and plural verb (does not end in \"s\") and ignores the distinction in mood (imperative versus declarative).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text uses standard English grammatical terminology.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text uses inaccurate English grammatical terminology (ignoring the mood distinction) and reverses the use of singular and plural verb. This appears to be due to the author confusing how verbs are conjugated to agree with a plural subject versus how nouns are pluralized (in most cases, just add an \"s\"). This is readily demonstrated by these two example sentences:\r\n\r\n* \"The computer runs.\" Singular subject \"computer\" (no final \"s\"), singular verb \"runs\" (final \"s\")\r\n* \"The computers run.\" Plural subject \"computers\" (marked by the final \"s\"), plural verb \"run\" (no final \"s\").\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis made me take a triple-take the first time I read it. Also, wouldn't just \"Use third-person singular forms omitting the subject, like 'Plays the song,' rather than an imperative, like 'Play the song,'\" be a heck of a lot more direct?\r\n\r\n24-Aug-2011 01:38 PM Steven Andriella :\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed through updates to documentation:\r\n\r\n http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/index.html \r\n\r\nPlease check and let us know if you still see any issues.\r\n\r\n24-Aug-2011 01:54 PM Jeremy Sherman:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
