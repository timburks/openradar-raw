    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation on +[UIView transitionFromView:toView:duration:options:completion:] indicates that  \"By default, the view in fromView is replaced in the view hierarchy by the view in toView.\" However, instead of taking the place of fromView, the new view is instead added as the frontmost subview.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place a button in front of a view.\r\n2. Use +[UIView transitionFromView:toView:duration:options:completion:] to replace the view behind the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button is still visible after the transition animation, since the new view should have simply replaced the old view in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button is hidden behind the new view.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been the behavior since iOS 4.0, when the method was introduced.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne workaround for this issue is to use +[UIView transitionWithView:duration:options:animations:completion:] and manually place the new view in the correct place in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project which demonstrates the issue."
