    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen you have multiple seasons of a particular TV show, the seasons are all listed individually in the main TV Shows list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Get or create three TV shows where they all have the same show name, but have different season metadata.\r\n2. Connect to your iTunes library via home sharing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe TV show should be listed by name in the TV Shows list, then when you select the show, it should show all the seasons.\r\n\r\nThere should be one entry in the main TV Shows section for the name of the show, and then the seasons should be displayed when you choose that show.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe seasons are all listed on the main TV shows list. This makes the list extremely long and hard to navigate when you have a TV show with many seasons.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis doesn't occur on the the 1st generation Apple TV.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
