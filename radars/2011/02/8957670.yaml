It keeps replacing the text with 'Bi’r Yūnus' and the only way I've found to clear the search is to force quit the app from the multitasking bar.\r\n\r\nSome context:\r\n\r\nI was searching for this because we had been discussing the jackass episode where Johnny Knoxville visits the town of mianus : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mianus_(neighborhood)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch Google Maps\r\n2. Tap the search control and type 'myanus'\r\n3. Click Search\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSearch is corrected to 'Bi’r Yūnus' or 'Mianus'.  If I tap the X or backspace I should be able to remove the search text and start again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSearch is corrected to 'Bi’r Yūnus'.  However if I try and tap the X or backspace the text keeps being replaced with 'Bi’r Yūnus'\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWe all tried this at the pub after cocoaheads Sydney and saw it happening on iOS 4.3 beta 2,3 and iOS 4.2.1.  This happens on both the iPad and iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe only other version I have available to test is iOS 3.1.3 and in that case it works as expected (corrects to Bi’r Yūnus still but I can delete it).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ideal result would be for it to correct to 'mianus' as this is the closest misspelling.  But at the very least it should let me replace the autocorrection :)\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: this is fixed in iOS 5"
