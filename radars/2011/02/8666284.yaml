    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAperture 3.1 (with Digital Camera RAW 3.1.4 - Build 5460000.1) exports versions of images with missing metadata.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Import a NEF image into aperture which has the \"Lens\" EXIF metadata\r\n- Export a jpg version\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe exported jpg should retain the \"Lens\" EXIF metadata.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe exported jpg does not have \"Lens\" EXIF metadata (which can be easily verified with exiftool).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has occurred since I first started using Aperture 3.0.  I've read reports that it happened in Aperture 2, as well.  This is the main bug that's keeping me from using Aperture exclusively and moving over from Lightroom.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSample image attached.  There are other fields that are missing on export, but the lens information is what's hurting my workflow the most right now.  Without lens information some external tools cannot work automatically (such as Photoshop's automatic lens correction).\r\n\r\nI suppose this could be considered a feature request, but one could argue that it is a form of data loss as most would expect this data to be in tact when exporting."
