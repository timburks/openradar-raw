    description: "With the pending release of Xcode 4.0 I was hoping that since git was getting added to the SCM list, that mercurial would also get a look in but unfortunately it didn't. So I'm requesting that Xcode gets native mercurial source control support.\r\n\r\nMercurial Website: http://mercurial.selenic.com/\r\nMercurial Primer: http://hginit.com/\r\n\r\nThe git support in 4.0 is very good, and I would love to see the same support for mercurial."
