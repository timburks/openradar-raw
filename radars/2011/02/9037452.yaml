    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a child window is added to a window the active Space changes to the Space that the window is on.\r\nThis happens even if the parent window is not a main window.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the user has Window1 and Window2 open. Window1 is on Space1 and Window2 is on Space2. If the user is typing in Window2 and a child window is added to Window1 then the active Space changes to Space1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've attached a simplified app to demonstrate this bug. Download the app and do the following:\r\n- Run the app\r\n- Move the top most window to a different space.\r\n- Click the Start button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe active Space doesn't change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe active Space changes to the Space that contains the first window.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't think this is a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSo far I haven't found any work arounds to this bug. Any help would be appreciated. Currently this is causing a bug on Google Chrome: http://crbug.com/31821"
