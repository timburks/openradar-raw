    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe ALAssetsLibrary enumerateGroupsWithTypes:... method sometimes does not work when called from a thread other than the main thread. This happens when the app has not yet asked the user for permission to use his location (required to use this method). Perhaps the UIAlertView that is shown to ask permissions is not shown on the main thread leading to errors?  (This probably happens with all the AssetsLibrary Framework enumeration methods).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Reset Location warnings on you device\r\n\r\n2. Run an app that enumerates ALAssetLibrary's groups\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAn alert should show asking for permission for locations. If you answer YES, you should be given assets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou won't be given assets. Nothing happens.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is intended, but if it is, it should be clearly documented.\r\n\r\n17-Feb-2011 12:16 PM Jason Gregori:\r\nI forgot to mention that because of this and a lack of documentation I feel uncertain as to whether the classes in the AssetLibrary Framework are thread safe. Are they?"
