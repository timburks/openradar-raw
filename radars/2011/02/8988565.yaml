    description: "11-Feb-2011 09:00 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nSummary:\r\nOn our home network, we have a couple AirPort Expresses. On my iPhone (signed into WiFi) this morning I started playing music, saw the AirTunes icon, and then noticed it had disappeared. I had the same problem last week, where the AirTunes icon was missing. I double-tapped Home and killed iPod.app, but AirTunes was still not available when I relaunched. I turned WiFi off and back on, but no joy.\r\n\r\nI powered down the phone and AirTunes was available when I booted it back up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Sign into WiFi with AirTunes receivers.\r\n1. Launch iPod.app.\r\n2. Play music.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAirTunes button/menu should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo AirTunes button/menu."
