    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using Scripting Bridge on Xcode to try to do automated tests on my iOS device. Basically, I build a product, and tell it to install and launch (debug). The application runs a unit test and exits. I repeat this process for different tests.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that debug() takes a very long time to return after the process has exited. Xcode itself acknowledges the application ending in a timely manner, but the scripting bridge function usually takes over an additional minute for the function to return.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because I want to run a lot of tests and it is painfully slow to wait this extra amount of time for each test.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a Scripting Bridge script written in Lua (using LuaCocoa). You will need to install LuaCocoa to run my script. (It is a simple drag-and-drop install of LuaCocoa.framework to /Library/Frameworks)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Open Xcode with a iOS project that is ready to go. (Hit build to make sure an executable can be launched and make sure you have an iOS device ready to be run on.)\r\n\r\nMake the script executable.\r\nRun ./ScriptingBridge_Xcode_basic.lua\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to launch the executable from the active Xcode project onto your device.\r\n\r\nOnce running, hit the home button to end the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script will end immediately after the home button is pressed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe script hangs for a long time, though it eventually ends.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLuaCocoa can be found here:\r\nhttp://playcontrol.net/opensource/LuaCocoa/\r\nThere is a binary package available."
