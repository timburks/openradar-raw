    description: "09-Feb-2011 11:38 AM Amy Worrall:\r\nSummary:\r\nI would like to be able to use XSLT on the iPhone, without using a web view. The library libxslt is installed but private: making this library public would solve my problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Link against libxslt\r\n2. Submit your app to the app store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp is accepted, and joyous celebration ensues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp is rejected for using private API.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlternatively, clarifying whether we can build our own copy of libxslt and statically link against it would be useful. Some reports on the web say people have done that, and some say that they were still banned for using private APIs."
