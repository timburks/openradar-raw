    description: "When the project file is changed externally by a version control system, Xcode throws exceptions. When clicking \"Continueâ€¦\" the target architecture is wrong. For example, for my iOS app it changes to Mac 64 bit. I've to close and reopen the project to fix it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked just fine under Xcode 3.x: it presented an alert that allowed to reload the project from file and everything was fine.\r\n\r\nThe same issue still occurs in Xcode 4.2 4C114."
