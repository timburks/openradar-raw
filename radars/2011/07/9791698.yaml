    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter a while that Terminal.app is running, switching to it from another window doesn't work properly.\r\nThe Terminal Menu bar correctly appears on top, but no Terminal windows are displayed, even though more than one are open.\r\n\r\nUsing expose it's possible to get back to a Terminal window, but no key input is displayed, unless\r\na mouse click is invoked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.) Open a bunch of Terminal windows\r\n2.) Use other applications for a while\r\n3.) Try to switch back to the Terminal.app using the Dock\r\n4.) Terminal window doesn't activate, only Menubar is displayed correctly.\r\n5.) Use expose to get to a Terminal window\r\n6.) Type something\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe open Terminal windows should be displayed and one made active.\r\nKey input should be displayed within the Terminal window. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTerminal windows are not displayed and none made active.\r\nKey input is not displayed till you click the mouse.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nLion GM, MacBook Air 2.13 GHz, Intel Core 2 Duo, 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n18-Jul-2011 12:50 PM Lukas Pitschl:\r\nThis also happens for other applications like XCode.\r\n\r\nConsole.app doesn't show any errors."
