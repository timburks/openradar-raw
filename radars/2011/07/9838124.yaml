    description: "25-Jul-2011 07:06 PM Matthew Meissner:\r\nSummary:\r\nSafari 5.1 breaks the popular AdBlock extension <http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/>.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Download and install the Safari AdBlock extension from <http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/> or from <https://extensions.apple.com/>.\r\n\r\n2.  Surf the web, click the AdBlock toolbar button, etc.  Notice how well it works.\r\n\r\n3.  Enable private browsing.  Notice that AdBlock is still working.\r\n\r\n4.  Quit Safari while still in Private Browsing mode.\r\n\r\n5.  Open Safari again.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEven though Safari opens in non-private browsing mode, AdBlock should still be able to block ads.  The tool bar button should still work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAdBlock is non-functional -- no ads are blocked and the toolbar button does not respond to clicks.  Disable and re-enable extensions in the Safari preferences to get AdBlock working again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nApparently, Safari 5.1 for Windows is not affected by the problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAccording to the AdBlock developers, this is a Safari bug.  It is being tracked on their Google Code bug tracker:  http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/detail?id=5801"
