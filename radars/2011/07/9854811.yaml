    description: "Summary: Documents icon in the \"recent\" list in app exposé shows pixelated document icons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open iChat. App-exposé it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Crisp icons.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Pixelated icons.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: Attached an screenshot.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to come from iChat since it's the only app with this problem, but the icns resource (savedChatFile.icns) in the iChat.app bundle seems fine."
