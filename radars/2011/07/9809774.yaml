    description: "Summary:\r\nThe callback function of the CFArrayBSearchValues has the arguments reversed from Snow Leopard -- See the the attached project but in summary from my example Snow leopard is passing them back this way\r\n** Edit ** Actually in Lion the values passed can change order from callback to callback\r\n\r\n2011-07-20 13:00:22.646 cfbinarysearch[1886:a0f] val1 class: NSCFString, val2 class NSCFDictionary\r\n\r\nwhile Lion passes them back reversed\r\n7/20/11 1:06:45.737 PM cfbinarysearch: val1 class: __NSCFDictionary, val2 class __NSCFConstantString\r\n\r\nThis is 100% reproducible (see attached sample project)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nMake  CFArrayBinarySearch and run it in both and observe said reversal\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect consistent behaviour -- the docs actually aren't clear on the values passed but they should, I think, be the same (it's not obvious why they should change!?!)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThey are reversed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSee attached -- run it in both SL and Lion to enjoy the differences\r\n\r\nNotes:"
