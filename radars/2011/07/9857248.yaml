    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be truly wonderful if we could set a global custom user-agent string that was used by NSURLConnection unless explicitly overridden in a custom NSURLRequest. Basically, this global value would be set to the request header whenever an NSURLRequest was created, allowing it to be one-off customized by the caller immediately afterwards as needed.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to expose a global key-value request header store rather than solving the problem just for the user-agent. Setting to nil on a global or per-instance basis could restore the Apple default behavior, while setting to the empty string could deliberately submit a clear value.\r\n\r\nRight now, developers must centralize all their NSURLRequest creation so that it contains a custom user-agent. Worse, though, is that there's little that can be done with third-party web service libraries in an app that can't be reached. In many cases, a solution like the one proposed here is the only option.\r\n\r\nSo the idea is:\r\n\r\n[NSURLRequest setValue:@\"MyApp v1.2 iOS\" forHTTPHeaderField:@\"User-Agent\"]; // Class method; all NSURLRequests will now use this field value by default.\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nNSURLRequest *requestOne = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:myURL]; // Preconfigured with the above UA\r\n\r\nNSMutableURLRequest *customRequest = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:myURL]; // Also preconfigured\r\n\r\n[customRequest setValue:@\"AnotherUserAgent\" forHTTPHeaderField:@\"User-Agent\"]; // Overrides global UA\r\n\r\n[customRequest setValue:nil forHTTPHeaderField:@\"User-Agent\"]; // Falls back to the Apple default\r\n\r\nIdeally, this would also affect requests by the Apple frameworks — AVPlayer and MPMoviePlayerController, for instance — but I'll log a separate bug for those just in case."
