    description: "Xcode4 allows to select Build Configuration (e.g. debug, release, etc.) within Schemes separately for every Action e.g. for Run or for Test. This usually makes sense, because you'll have a default setup where you always want a certain style for a certain action. However, sometimes you want to Run or Test your app and not use a debug, but a release build. There is no way how you can tell Xcode to perform either action and use a different build style for it, but only do so once and *NOT* modify the scheme permanently beyond that point.\r\n\r\nSure, you could create a second scheme for that, but then there are two schemes you must keep in sync; this will only lead to issues in the long run. Especially if multiple users are working on the same project and the schemes are \"shared\".\r\n\r\nAnd having to duplicate a scheme each time you want to run it a couple of times with a different configuration is not very user friendly."
