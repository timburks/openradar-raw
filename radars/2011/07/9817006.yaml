    description: "Summary: When in Lion's fullscreen mode, Xcode cannot be on the screen at the same time as the iOS simulator, which is a different application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Xcode. Open an iOS project. Put Xcode in fullscreen mode. Run an application in the simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Simulator appears floating over Xcode as an accessory window, or in an Xcode pane of some kind.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Simulator gets put on one of the global desktops, and it's impossible to watch the Xcode debug console while also watching the simulator window.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: Ideally, the simulator would be part of the Xcode application, rather than its own app."
