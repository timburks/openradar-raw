Even by changing e.g. to resizing using the bottom edge, you should not be able to make it any smaller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe window becomes smaller for a while, then suddenly refuses to resize vertically (as if the minimum size had already been reached, though it visibly hasn't). If you now release the mouse button and resize using the bottom edge, you can make the window even smaller.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
