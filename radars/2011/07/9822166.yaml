    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have apps assigned to all desktops and then activate an app that causes a desktop switch there is a distracting flicker right after the animation has completed. It appears that this happens because apps assigned to all desktops are hidden before the animation starts and then shown after the animation ends. This looks fine when doing a manual desktop switch but an app activation desktop switch animates at a faster rate than a manual desktop switch. The reshowing of the app at the end of the animation causes flicker.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Mission Control to create multiple desktops\r\nLaunch an app and assign it to all desktops\r\nLaunch another app and make sure it's only assigned to a single desktop\r\nLaunch another app and make sure it's only assigned to a single desktop other than the app in the previous step\r\nMake sure that the app assigned to all desktops is not hidden behind either of the other app windows in their respective desktops.\r\nSwitch between the 2 apps assigned to single desktops by clicking on their dock icons. This should cause a desktop switch.\r\nNotice the flicker as the desktop switch animation ends.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the animation would be more fluid and not appear flickery.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe reshowing of apps assigned to all desktops looks like flicker. It actually looks like the app is made visible as part of the switch animation and then very quickly hidden and reshown again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis does not happen in 10.6 as apps assigned to all desktops are not hidden prior to the desktop switch animation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is more apparent when the app assigned to all desktops is near the right or left edge of the screen."
