    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Mac App Store should support gifting applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to an application, say, OS X Lion.\r\n2. Click the disclosure arrow next to the Buy/Installed button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Click \"Gift this application...\".\r\n4. Fill out information on who it should be gifted to and the gift message.\r\n5. Confirm purchase.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. No \"Gift\" option is visible.\r\n4. Open the iTunes Store via iTunes.\r\n5. Purchase a gift certificate and send that via email.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI wanted to gift Lion to a family member. Sending them a gift certificate instead meant they had to call me so I could walk them through the redemption process and starting the Lion download. If I could have gifted them the app directly, they would have been much less confused and much happier about the process!"
