    description: "Summary: When Finder is performing lengthy tasks, different actions appear in their own windows when they should group into one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Make Finder perform multiple lengthy tasks (such as Copy File, Time Machine Backup, Delete File or Empty Trash) at the same time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The progress information views for all lengthy tasks appear underneath each other in a single window.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Different kinds of tasks appear in separate windows. Only related tasks appear underneath each other in the same window. For example, multiple \"Delete File\" actions and an \"Empty Trash\" action will all appear in the same window (called “Trash”), but a Time Machine Backup will appear in a different window.\r\n\r\nNotes: This is very much a cosmetic issue, but I think it makes sense to group all information on lengthy tasks into a single window, just like it makes sense to group all iOS notifications into a single Notification Center."
