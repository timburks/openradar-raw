    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you change the modifier keys in your preferences and reboot your machine, they are being set back to defaults as if those settings were never stored to disk.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to System Preferences\r\n2. Select Keyboard\r\n3. Select Modifier Keys...\r\n4. Change the modifier keys, e.g. swap ALT and CMD (ALT is changed to CMD, CMD is changed to ALT)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter reboot, the modifier keys are still set the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe modifier keys are set back to their default values.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Information Appended 07-Jan-2011:\r\n\r\nI could reproduce this issue with Mac OS X 10.7.2 and it seems to be related to the fact, that the system somehow recognizes my USB keyboard twice. It shows up as \"<name>\" and \"<name> 1\". If I only change the modifier keys for one of both and then reboot, they are restored after the reboot. However, if I change them on both, they stay permanent."
