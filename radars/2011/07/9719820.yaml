    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have code that loads a .icns file into an NSImage and then writes that file out to a different location via CGImageDestination. Starting with 10.6.8 this no longer works. The file written by CGImageDestination is corrupt. Preview cannot open it. Attempting to open it again with NSImage results in an image with on internal representations. Additionally, the size of the file written is greater twice the size of the original file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Load a .icns file with NSImage\r\n2) Write the NSImage to disk using CGImageDestination\r\n3) Notice that the image written is invalid and unopenable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOutput image is effectively a copy of the input image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOutput image is invalid/corrupt.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works in 10.6.7 and 10.7 previews. It stopped working in 10.6.8."
