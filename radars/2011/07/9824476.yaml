    description: "Summary: It is not possible to shrink the vertical size of larger Carbon windows beyond an arbitrary limit by grabbing the bottom left corner\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download Fetch 5.6 from http://fetchsoftworks.com\r\n2. Launch Fetch 5.6 and click the Try button in the welcome alert\r\n3. A window appears with a sheet. Choose the \"Fetch Softworks\" shortcut from the shortcuts menu (with the heart icon) and click Connect\r\n4. Move the window to the top of the screen\r\n5. Click in the bottom-right corner and resize the window to be about as tall as the screen\r\n6. Click in the bottom-left corner and try to shrink the height of the window\r\n\r\nExpected Results: You can shrink the window until it is shorter than it was to start\r\n\r\nActual Results: The resizing is limited (but if you click in the lower right corner you can shrink the window much further)\r\n\r\nRegression: This wasn't an issue on Snow Leopard, but then SL did not have left-side resizing\r\n\r\nNotes:"
