    description: "04-Jul-2011 12:23 PM Camron Flanders:\r\nSummary: When receiving a SMS/MMS/iMessage notification banner, either on the homescreen or in another app, the contact's phone number is shown instead of their name. This is for every contact, and every contact has the phone numbers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Get a SMS/MMS/iMessage. 2. See that there is no name\r\n\r\nExpected Results: To see the Contact's name - eg, Johnny Appleseed, not 555-555-1234\r\n\r\nActual Results: I see the phone number instead of the name\r\n\r\nRegression: Yes, iOS 5 beta 1 worked fine\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niPhone 4, GSM\r\niOS 5 beta 2"
