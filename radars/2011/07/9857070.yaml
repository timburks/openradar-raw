    description: "Summary:\r\nThe three gestures for Mission Control do not allow for temporarily applying the respective feature. This is different from 10.6, where the two Exposé gestures (four-finger swipe down or app for Show All Windows or Show Desktop, respectively) did allow this by keeping the fingers held down after enacting the gesture. This is also different from the Mission Control keyboard shortcuts, where keeping the respective keystroke held down, too, was an option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Go to System Preferences → Trackpad → More Gestures.\r\n2) Enable the gestures to Mission Control, App Exposé and Show Desktop, with the respective setting Swipe up with four fingers, Swipe down with four fingers, and Spread with thumb and three fingers.\r\n3) Go to System Preferences → Mission Control → Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts.\r\n4) Set the shortcuts for Mission Control: F9, Application windows: F10, and Show Desktop: F11.\r\n5a) Swipe up with four fingers, then keep holding the four fingers.\r\n5b) Press and hold F9.\r\n6) After a moment, let go.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter 5), Mission Control will appear. After 6), it should disappear again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter 5a), Mission Control will appear. After 6), it will not disappear.\r\n\r\nHowever, after 5b), Mission Control will appear, and will disappear after 6).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn 10.6, this worked for both gestures (5a) and keyboard shortcuts (5b)."
