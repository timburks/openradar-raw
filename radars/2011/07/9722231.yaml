    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen you try to position an NSPopover relative to the view of a status bar item, no text input is sent to any controls in the popover's view. Buttons work fine, but no text fields (or buttons with key equivalents) respond to keyboard input. You can programatically set the contents of text fields, but you can't get text fields into focus.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee the attached Xcode project. It:\r\n\r\n1. Creates an NSStatusItem,\r\n2. Sets a custom view for that status item,\r\n3. Tells the custom view to override mouseDown:, and\r\n4. Tells the popover to show, positioned relative to the custom view when the custom view is clicked on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen the popover is shown, the user should be able to get the text field into focus (and if a button has a key equivalent set, that key should fire the action for that button).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe text field can't come into focus, even when you set it to be the first responder, and buttons with key equivalents don't fire when the relevant key combo is pressed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nProblem occurs on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, up to and including the GM.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
