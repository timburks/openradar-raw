    description: "Since monitors of today offer a lot more width than height, why is the list of local variables located BELOW the source files, thus allowing the source code editor to only show very few lines of code, instead of allowing to place it BESIDE the source code, as was possible with Xcode 3? I can probably better show the problem using two screenshots, one of Xcode 3 and one of Xcode 4. Debugging is really a pain in Xcode 4 if you can sometimes only see 8 lines above and below your current breakpoint, while in Xcode 3 you could usually see the whole method/function at once.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshots (as a single ZIP):\r\nxcode3_lots_of_source.png\r\nxcode4_little_source.png"
