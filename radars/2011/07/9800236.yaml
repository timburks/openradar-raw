    description: "Summary:\r\nIcons in finder should only display a preview if it is beneficial to identifying the file. In the case of text files displaying at an icon size smaller than 256x256 showing a preview is actually detrimental to identification as everything becomes a white page with indistinguishable black scribbles. This effect is worst in list view using the 16x16 icons. In these cases using application provided icons (E.G. Word's blue documents or Dreamweaver's green html/php files) makes identification easier.\r\n\r\nTurning off icon previews across the board is not a solution as they aid tremendously in the identification of media files like images and videos even at the 16x16 resolution. Rather a behavior that is smart about when to show a preview and when to show an icon would be ideal. A 256px size document icon should show text preview but a 64px should not."
