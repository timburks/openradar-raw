    description: "The Safari Webpage Preview Fetcher tries to fetch certain files from disk, and is denied the privilege to do so by the sandboxd. This results in many log messages of the form \"Safari Webpage P([PID]) deny file-read-data [path]\".\r\n\r\nThe three files the SWPF tries to access are:\r\n1. My custom stylesheet, as set in the \"Advanced\" tab of the Safari preferences.\r\n2. The shared (not per-user) preferences, in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist.\r\n3. Safari's initial preferences, in /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/Defaults.plist.\r\n\r\nThe SWPF should be given access to all three of these in order to generate accurate previews. (Right now, the previews it generates do not match the dimensions of the preview cells in Top Sites, and use the wrong font size.)"
