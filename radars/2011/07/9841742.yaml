    description: "Summary:\r\nxcode/gdb stops at a breakpoint but indicates that it is stopped at the previously executed autocontinue breakpoint in all source code views and (3.2.x) when querying in the gdb console. xcode/gdb does not correct itself until you step over or into a line.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- add a breakpoint and set its action to log some information including values of one or more variables in scope at the break point, and set it to continue\r\n- add a simple breakpoint on a line you want to stop at.\r\n- ensure:\r\n    - both breakpoints are in the same file (it might also happen when they are in different files - not certain)\r\n    - the autocontinue breakpoint must be reached first\r\n    - the source files are open in different windows\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- when I break at the simple breakpoint, it should show me that breakpoint in source code and I should be able to confirm it via the gdb console\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- xcode indicates (by means of smaller arrow on top of breakpoint arrow) that the executable is stopped at the last autocontinue breakpoint that was hit (even though it is not stopped there)\r\n- this happens both \r\na) when the executable is still running\r\nb) when the executable is stopped at a different simple breakpoint (in a different function many lines away)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been happening in all xcode 3.2.x and possibly 3.1.x. I had hoped that it was fixed in 4.x, but as I'm a late upgrader, I've only just found out that its not fixed. I can't verify in 4.2 because it won't build my project at the moment.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n(I've had lots of failed debugging sessions, wasted time and frustration with this bug over the last few years (on several different machines), but haven't been able to pin it down so precisely before now.)"
