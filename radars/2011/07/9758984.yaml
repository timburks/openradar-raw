    description: "At the moment it seems that the GPX support in Xcode 4.2 for setting the location information only supports single waypoints.  While this is useful, what would be better would be support for sequences of waypoints.  Ie, paths.\r\n\r\nI realize that you can use UIAutomation in Instruments to simulate \"travel\".  But because you can't connect a debugger to instruments this makes the debugging process of \"travel\" related bugs a whole lot of NSLog hell.\r\n\r\nWhat would be preferred would be for the GPX files to support waypoint lists.  The actual file format does support this.  Eg:\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<gpx\r\n  version=\"1.0\"\r\n  creator=\"GPSBabel - http://www.gpsbabel.org\"\r\n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\r\n  xmlns=\"http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0\"\r\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0 http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0/gpx.xsd\">\r\n<time>2011-06-29T05:52:44Z</time>\r\n<bounds minlat=\"-37.863259791\" minlon=\"144.959372386\" maxlat=\"-37.840941643\" maxlon=\"145.001237243\"/>\r\n<trk>\r\n  <name>AlbertPartToPrahran</name>\r\n<trkseg>\r\n<trkpt lat=\"-37.841483888\" lon=\"144.961548488\">\r\n  <ele>0.000000</ele>\r\n</trkpt>\r\n<trkpt lat=\"-37.841480517\" lon=\"144.961463640\">\r\n  <ele>0.000000</ele>\r\n</trkpt>\r\n<trkpt lat=\"-37.841334030\" lon=\"144.961444865\">\r\n  <ele>0.000000</ele>\r\n</trkpt>\r\n<trkpt lat=\"-37.841166150\" lon=\"144.961503880\">\r\n  <ele>0.000000</ele>\r\n</trkpt>\r\n</trkseg>\r\n</trk>\r\n</gpx>\r\n\r\nBut Xcode does not.  <sadface/>\r\n\r\nIn order to simulate this sort of behaviour I have to create loads of .gpx files with a single way point in them, and then slowly work my way through selecting each file in turn to set the location in the debugger.  This is no fun.\r\n\r\nPlease improve this feature."
