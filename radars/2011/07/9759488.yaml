    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode3 had the concept of a main window, you could also call it a project window. Closing this window closed all aux windows and further re-opening a project window restores this window exactly as it used to be. Xcode4 lacks support of this concept and this leads to the issue, that when you are not closing you \"designated project window\" as the last window of a project, you lost it and have to restore everything from scratch next time you open the project. See Steps to Reproduce and you'll get a better impression of what I really mean by that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new, empty project\r\n2. You'll see window that shows the project navigator to the left, a source code editor to the right, and the toolbar on top. We call this one \"project window\".\r\n3. Add a source code file to that project; any file will do.\r\n4. Double click this source code file.\r\n5. The source code file opens in a new window, which only has an editor inside by default. We call this \"aux window\".\r\n6. Close the \"project window\"; the \"aux window\" is still there since Xcode4 has no concept of a main window that would close the entire project when being closed.\r\n7. Close the \"aux window\"; the project is closed as a whole.\r\n8. Re-open the project by double clicking the project file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI get back the \"project window\" or the \"project window\" and the \"aux window\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI only get back the \"aux window\", the project window is gone forever, there is no way to get it back other than \"turning\" the \"aux window\" into a project window, that means re-sizing it, make the toolbar show, make the project navigator show. That way I have lost my \"aux window\" forever and have to create a new one.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA possible fix to this issue, other than re-adding the concept of a project window, could be a Behavior named \"Project opens\", which can be configured accordingly to make Xcode restore a project window the way I would like to see it each time I re-open an existing project."
