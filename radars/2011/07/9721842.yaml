    description: "05-Jul-2011 02:21 AM A Roest:\r\nSummary:\r\nMy iPhone 3GS contained iOS 5 beta 1 (from WWDC). Yesterday I made a backup, and restored with the new beta\r\nios_5_beta_2__iphone_3gs__9a5248d\r\nafter the usual jumping through hoops, it finally declared finished and restored my apps. I was gladly surprised (then), that this only took three minutes, instead of the usual 1,5 hours. I hoped Apple made it's first step to over-the-air updates. Alas\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nupdate to iOS 5.0b2, with iTunes 10.5.b27\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFull restore of email, calendar, music, videos and apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nrestore of email accounts (not the email itself, not nice with pop accounts)\r\nNO music\r\nNO photos\r\nNO videos\r\nNot all calendar accounts restored\r\nNO apps, beyond those of Apple.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nfix please? Now I have to manually select and reinstall more than one hundred apps. Even though they are still selected in iTunes. Not too mention creating many app folders. Tedious ^2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nmea culpa for installing it on my normal phone, but it doesn't install on my 3G test phone."
