    description: "I would like to make a request about the Mac App Store and a specific section for Lion Server with extended capabilities regarding the review guidelines.\r\n\r\nI'm a system administrator and also a developer. Sometime I write some custom admin tool for my client, and I think this tools can be really useful for a lot of other people.\r\n\r\nThat could really friendly for people who work on Lion Server to add a specific section on the Mac App Store, dedicated to Lion Server and where privileges escalations and launchd access,  are allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the specific point who give us a real problem:\r\n\r\n2.15: \"Apps must be self-contained, single application installation bundles, and cannot install code or resources in shared locations.\"\r\nIf we want to make a custom service (for accounting software or whatever) we need to use /Library/Application Support (or any custom user location) to write data, we can't put that in the user home folder.\r\n\r\n2.23: \"Apps that spawn processes that continue to run after a user has quit the app without user consent will be rejected\"\r\nWe need that to make server applications \r\n\r\n2.27: \"Apps that request escalation to root privileges or use setuid attributes will be rejected\"\r\nWe need root access for editing a lot of configuration file and for keep some data out of access for standard user who can access to the server."
