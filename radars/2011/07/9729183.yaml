    description: "I had a couple of very useful text formating scripts that I cannot use any longer with Xcode 4. Those \"stupid\" code snippets are far from being a replacement (actually I consider them pretty much useless for real developers and they are buggy and often the completion shortcut fails, despite the fact that it doesn't allow plenty of useful characters at all - but this is another bug). Sure, I can convert those scripts to Automator services and then assigning them a system wide shortcut does work, but first of all I don't need any of these scripts system wide and second running the script that way makes it perform TEN TIMES SLOWER than from the script menu within Xcode 3.\r\nPlease bring back this really useful functionality!"
