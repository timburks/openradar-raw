    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Media Library in Interface Builder is great and you can drop images easily on a view. \r\n\r\nBut nowadays, as buttons most often contain an icon (and especially on iOS) you need to add images as buttons as well. \r\n\r\nWhat I am thinking about is: \r\n- dropping an image while holding alt or ctrl opens a context menu to ask if you want to add an image or button. \r\n- A menu item (like those contained in \"Embed In\") that replaces a UIImage by a (custom) UIButton (same with NSâ€¦)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-N/A-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-N/A-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such functionality exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-N/A-\r\n\r\nNotes:"
