    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCurrently to leave a review the user has to explicitly go to the App Store or use a custom feature some applications have implemented that asks the user about leaving a review and takes them to the appropriate page in the App Store.\r\nIt would be great if the OS takes care of presenting such a dialog if for example the user uses the app for a certain amount of time (e.g. multiple times in a 2-week period). The OS could then present a little dialog like the new compose dialog for tweets in iOS 5 which does not force the user to leave the application."
