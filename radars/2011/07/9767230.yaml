    description: At the bottom of the project navigator is a search field, which can be used to filter the view to files only matching a certain search pattern. There is no keyboard shortcut to focus this field. Following Apples own UI pattern, this field should be focusable using ALT+CMD+F, but instead this focuses "Find" in the current editor and sets it to replace.
