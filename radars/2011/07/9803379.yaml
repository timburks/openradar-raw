    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nQuitting the iPhone Simulator app during debugging when the app being debugged is not frontmost causes a SIGTERM crash in main for the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create new iOS project (I did it with View Based Project, it will probably work with any type)\r\n\r\n2. Run the app\r\n\r\n3. Hit the home button on the simulator\r\n\r\n4. Once at Simulator Springboard, quit the simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Simulator exits cleanly\r\n\r\n2. Debugging session exits cleanly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Simulator exists cleanly\r\n\r\n2. App being debugged crashes in main() with a SIGTERM\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is something new in a recent version iOS SDK, I'm not sure which version introduced this."
