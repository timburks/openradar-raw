    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n* when users are given access to a wiki in OSX server through group membership rather than explicitly, email to the wiki distribution list is not delivered to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* create a wiki that is not public (eg: \"Staff\").\r\n\r\n* add the group \"Staff\" to the access list (eg. read only), as well as adding several accounts explicitly (eg. with r/w access)\r\n\r\n* send an email to the wiki distribution list staff-wiki@example.com\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* all accounts that have been added to the wiki, either implicitly or explicitly, will receive the email\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* only the user accounts that have been explicitly added in the /groups/staff/settings/ permissions pane will receive the email. accounts whose membership is via. the \"Staff\" group that has been granted permission will not receive the email\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* this makes large-scale wiki deployments impossible to manage, as access control must be handled through the wiki preferences pages rather than leveraging group membership already handled in OpenDirectory."
