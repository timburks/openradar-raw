    description: "Summary: iTunes Connect is presently a website and 'web app'. It is inconvenient and subject to the frustrations of web browsers. An iTunes Connect native application for Mac would be greatly convenient and more usable for developers (iTunes Connect.app). Presently the iOS app does not and cannot provide all of the functionality of iTunes Connect. A native Mac application would be able to provide all the functionality.\r\n\r\nNotes: Of course the website should also be kept running. Remote access is more convenient at times."
