    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you have webclip icons on your SpringBoard, then open the multitasking bar, rather becoming semi-transparent, they become completely transparent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add a webclip to the Home Screen.\r\n2) Double click the Home button to open the multitasking bar\r\n3) Notice that the webclip icon becomes semi-transparent\r\n4) Close the multitasking bar and switch SpringBoard pages, then go back to the original SpringBoard page\r\n5) Re-open the multitasking bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icon should be semi-transparent as before\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe icon is completely transparent\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested on an iPod touch 4th-generation\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've only tested this with webclips that use a custom icon. I have tried it with several of them, but have not tested it with webclips that use a screenshot of the page for their icon.\r\n\r\n\r\n19-Jul-2011 12:20 PM Patrick Collins :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nCould you please take a screenshot of this issue and attach it to your bug report?\r\n\r\n\r\n19-Jul-2011 12:54 PM Mike Beasley:\r\n'photo.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n19-Jul-2011 12:54 PM Mike Beasley:\r\nSure, here it is. There are three webclips on this page: Basecamp, Facebook and Mike Beasley. As you can see, Mail, Music, Camera and Echofon are not affected, but the webclips are.\r\n\r\nAlso, while putting all my webclips onto one page, I found some other useful information. Webclips that run inside Safari are not affected. Only \"webapp\" style webclips are affected. You can see that the webclip to my Favstar pages (\"@MikeBeas\" and \"@iMikeBeas\") on the home screen) are not affected. The rest of the webclips run as webapps without Safari, and are affected by the bug.\r\n\r\n22-Jul-2011 08:13 PM Mike Beasley:\r\nThis is resolved in beta 4.\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
