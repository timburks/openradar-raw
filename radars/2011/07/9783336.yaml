    description: "15-Jul-2011 01:51 PM Jeremy Sherman:\r\nSummary:\r\nIndentation preferences are currently application-wide:\r\n  * Prefer indent with: tab/spaces\r\n  * Tab width\r\n  * Indent width\r\n\r\nThis causes a problem when you switch between projects with different indentation styles. It can also cause a problem within a project when that project includes code from another project in a different style.\r\n\r\nMaking indentation preferences a project-level preference with the ability to override on a per-file basis would fix this. The current application preference would remain but would act as the default style for newly created projects and for projects that don't specify a style (old projects).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Work on a project that uses 4-space with spaces indentation.\r\n* Switch to a project that uses 3-space with tabs indentation the next day.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* No problem! Indentation is below your notice, and has been working just fine without you, thanks to the project level settings stored in the .pbxproj file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* Realize 2 hours in that you've been indenting wrong the whole time.\r\n* Change your indentation preferences.\r\n* Spend several boring minutes deleting spaces, since ^I does not reformat code that sort of seems already correctly formatted, even if it's not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A. This is a feature request.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would be like modelines in Emacs or vim, but less in your face (no decorator lines in each file) and more convenient (because the notion of a project prevents you from having to respecify the setting for each and every file)."
