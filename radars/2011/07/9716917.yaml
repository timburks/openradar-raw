    description: "Summary:\r\nMobile Safari should have an \"Open in...\" button in its actions menu, similar to the menu for Mail attachments, to open the currently viewed page in any other application that registers as capable of opening HTML documents or URLs.\r\n\r\nThis could use the CFBundleDocumentTypes/LSItemContentTypes mechanisms from iOS 3.2+, and should be able to pass both the URL and the HTML content of the currently-viewed page to the selected target application.\r\n\r\nThis could benefit hundreds (possibly thousands) of apps on the Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn \"Open in...\" button in the actions menu of Mobile Safari to send the current page's URL and HTML content to any app that registers itself as capable of opening HTML documents.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSadness.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI make Instapaper. You just made Reading List. I'm not upset about that, but the least you can do is add this \"Open in...\" button below the \"Add to Reading List\" item on that precious-real-estate actions menu. :)"
