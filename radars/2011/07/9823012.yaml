    description: "Summary:\r\nI've enabled \"Display unread messages with bold font\" and disabled \"Use classic layout\".\r\nUnread Mails are not shown in bold. They can only identified by the blue dot which is very hard to glance when browsing through lots of emails quickly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnread messages should be displayed in bold.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sender is always bold, the subject is always plain, no matter whether it's read or unread.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWhen using \"classic layout\", unread messages are displayed in bold just fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't wanna switch back to classic mode just for this feature. I appreciate the wide layout (better suited for wide screen displays) and the \"show contact photos\" features."
