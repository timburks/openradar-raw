    description: "06-Jul-2011 11:02 AM Mark Townsend:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI create a project that has a UI that contains a UITextField and a UILabel.  I am using the UITextField delegate method textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString: to change the text property of the label.  Using the iOS 4.3 sim with Xcode 4.1+ this leads to an exception being thrown. (objc_assign_ivar)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load and build sample project\r\n2. Run in either iPad or iPhone 4.3 sim\r\n3. Start entering in text into the text field.\r\n4. Watch it crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText entered into textfield shows up on label as it's being typed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nException is thrown, objc_assign_ivar\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works in iOS 4.3 sim using Xcode 4.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI tried this with the iOS 5.0 sim and it seems to work as expected.  I tried this on a device running iOS 4.3 and it worked as expected.  This also works in the iOS 4.3 sim using Xcode 4.0.2."
