    description: "Summary: iChat sends messages repeatedly while typing when using a Yahoo! account, when you haven't hit the return key yet. The text being typed remains in the message entry field until you do actually hit the return key, at which point it is sent again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Add a Yahoo! account to iChat. Try to have a conversation with a buddy.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Messages shouldn't be sent until the return key is pressed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Messages are repeatedly sent while typing."
