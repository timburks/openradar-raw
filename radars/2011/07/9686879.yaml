    description: "Summary: When writing you commit message, there's no shortcut to actually finish the commit process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open an Xcode project with source control, make some changes, and commit in File > Source Control > Commit. Enter a commit message. Try to finish the commit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A shortcut to be available, like command-enter.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No shortcut available, using the mouse is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nRegression : Command-enter was available as a shortcut in Xcode 3.x\r\n\r\nNotes:"
