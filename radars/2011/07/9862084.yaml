    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you add a person to your address book, Mail.app usually prefers the name you set for this person, instead of the name the sender specified when sending his mail. Mail.app fails to do so in the message list (the part showing all mails in a folder) and always shows the name stored in the \"From\" / \"Sender\" headers of the mail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Receive mail from someone, for example \"jdoe42 <jdoe42@example.com>\".\r\n- Add this e-mail address to your address book, specifying \"John Doe\" as the full name.\r\n- Looking at Mail.app, you see the full name used in the view showing the mail, but not used in the message list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The message list also shows the full name I specified for the user, overriding the value specified in the headers of the mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The message shows just the e-mail address or the name specified by the sender in the \"From\" or \"Sender\" header of the mail."
