    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen NSScrollView is layer-backed, it fades content in as it scrolls. This behavior looks pretty odd and is often not wanted. There doesn't appear to be a way to turn it off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a scroll view.\r\n2. Mark it as being layer-backed.\r\n3. Scroll.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Scroll view would behave as it does when not layer-backed. Content would appear instantly as it scrolls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Scroll view fades content in as it scroll.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached example project."
