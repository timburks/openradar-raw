    description: "This is a dupe of rdar://9735877 , just adding my vote. \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt would be useful, in code bases where due to coding style guidelines dot syntax is not allowed, to be able to specify a compiler flag to turn on a warning (which could then be combined with -Werror if desired), to warn upon use of dot syntax for Objective-C objects.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build a project which uses dot syntax.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBe able to receive warning in places where dot syntax is used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDot syntax has to be removed completely by hand (without the aid of warnings or analyzer results) if it is desirable to remove it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
