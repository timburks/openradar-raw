    description: "Summary:\r\nCIPageCurlTransition (also CIPageCurlWithShadowTransition) behave incorrectly on Mac OS 10.7 (Build 11A494A).\r\nWith certain \"inputAngles\" the curled layer is cut off. This has been reproduced on several hardware configurations and does not occur on Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. create a layer and set its contents or background color\r\n1. create a CIFilter with name CIPageCurlTransition\r\n2. set parameters to default\r\n3. provide backside-, shading- and target image\r\n4. set the input extend to the bounds of the layer the filter is applied to\r\n5. set the inputTime to 0.6\r\n6. set the inputAngle to -3.0 (whereas an inputAngle of -0.14 works as expected)\r\n7. apply the filter to the layer\r\n\r\n(an example project is attached)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe curled geometry should be wrapped around (like with an inputAngle of -0.14).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe curled geometry is cut off.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe CIPageCurlTransition works as expected on Snow Leopard. The behaviour is reproducible\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn example project to reproduce the bug is attached."
