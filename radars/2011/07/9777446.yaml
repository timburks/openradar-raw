    description: "Summary: After doing a restore of iOS, using a backup, any samples that are in iBooks are removed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Download some book samples in iBooks\r\n2. Back up the device using iTunes\r\n3. Install an iOS update that requires a restore, or click the Restore button in iTunes\r\n4. Choose to restore from the backup when prompted\r\n5. Wait for the restore to complete, then open iBooks\r\n\r\nExpected Results: iBooks should appear almost exactly how it was before the restore. In particular things I downloaded and may have been in the middle of reading should still be there.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Any free samples that were downloaded appear briefly before disappearing.\r\n\r\nRegression: I believe iBooks has always done this.\r\n\r\nNotes: I understand why this happens: the sample book data is stored in an are that doesn't get backed up. The books are still listed in the iBooks database, but when it fails to find the data the samples are deleted.\r\n\r\nI often download samples of books I'm interested in. Assuming this data is not important to me is a poor assumption. You're also deleting a sales opportunity. Please consider storing this data in an area that is backed up OR offer me the option to re-download the samples after doing a restore."
