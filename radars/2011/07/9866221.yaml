    description: "Note: duplicate of #7609873\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 3, one could hold the alt-key to restrict a find&Replace to the current selection in the text editor (not the global Find). In Xcode 4.1, this does not work anymore and there does not seem to be any way to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen an Xcode project, select any file with source code. In the Find bar on top, choose the 'Replace' option. Now, there are fields for the Find and the Replace, and a button to 'Replace All'. Holding the 'alt' key does not change the button label to 'Replace All in Selection', nor are there any way to restrict the Replace to the current selection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nHolding the 'alt' key should change the button label to 'Replace All in Selection', or there could be an additional button or checkbox just for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt was working in Xcode 3.2."
