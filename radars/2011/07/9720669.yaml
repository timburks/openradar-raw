    description: "Summary:\r\nSignificant location change in iOS4.0 works as intended. Application gets updated when there is a significant location change. But in iOS5.0, this is no longer reliable. Almost 90% of the time, location update is almost random when comparing side-by-side with a device running iOS4.0 and the same test app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse stopMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges when application is in background. \r\nEvery time location is updated in background, use a local notification to display update. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTest app running on iOS4.0 and iOS5.0 should have similar intervals for location update.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTest app running on iOS5.0 gets updated a lot less frequent, and sometimes over longer distance, than iOS4.0.\r\ne.g. Over distance of 20km, iOS4.0 gets updated 9 times, but iOS5.0 only gets updated 2 times. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-"
