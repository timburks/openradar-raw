    description: "Summary:\r\nMerging windows in full screen mode leads to a Safari crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) On Lion, put a Safari window into full screen mode.\r\n2) Open a new tab, then drag it off of the tab bar to create a new window. You should now have two full screen windows and no other Safari windows.\r\n3) Go to Window > Merge All Windows\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe windows should merge and everyone should go about their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe windows merge, but the window goes back to the first desktop as if it was leaving full screen mode. However, the window frame still acts like it is in full screen mode, and does not show the title bar, traffic light buttons or full screen button. The menu bar does not have the Exit Full Screen button next to Spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the window back to normal, you have to go to View > Exit Full Screen Mode. This causes Safari to suddenly quit. Sometimes you don't even need to try to exit full screen mode for the crash to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on Lion GM running the included version of Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCrash logs are attached.
