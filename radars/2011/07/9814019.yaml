    description: "Summary:\r\nSince time immemorial (at least, predating Mac OS X), Mac OS “Do you want to save the changes you made in Foo?” alerts have had the shortcut command-D for “Don’t Save”. The new “close confirmation save dialog” in Mac OS X Lion does not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Open TextEdit.\r\n* Create a new document.\r\n* Type something, anything.\r\n* Close the window. (A close confirmation save dialog appears.)\r\n* Press command-D.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* The dialog should be dismissed as though “Don’t Save” had been clicked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* Nothing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe corresponding interface in AppKit for 10.6 responded to command-D."
