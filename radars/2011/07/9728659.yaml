    description: "NB: Fixed in iOS5b3\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA number of methods in the ALAssetRepresentation class cause hangs and crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nObtain an instance of ALAsset through either ALAssetsGroup's -enumerateAssetsUsingBlock: method or ALAssetsLibrary's -assetForURL:resultBlock:failureBlock: method. Obtain an ALAssetRepresentation instance using -defaultRepresentation. Send messages to the ALAssetRepresentation method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nfullScreenImage - a CGImage representation of the asset is returned at the resolution of the screen.\r\nfullResolutionImage - a CGImage representation of the asset is returned at the original resolution of the asset.\r\nsize - the size of the asset's data is returned.\r\nmetadata - an NSDictionary is returned containing the Asset's EXIF and other data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nfullScreenImage - after a hang (normally approx 1-2s), a blank CGImage is returned.\r\nfullResolutionImage - app crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\nsize - app crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\nmetadata - app crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll methods work as expected in iOS 4.3"
