    description: There is no way to do a search & replace *only* within the current selection of a source file. Almost every simple text editor on the Mac can do that, how can it be that is missing from Xcode? You don't always want to make a search & replace within a whole source file and having to decided upon replace for every item found by hand is so painful, that one can as well do it all by hand with copy/paste.
