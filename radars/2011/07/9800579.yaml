    description: "Summary:\r\nItems in the trash usually cannot be opened, but if they are put on the Dock they will open without a problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Put an item in the trash\r\n2) Drag the item from the trash to the Dock\r\n3) Click the Dock icon for the item\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe typical \"This item cannot be opened because it is in the trash\" dialog should stop the item from opening, just as if you were double-clicking the item in the trash folder in a Finder window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe item opens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested with a PDF and a ZIP archive. Does NOT work with applications in the trash. Those are blocked by the usual popup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 20-Jul-2011: Apple has decided that this does not pose a security threat and re-classified it as \"other.\" I would say that there are definitely some security issues here, but whatever."
