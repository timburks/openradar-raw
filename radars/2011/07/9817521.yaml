    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari 5.1 running on a 10.6.8 machine crashes when attempting to load a web page that requires the use of a Kerberos Certificate Authority (KCA) for authentication.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo reproduce this bug, you will need to have a Kerberos Certificate Authority infrastructure in place, though it might also fail with any x509 certificate infrastructure. You will also need a Mac running 10.6.8 with all security and Java updates current as of 7/21/11\r\n\r\n1. Obtain a valid KCA certificate.\r\n2. Import the certificate into user keychain using Keychain Access and set trust values for certificate to \"Allows \r\n3. Launch Safari 5.1\r\n4. Navigate to a site that requires authenticating with a KCA certificate\r\n\r\nAt this point, Safari 5.1 will crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnder previous versions of Safari 5.0.x, upon landing at the site, Safari would either display a prompt asking which certificate to use for authentication or would automatically proceed if a certificate had previously been declared.\r\n\r\nHave duplicate the results on multiple machines running both Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server 10.6.8.\r\nHave duplicated the results with WebKit nightly download build r91478\r\n\r\nSafari 5.1 (7534.50) running on a Windows 7 PC correctly uses certificate authentication and successfully loads sites.\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome 12.0.742.122, another WebKit browser, successfully recognizes certificates and correctly loads all pages without crash or error.\r\n\r\nProblem appears confined to Macs running 10.6.8 and Safari 5.1.\r\n\r\nThe five attached files are are an Apple System Profiler Report, two Safari crash logs and two Instruments trace files run during crashes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInformation about KCAs: http://computing.fnal.gov/xms/Services/Getting_Services/Certificates/what_is_a_certificate\r\n\r\nSee also Webkit bug 64977"
