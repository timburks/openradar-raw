    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTwitter Contact Sync feature replaces user-entered information with incorrect info.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave contacts that have multiple email addresses and multiple Twitter accounts. Do not list the twitter accounts on their contact cards. Run the Twitter Contact Sync in the Twitter settings pane. Modify one of the Twitter accounts listed in a contact card. Run the Contact Sync again. Return to the contact card and verify which twitter account is listed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe corrected account that the user entered should be listed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTwitter has overwritten user changes with incorrect information again.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nI have multiple twitter accounts. Some of them are tied to email addresses listed in my contact card. When I ran twitter contact sync from the Settings app, it pulled the wrong account name based on the wrong email address and listed it on my contact card. I simply corrected the username listed on my contact card. I added a few more contacts and ran the twitter sync again. To my dismay, my twitter username had reverted to the incorrect one that I had previously changed. This happened to several of my contacts that have multiple twitter accounts.\r\n\r\nA suggested fix would be to simply leave user-entered data alone during the twitter sync and ignore contacts that already have Twitter accounts listed (like what is done with the profile picture sync. Contacts that already have pictures do not have their Twitter photos added in place of the existing photo).\r\n\r\n25-Jun-2011 12:23 AM Mike Beasley:\r\nStill exists in beta 2.\r\n\r\n11-Jul-2011 11:08 PM Mike Beasley:\r\nResolved in beta 3. Additional twitter accounts are added to the contact card but do not replace user-added ones."
