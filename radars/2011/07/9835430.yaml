    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the standalone conversation window (the one that opens when you double-click a conversation header) there is no way to delete the entire conversation at once.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Switch to the \"classic layout\" and enable \"Organize by Conversation\".\r\n2. Open a conversation with more than one message.\r\n3. Press Delete/Shift-Delete/anything.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a way to delete the entire conversation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the currently selected message can be deleted. There seems to be no way (in the standalone conversation window) to select more than one message (\"Select > All Messages in this Conversation\" is grayed out)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInitially I was thinking there should be a separate menu item for this, but maybe enabling \"Select > All Messages...\" would be good enough for a two-step delete."
