    description: "Summary: Lion does not detect captive network after you have been booted from it\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to a captive network like Panera Bread\r\n2. See Lion correctly detect this and get you signed on\r\n3. Use said network for a while (usually an hour)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect that when I am booted off the network (which happens about every 1-2 hours on the local panera wifi) the captive network box comes up again\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, system acts like I have no internet connection till I open up a tab in Safari/Chrome and try to go to a web page and get the same captive network screen that came up when I first got onto the network.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
