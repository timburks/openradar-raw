    description: "21-Jul-2011 03:44 PM Anne McCreery:\r\nSummary: The default audit_control file included in /etc/security/ does not contain a 'host:' field as it should according to the man pages.  /var/log/system.log gets an error and the file cannot be read properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  Do 'su audit -s'.  Check /var/log/system.log.  Look for an error:\r\n\r\n        auditd[1450]: audit_control(5) may be missing 'host:' field\r\n\r\nAdditionally, changing any settings below where 'host:' should be (in particular the 'naflags:' field) does not yield changed results in audit trails.  Thus it seems the audit_control file is not getting read correctly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: audit_control(5) is read in its entirety and configures the auditing system correctly, and rotates the audit logs.\r\n\r\nActual Results: audit_control(5) is not read correctly and the audition system is not configured correctly, though the audit logs are rotated.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: This bug was found while attempting to configure the OS X audit system for performance benchmarking, as part of a survey of auditing systems on several platforms.  This research is being done by Benjamin Kuperman (advisor), Luke Lovett (student), and Isaac McCreery (student) at Oberlin College Computer Science as part of the Oberlin Summer Research Institute."
