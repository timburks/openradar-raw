    description: "Documentation for this function says:\r\n\r\ntarting at index 0, each element of the array is sent an isEqual: message until a match is found or the end of the array is reached. This method passes the anObject parameter to each isEqual: message. Objects are considered equal if isEqual: (declared in the NSObject protocol) returns YES.\r\n\r\nIt is as it worked on Mac OS X 10.0 -10.6, BUT on Mac OS X 10.7 it DON'T sends isEqual: message to array items at least if classes of anObject and array's item are different."
