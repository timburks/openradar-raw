    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn standard Cocoa webviews, if you use the standard \"look up\" service to define a word, the scrollbars (if present) disappear, scrolling is broken, all JavaScript no longer works, and the web page's style is affected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build and Run this app: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/55342/radar/NoCodeBrowser.zip (It's a trivial \"web browser\" app made with Interface Builder, no code. It simply has a webview and a textfield that is bound to the webview's takeStringURLFrom: action.)\r\n2. In the text field, enter this address: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/55342/radar/javascript_test.html\r\n3. Note that you can scroll the page, and click the \"Test JavaScript\" button to display the current date/time. Also note that the font of the text is Times.\r\n3. Select a word (such as \"JavaScript\"), right click, and select Look Up \"JavaScript.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDictionary popover appears, but the page is not affected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Dictionary popover appears.\r\n3. The scrollbars disappear.\r\n4. I am no longer able to scroll the page.\r\n4. The \"Test JavaScript\" button no longer works.\r\n5. The font of the web page changes from Times to Baskerville. (The same font as the one used in the Dictionary Popover.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDoesn't happen in 10.6.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPerhaps has something to do with the webview's page being overridden by code in the dictionary popover."
