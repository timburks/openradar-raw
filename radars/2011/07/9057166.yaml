    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUnder earlier releases of Mac OS X, the order of Spaces in the spaces overview was user customisable. Under this seed of Mac OS X 10.7, that is no longer so.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nActivate Mission Control with more than one space. Try dragging spaces around.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSpaces should reorder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDragging has no effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nMac OS X 10.7.2 appears to have introduced the ability to drag reorder spaces. Thanks, guys!\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
