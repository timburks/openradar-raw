    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTo replace MIT Kerberos with Heimdal, the MITKerberosShim was introduced. it layers the MIT and Kerberos Login APIs on Heimdal. Sadly, incompletely, but it logs when it doesn't implement something, and returns a dummy return code.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, a large number of those return codes are 0 (success), so an application links, runs, may believe it's doing things that succeed, and then crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ncall any of the manifold functions in dummy.c in MITKerberosShim which hardcode a 0 return\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nif they claim success, actually doing what they claim to do\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\na log message and no processing whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nworked in 10.6, since it was a real kerberos library that did something. basically any call that doesn't either return an error or do cleanup and thus not actually need to clean up since the setup function was also stubbed is now broken.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe list of functions in this file needs a comprehensive look to see what errors should be returned; 0 is returned in nearly all, and is a bad choice for most of those."
