    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nArabic words are broken when drawn with Core Text using the Justified text alignment (kCTJustifiedTextAlignment). Justified words in arabic seem to insert the tatweel character (unicode 0x0640) at the wrong height, breaking words.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse core text to display arabic text, using justified text alignment kCTJustifiedTextAlignment\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCorrectly justified text with unbroken words\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCorrectly justified text with broken words.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis was tested on 4.3.x as well as 5.0 beta 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/8XxT\r\n\r\nSample project demonstrating the word breakage. The most easily recognized broken word is the second to last word on the first line. The alif should be connected, but is disconnected due to the broken elongation with the tatweel character."
