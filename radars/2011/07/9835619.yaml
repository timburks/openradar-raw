    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you purchase a gift code from the iTunes Store, a large warning is displayed that the code can only be redeemed in the store it was purchased from. But nowhere on the page does it actually tell you what store you are currently purchasing it from. To find that information, you have to back out of the purchase process, which discards all your work, then check the flag bubble at the bottom of the iTunes Store page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start purchasing a gift code.\r\n2. Read the warning.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The warning includes the store you are purchasing from.\r\n4. The country flag identifying the store is also visible on the form page.\r\n5. These make it easy to confirm the purchase is from the correct store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Look everywhere for an indication of the store.\r\n4. Hit Back to go back to the main iTunes Store page.\r\n5. Scroll way down to the bottom of the page to find the flag bubble.\r\n6. Confirm you are in the store you intended to be in.\r\n7. Begin the gift code purchase process all over again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is especially frustrating when you are set to the U.S. store but the language is Spanish, as you worry that it might instead be the store for a Spanish-speaking country."
