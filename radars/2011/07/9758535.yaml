    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter updating to iOS 5 beta 3, I opened the Music app and was greeted by a popup informing me that videos had moved into their own app. Of course, if I had been using an iPhone, this would have made perfect sense to me. I was using an iPod touch, however. Videos have always been in their own separate app on the iPod touch, and starting off by telling users that they have moved (when in fact they have not) can be misleading and confusing for some. It would probably be best to limit this notification to users on iPhones. iPod touch and iPad users will not be concerned with this information since on the iPad the only change was to the label and icon of the Music app (previously iPod), and on the iPod touch nothing at all has changed."
