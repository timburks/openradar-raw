    description: "19-Jul-2011 02:06 PM Olivier Lacan:\r\nSummary: The App Store never remembers pagination or filter choices after drilling down to an app page and coming back to the app list view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n1- Open the App Store\r\n2- Go to any category\r\n3- Go to any page expect the first\r\n4- Sort by Release Date\r\n5- Drill down to an app detail page\r\n6- Hit the back button to come back to the list\r\n7- You'll find yourself on Page 1, with the default filter (instead of Release Date)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStep 7 should take user to previously browsed page and remember the filter setting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStep 7 instead confuses the user and forces him to find his place and reset the filter for his search. Effectively discouraging anything else than superficial browsing of the app catalog, likely discouraging sales.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: It would take a semi-capable web developer an afternoon to fix this. There's no conceptual design pattern to create here, it's an expected behavior for a half-decent website, and Apple can't even offer that experience to App Store users."
