    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe server configuration assistant allows a volume to be selected for service data that contains spaces in it's name. This configuration makes MySQL (at least) unusable. The tool should not allow an inoperable configuration to be created.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInstall OSX Server, and when prompted to chose a location for service data select a volume with a space in its name.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf the assistant allows a volume to be selected, the generated configuration will work.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nHaving selected a data drive with a space in its name, and then starting MySQL through Server Admin, the initial tablespace creation fails and the MySQL service enters an endless loop of trying to start up and failing. The service displays in Server Admin and through serveradmin(8) as \"STARTING\" and cannot be stopped. The only way (I could find) to recover from this situation is to manually use launchctl to disable the org.mysql.mysqld service.\r\n\r\nAccording to http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2201196 the problem is that the path to the MySQL data directory contains a space character. Once the service has been disabled as described above, updating the MySQL config to keep the data directory at /var/mysql and restarting the service through Server Admin allows the database to be correctly brought up.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
