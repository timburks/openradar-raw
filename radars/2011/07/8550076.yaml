    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n* handling of account email addresses is inconsistent between wiki server and OpenDirectory\r\n\r\n* wiki group emails are not delivered to an account holder unless they have entered an email address in their preferences page (even if an email address exists in OpenDirectory)\r\n\r\n* when account holders change their email address in their wiki preferences page, the update is not propagated back to their OpenDirectory account\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* enable the wiki server, and create several accounts in opendirectory that have email addresses defined.\r\n\r\n* add one of these accounts to the access list for a wiki and send an email to the group email address foo-wiki@example.com\r\n\r\n* log in with one of these accounts and set an email address in the user preferences page\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* the group email should be delivered to the address configured in OpenDirectory if no other address has been set in the account's wiki preferences page\r\n\r\n* when the user logs in and sets a preferred email address in their preferences page, the new email address will be propagated back to OpenDirectory for use by other OD client applications\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* unlike wiki invitation emails, messages sent to a group address (\"foo-wiki@example.com\") are not delevered to accounts with no preferred address set through the user preferences page in the wiki\r\n\r\n* setting an address in the preferences page does not propagate that change back to the OpenDirectory account, so other OD clients will not see the user's preferred email address\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* if either OD or wikid were authoritative for email addresses we could work around these issues, but as it stands there does not appear to be a single location where account email addresses can be managed and that all client applications will use."
