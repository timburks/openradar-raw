    description: "Summary: After migrating a user account from Snow Leopard to Lion (GM), Mail rebuilds the ~/Library/Mail folder, moving the Bundles folder in the process, which effectively disables any installed Mail plug-ins. As opposed to previous releases of Mac OS X it neither tells the users nor checks, which versions of the Mail.app and the Message.framework the plug-ins support.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a pre-Lion ~/Library/Mail folder, which containts plug-ins (i.e. bundles, such as http://lokiware.info/Attachment-Tamer ).\r\n\r\n2. Migrate the user account from Snow Leopard to Lion. (It suffices to copy the pre-Lion ~/Library/Mail folder and com.apple.mail.plist file to a Lion installation.)\r\n\r\n3. Launch Mail.app on the Lion installation and wait until it rebuilds the Mail folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMail should scan ~/Library/Mail/Bundles and check the SupportedPluginCompatibilityUUIDs key in their Info.plists. Then it should retain the plug-ins that support the current version of Mail.app and Message.framework, move the rest to a \"Bundles (Disabled)\" folder and tell the user about it--as it usually does when outdated plug-ins are detected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMail puts the whole ~/Library/Mail/Bundles folder either into ~/Library/Mail/Mail Lost+Found or ~/Library/Mail/Mail Lost+Found or into ~/Library/Mail/V2 (I do not remember anymore), without checking the plug-ins or informing the user. This way even the plug-ins that have been updated to support Lion are disabled. What's worse, Mail does not tell the user about it.\r\n\r\nRegression: --\r\n\r\nNotes: --"
