    description: "It would be great to be able to install an iOS app from \"Archives\" directly onto a device.\r\nCurrently, I've to do this tedious process:\r\n\r\n- context menu \"Show in Finder\"\r\n- show package contents\r\n- back to Xcode in switch to Devices tab in Organizer\r\n- drag the .ipa onto the device\r\n\r\nI've to do this 6 times in a row to install a beta app onto our testing devices.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to install directly from the context menu of an archived app.\r\nBonus point for the ability to install onto a selection of connected devices at once ;)"
