    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 4.1 installed via the Mac App Store for Lion does not allow the developer to select the install location. It also does not tell you what install location it is using.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Xcode 4.1 from the App Store.\r\n2. Open Install Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Installer.app opens.\r\n4. Select which components to install.\r\n5. Select where to install Xcode.\r\n6. Proceed with install.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Installer.app does not open.\r\n4. The Install Xcode application does not behave like a standard install package.\r\n5. The install begins without confirming the install location.\r\n6. The install begins without confirming the components to install.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll Xcode releases downloaded from the Developer website rather than the Mac App Store have used a standard Installer package that preserved the desired features. The bogus installer downloaded by the Mac App Store is a MAJOR step backwards in usability, as well as directly contradicting developer expectations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA side effect of the change from Installer.app to Install Xcode.app is that nothing is localized. It's all displayed in English, even though English is set as my fifth choice in the system language preferences."
