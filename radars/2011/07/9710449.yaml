    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nDevelopers currently have no way to contact users who leave a review in the App Store describing a problem/crash or possibly misunderstandings. Often developers have the need to get more information from the user about a specific problem or have the need to explain things as some problems often have a very simple solution. \r\nThis would not only help developers get in more direct interaction with the user, but also give users a better experience and a better feeling that their problems are taken seriously.\r\n\r\nWhen a user gets a reply on a review from the developer, this should also be made visible without the user having to explicitly look for it - on iOS 5 for example this could be done with a separate section in the notification center."
