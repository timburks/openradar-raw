    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using the open source HockeyKit to deploy beta versions with over the air (OTA) installation. When kicking off the OTA installation from Safari, the app appears as \"Waiting…\" on the home screen and stays in that state. Only after a reboot of the device, the download begins and the installation completes successfully.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true when starting an update from within the app using the HockeyClient component.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload and install the server component of HockeyKit and deploy an iOS app with it. Try to install that app from Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should install correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe download doesn't start and the Springboard just displays \"Waiting…\" below the app's icon. After a restart of the device, the download begins and the installation completes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt works fine on all iOS 4.x devices. I'm pretty sure this has nothing todo with HockeyKit. Of course, there might be some undocumented changes in iOS 5 that need to be reflected in HockeyKit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHockeyKit is available from: https://github.com/TheRealKerni/HockeyKit\r\nI've used the development branch, commit f86fd7 from 2011-06-24.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded 08-Jul-2011 04:25 PM:\r\nLet me add 2 notes:\r\n\r\n1. HockeyKit uses the standard OTA deployment described on http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009979\r\n\r\n2. The bug only occurs when using HTTP authentication.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 4.x, the login / password dialogs came up 2-times (I assume, once by Safari, once by Springboard).\r\nOn iOS 5.0 beta 2, the dialogs are displayed 3-times. After restart, it asks for the credentials once more but then downloads/installs."
