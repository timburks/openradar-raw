    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nDevelopers can't test their apps in iOS versions prior to the one that they have installed on their device(s).\r\n\r\nIt's extremely important for developers to be able to test on older iOS versions to make sure their app still works as expected. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a iOS App\r\n2. Decide to target a older iOS version\r\n3. Try to test their app on said iOS version\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's possible to test app in older iOS version. A possible implementation is that a developer can register a set of \"test device(s)\" that can install older iOS versions. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't test on older iOS versions. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nEvery time you want to test on a older iOS version."
