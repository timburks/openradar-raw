    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Mouse and Trackpad preference panes in System Preferences each have a setting that governs scrolling behavior:\r\n\r\n- In Mouse: \"Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating\"\r\n- In Trackpad: \"Scroll direction: natural / Content tracks finger movement\"\r\n\r\nHowever, enabling/disabling either setting affects both input devices. Additionally, setting the state of one setting does not update the state of the other setting, leading to one preference pane to contradict the current behavior of its device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect an external mouse to a notebook with a trackpad.\r\n2. Open System Preferences.\r\n3. Go to the Mouse preference pane.\r\n4. Uncheck \"Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating\"\r\n5. Note that both the mouse and trackpad have the pre-Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n6. Go to the Trackpad preference pane.\r\n7. Note that \"Scroll direction: natural\" is checked.\r\n8. Uncheck \"Scroll direction: natural\".\r\n9. Note that both the mouse and trackpad still have the pre-Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n10. Check \"Scroll direction: natural\".\r\n11. Note that both the mouse and trackpad have the default Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n12. Go to the Mouse preference pane.\r\n13. Note that \"Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating\" is still unchecked.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. The scrolling behavior settings for both the mouse and the trackpad should act independently:\r\n\r\n- If both settings in Mouse and Trackpad are checked, both the mouse and trackpad should have the default Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n- If both settings in Mouse and Trackpad are unchecked, both the mouse and trackpad should have the pre-Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n- If the setting in Mouse is unchecked but the setting in Trackpad is checked, the mouse should have the pre-Lion scrolling behavior and the trackpad should have the default Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n- If the setting in Mouse is checked but the setting in Trackpad is unchecked, the mouse should have the default Lion scrolling behavior and the trackpad should have the pre-Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n\r\n2. The settings under both preference panes should reflect the current scrolling behavior of the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- The scrolling behavior for both the mouse and the trackpad are affected by either setting:\r\n\r\n1. After an upgrade or clean installation to Lion, both the mouse and the trackpad have the default Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n2. If either setting is unchecked, both the mouse and the trackpad have the pre-Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n\r\n- The settings do not reflect the current state of the scrolling behavior for the device:\r\n\r\n1. If I uncheck the setting under one preference page, the setting under the other remains checked even though its device has the pre-Lion scrolling behavior.\r\n2. If I uncheck the incongruous setting in the second preference page and recheck it, the setting in the first preference pane remains unchecked even though its device has the default Lion behavior.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone; new feature in 10.7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
