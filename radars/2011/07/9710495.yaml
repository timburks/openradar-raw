    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCurrently if a user leaves a negative review about an app (eg because the user notices a bug, missing features) and those issues are fixed with updates of the application and the user continues to use the application, it is currently a decision of the user if he wants to correct his initially negative review into a more positive one. It would be nice if the OS would offer the user sort of a reminder for this. \r\nSay a user leaves a 1-star review for version 1.0 of an app, the app gets update once or twice and the user continues to use the app. It would be great if the OS would recognize this and ask the user if he maybe is now more pleased with the app than in the initial review."
