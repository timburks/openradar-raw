    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari Downloads window is missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Use new Safari 5.1\r\n2) Download a file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3) Downloads window opens, showing progress of multiple downloads which you can move off to the side and keep an eye on, for multiple files and progress/speed of each.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3) Teeny little popover obscures top right corner of Safari, cannot be moved away, does not remain persistently open while doing other things in Safari.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nKindly restore the downloads window. Even if it's in the Develop menu, though Window menu was a good place for it before.\r\n\r\nIf it interferes with full-screen browsing, maybe make it into a separate pseudo-tab like Top Sites or bookmarks? Then it could be torn off into its own window."
