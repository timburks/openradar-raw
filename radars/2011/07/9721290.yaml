    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presented with a \"Safe, Don't safe, cancel\" dialog Lion does not accept the command-D keyboard shortcut to activate \"don't save\" anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen any new document, for example in TextEdit.\r\nMake changes.\r\nClose the document without saving first.\r\nYou're presented with a \"cancel, Don't save, save\" dialog.\r\nPress command-D to activate \"don't save\" without having to reach for the mouse/trackpad.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDon't save should be activated. The document should be closed without saving.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly applies to applications that do not use Lion's new autosave feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis shortcut has been working since forever in classic Mac OS, even when it was still called \"System\"."
