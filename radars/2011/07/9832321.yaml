    description: "Summary:\r\nSince the update to 10.6.8, when I connect my MacBook Pro to run my 27\" iMac as an external display, the display runs at maximum brightness without any ability to change it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug MacBookPro6,2 into iMac11,1 with the mini-DVI cable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe brightness level should be the same setting last set on the MacBook Pro, and should be changable via the Displays prefs panel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBrightness is maximum. It cannot be changed, AFAICT.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis used to work as of 10.6.7."
