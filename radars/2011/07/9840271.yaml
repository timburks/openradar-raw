    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nBugs that were marked as requiring submitter attention, and later closed by Apple, remain in the Attention panel of bugreport.apple.com with no apparent way to get rid of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Report some bugs through the web interface\r\n\r\n* Wait a couple of major OS releases for them to be actioned :)\r\n\r\n* Don't get around to following up and marking them \"Resolved\" for a fortnight after receiving notification that they're finally fixed\r\n\r\n* Go to the \"Attention\" panel of bugreport.apple.com intending to mark as Resolved\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* Either the bugs no longer require my attention, or I can mark them as Resolved\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* Bugs appear in red on the Attention pane with a status of Closed. Attempting to mark them as Resolved displays an error dialog saying \r\n\r\nProblemID(s) 6330902, 6302741 are closed problems and “Resolved” can’t be applied.  Any problems that are Open have been marked as \"Resolved\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOf course I can just ignore them, but are they going to stay there for ever?"
