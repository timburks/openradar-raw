    description: "In the Finder's list view, folders can be expanded and collapsed using the arrow keys. An experienced user can drill through a folder hierarchy with extreme rapidity.  The new animations for this action are too slow, and make filesystem access feel sluggish. Especially, a user in the habit of going back up the heirarchy by repeatedly hitting the left arrow will be greatly slowed.\r\n\r\nWhile the animations are suitable and helpful, they should be more rapid, and should not block continued keyboard events from being processed. Compare these animations with those for the column view, which are much faster and do not impede the user.\r\n\r\nThe animations are fine for mouse access, since this cannot be done quickly anyway."
