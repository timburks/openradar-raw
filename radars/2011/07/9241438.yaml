    description: "06-Apr-2011 06:48 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe Scripting Bridge definition/header for System Events.app and the AppleScript library still show spacesRows and spacesColumns for the current Spaces setup, when this visual representation seems to hold no bearing under Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.\r\n\r\n15-May-2011 05:21 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nErr, things went from bad to worse here guys: the latest update (11A459e) has entirely removed the scripting bridge for Spaces! Erk!\r\n\r\n23-May-2011 08:56 AM Tony Arnold:\r\nHey guys, can I get an update on this issue please? \r\n\r\nI'm getting emails from irate users (why are end users getting access to Lion DPs?) asking why Hyperspaces doesn't work under Lion â€” they're accusing me of unfairly portraying my app in the app store because it says nothing about not working under Lion (which I've just assumed would be a violation of my NDA).\r\n\r\nKnowing if there will be any form of API for Mission Control/Spaces coming in Lion would make my life a lot easier. At least then I could make some decisions about the right thing to do by my users.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for the duped update, but I thought this might get closer to the team/devs that look after the original scripting APIs)\r\n\r\n25-May-2011 10:49 AM Tony Arnold:\r\nI'm updating the title of this bug to more accurately reflect it's contents."
