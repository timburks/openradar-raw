    description: "Summary:\r\nWe're continuously updating the accessibilityLabel of a custom view. After each update, we're posting a UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification. VO correctly speaks all the new accessibilityLabel values. However, if the updated accessibilityLabel is equal to the value when beginning the VO focus on the element, this updated value isn't spoken.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an app that changes the accessibilityLabel value every 5 seconds between the values \"one\", \"two\" and \"three\". Set the initial value (in -viewDidLoad or via NIB) to \"one\". Now enable VO (via 3* home button) and focus the element.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"one\", \"two\" and \"three\" should be spoken.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly \"two\" and \"three\" are spoken.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happens on an iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3.3.\r\nIt seems to be fixed on an iPad 2 running iOS 5.0 beta 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Jul-2011 04:32 PM Patrick Collins :\r\nEngineering has provided the following feedback regarding this issue:\r\n\r\nWe currently have not plans to release an update specific to iOS 4.3.3 if the issue doesn't occur in iOS 5.0x."
