    description: "Working with each developer preview builds of 10.7 Lion, it has become apparent that there is a need for a better GUI application for users to utilize when working with Kerberos. \r\n\r\nFor organizations such as mine, a national laboratory with a large investment in a Kerberos infrastructure, Ticket Viewer in 10.6 was a regression in functionality from Kerberos.app in 10.5. Ticket Viewer in 10.7 is yet another step backwards. Most end users are capable of using kinit from the command line interface to work with Kerberos, but for most working at the CLI is not as convenient as viewing a table-like interface and clicking buttons.\r\n\r\nTicket Viewer in 10.7 would ideally expose all of the functionality of kinit in the GUI. This would mean options such as requesting renewable tickets or the ability to destroy a ticket are buttons or menu items in the GUI. This would mean that most any action you could perform with kinit would be possible in Ticket Viewer.app.\r\n\r\nThank you for the consideration.\r\n\r\nSee also 9102012: Destroying a ticket in Ticket Viewer 2.0 also wipes out identity"
