    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Input status bar item has an option to show or hide the input source name; I prefer to keep it hidden. Since upgrading to Lion, the name sometimes comes back\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable the Input menu.\r\n2. Disable \"Show Input Source Name\". (If it is already disabled, toggle it to update the preference file.)\r\n3. Verify that com.apple.menuextra.textinput shows ModeNameVisible to be false.\r\n4. Restart (without logging out).\r\n5. Log in.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe input source name is not shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe input source name is shown.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis did not occur before upgrading from Snow Leopard (10.6.8) to Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Logging out first seems to save the preference correctly until the next log-in. (i.e. logging out and back in doesn't exhibit the error.)\r\n- Reproducible \"sometimes\" because I've had to force-shutdown by holding the power button in a freeze during log out, and it worked that time. But that's probably the same as above.\r\n- I have \"Show Input menu in login window\" turned on."
