    description: "16-Jul-2011 10:04 AM Jeff LaMarche:\r\nWhen replying to an e-mail from a .mac address, if the e-mail was address to foo@mac.com, the reply uses foo@me.com as the \"from\" address.\r\n\r\nWhile they are the same address, and I understand Apple wanting to encourage people to use the newer .me address, this causes serious problems with mailing lists that only allow members to post. As far as listserv's are concerned, foo@mac.com and foo@me.com are too completely different e-mail addresses, and if you signed up with foo@mac.com, an e-mail from foo@me.com will get rejected.\r\n\r\nThis means you have to manually remember to change the \"from\" e-mail account every time you reply to an e-mail, or unsubscribe and re-subscribe using @me.com. The former is a pain and results in a lot of rejected e-mails. The latter is also a pain in that you lose continuity.\r\n\r\nIf Apple had communicated that @mac.com was deprecated, this would be understandable, but all communication on this subject has been clear that @me.com was preferred, but that we could continue to use @mac.com indefinitely. If that hasn't changed, Mail.app's behavior in Lion really should.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Reply to an e-mail that's addressed to @mac.com\r\n2) Look at \"from\" drop down box\r\n3) Notice \"@me.com\" from address\r\n4) Mutter under your breath."
