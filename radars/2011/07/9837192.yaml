    description: "The XPC framework introduced in Lion is a handy way to isolate pieces of the application from each other. This is beneficial for security reasons, but equally as important, it keeps components of the application insulated from each other such that a crash in one will not necessarily crash the entire app. Furthermore, the availability of the framework on one platform causes code portability problems when trying to make a Mac code base work on iOS. \r\n\r\nThe service-oriented architecture of XPC would be invaluable on iOS, because it would help keep app data secure, would help keep apps more stable, and would make code portability between platforms easier."
