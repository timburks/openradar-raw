    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI manage iOS devices for a school and want to use Lion Server to manage them. As it stands, I can't prevent pupils from removing their devices from MDM control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enroll a device in Lion Server's Profile Manager.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected that there would be a way to prevent removal of the enrolment profile without authorisation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo such control exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAlso true in current releases.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI manage 110 iPads in a 1:1 deployment at the school I work in. The iPads are owned by the school. If pupils can simply remove their enrolment profile, the device then becomes unmanaged and we have a problem.\r\n\r\nI understand that, in general, enrolling in MDM is something that should be under a user's control but there are circumstances where the institution needs this level of control over a device."
