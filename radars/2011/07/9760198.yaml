    description: "The search options for project wide or file wide search are pretty much hidden by default. If you want to edit them, you have to click the magnifying glass and select to show them from the context menu that pops-up. Especially in project wide search, these options take quite a lot space in the sidebar, so I usually prefer to hide them. \r\n\r\nProblem: If I ever altered the search to be case sensitive or regular expression, I may not remember that in two hours or the next working day. I start a global search and get no hits, thinking I searched for the wrong term I modify over and over until I finally think about the hidden search options. This is pretty bad from a usability point of view. It would be better if at least the top three search options were somehow \"indicated\" without having to reveal the big options block first. It would be already enough if there were three letters next to the text field, like T for Text Search and R for Regex Search, C for case sensitive and I for case insensitive and so on. Icons would work as well."
