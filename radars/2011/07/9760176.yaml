    description: When an Obj-C method call, which takes a Block as an argument (e.g. enumerateObjectsUsingBlock), is autocompleted, the Block signature is a single "autocomplete item", e.g. "^(id obj, NSUInteger index, BOOL *stop)". When focused, a single keystroke removes the whole signature. There is neither a way to get exactly what is written there as text (which is the correct value to be used there), nor is there a way to only focus a single sub-element and only change that sub-element. So I have to re-type exactly what has already been written there before, since there is no way to turn the autocomplete suggestion into real text. It is pretty annoying that Xcode writes something for me, that would be the correct text to use, and then I have to re-type exactly the same thing because it goes away as soon as I make a keystroke.
