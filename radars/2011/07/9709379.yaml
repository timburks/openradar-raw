    description: "Summary:\r\nWith no easy way to clear app badge counts, the purpose of clearing notifications from Notification Center is basically defeated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Get a push notification\r\n2) Bring up Notification Center\r\n3) Tap the X, then \"clear\" to clear notifications from a specific app\r\n4) Check the app's badge count\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe badge count should be cleared since the notifications were dismissed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe badge count is unchanged\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to defeat the entire purpose of having a clear button. If I cleared a notification out of Notification Center, it is because I did not think it was important enough to keep around. If it was not important to keep in Notification Center, which is not always on the screen, I find it quite irritating that I still have to look at the badge every time I see the icon on my home screen. This is especially true of things like Facebook messages or Twitter mentions that I have seen already on my computer. Dismissing the notifications through Notification Center should also remove the badge count from the icon.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this setup would be ideal. For others, maybe not. The best option would be to make it a setting in the Notifications preference pane."
