    description: The "Chose a template for your new file" dialog does not recognize double clicks being sent there by an helper application. You can of course double click by clicking the left mouse button twice, but a lot of tools (e.g. drivers from Logitech, Microsoft, US Overdrive) allow you to define a mouse button to always act as a double click, even when just being clicked once. Those double clicks are treated like single clicks within that dialog, however, they work fine as double click everywhere else in the system.
