    description: "25-Jul-2011 01:11 PM Greg Pierce:\r\n'Directory Utility.jpg' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n25-Jul-2011 01:11 PM Greg Pierce:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nLocal domains registered with Directory Services under /Local/Default/Hosts are no longer recognized by Safari. These host domains worked fine in prior versions of Safari (<5.1) and continue to work fine in Firefox, Chrome and other browsers.  When one of these domains is accessed in Safari, it now spins and spins and loading activity monitor, and never loads any content.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Register a 127.0.0.1 local domain under /Local/Default/Hosts in the Directory Utility, or via dscl command line tool (see attachment for sample):\r\n\r\n/usr/bin/dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Hosts/devsetup.local IPAddress 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n2) Open Safari, attempt to load \"devsetup.local\"\r\n\r\n3) Watch the never ending load indicator.\r\n\r\n4) Open Firefox/Chrome, load \"devsetup.local\" -- see your local Apache \"It Works\" page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSafari will recognize the 127.0.0.1 local host and make a request to Web Sharing/Apache on the localhost.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSame settings worked in all prior versions of Safari."
