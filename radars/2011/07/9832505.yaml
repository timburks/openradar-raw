    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari's newsfeed reader view, the number of unread (\"New\") articles is shown on the page. However, clicking on already-read articles still decreases the \"New\" count.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a newsfeed with at least two unread items.\r\n2. Observe the number of \"New\" items in the top right corner of the page.\r\n3. Click on the first unread item *twice*.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe number of \"New\" items decreases by one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe number of \"New\" items decreases by two. If you keep clicking on items that have already been read, the number of \"New\" items will continue to decrease. (The number shown in Safari's bookmarks bar will be correct, however.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAFAIK, this has never been correct since the newsfeed reader was introduced."
