    description: In Xcode3 the file name of the currently opened source file was in the title bar. By clicking the icon, keeping the button pressed for a couple of seconds, it was possible to "pick" this file and drag it somewhere else. E.g. to a Terminal window, where the path to this file was pasted. This is still possible with Xcode4, but only if you currently have a source file opened that does not belong to a project. If you have a project opened and edit a source file, only the project can be dragged and dropped that way somewhere else, not the file you are currently editing. The file name does appear in the title bar of the window, but only next to the project name and there is nowhere another way how I could "pick" up this file, other than revealing it in Group Tree or Finder and dragging it from there.
