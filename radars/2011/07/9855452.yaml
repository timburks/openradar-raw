    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen launching Instruments in some Xcode 4.1 installations (including mine) it hangs after having selected a trace type. The problem (including a workaround) is described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6801310/problem-with-starting-instruments-via-profile-under-xcode-4-1-build-4b110\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Load a project in Xcode\r\n- Choose \"Profile\" (cmd-i)\r\n- Select a trace type (e. g. \"Leaks\")\r\n- Click \"Profile\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstruments starts profiling the running App.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstruments stops responding. The timer is running but no data is being displayed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem always occurs in my Xcode/Instruments installation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Go back to Xcode and use Cmd-Tab to switch to Instruments. I have to that twice to get Instruments running again."
