    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen loading a flash component in a page in Safari 5.1 on a Mac, the HTTP_REFERER header is not passed and hence it's impossible to do any checking on source domain and logic associated with it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the web inspector\r\nGo to an page with an embeded flash element (e.g. http://vzaartest.blogspot.com/2011/07/png-test.html )\r\nCheck non flash elements, the HTTP_REFERER header is shown as the page url location\r\nCheck the flash elements, their is no HTTP_REFERER header\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAnd HTTP_REFERER header with the page url location\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo HTTP_REFERER header\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUse an earlier version of Safari (e.g. 4) on Mac\r\nUse Safari 5.1 on Windows\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nYou can see the missing header information in the screen shot.  I can confirm this on other sites running flash as well. \r\n\r\nI've also confirmed this using charles proxy and other header inspection programs."
