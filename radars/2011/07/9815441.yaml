    description: "Summary: Safari for Mac since the 5th version (which was released on the 2010 WWDC) has support for extensions which allow the user customize their experience with the navigator and add other features like, for example shortening a url straight from the browser or for example to create a \"live\" bookmark folder (a RSS feed or something)\r\n\r\nI'd be great both for the enduser and for the developer to have support for the extensions in the MobileSafari like Safari does."
