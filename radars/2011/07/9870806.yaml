    description: "Summary:\r\nI think it's time for a search bar in the iTunes app listing, with a dynamic update in the listing below.\r\n\r\nPeople have more and more apps on their iDevices. And every time I'm looking for an app in my Library in iTunes I have to switch from 'Kind' to 'Name', otherwise it's impossible to find the app. I might have more apps (214) than 'Joe Average', but then he might not know how to sort on Name either.\r\n\r\nIt might also help to *remember* the preferred sort order of the user."
