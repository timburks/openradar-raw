    description: "In Mac OS X 10.6 and earlier (don't know how much earlier), you would use opt-[a sound volume up or down key] for Sound Preferences, shift-volume to invert the \"Play feedback when volume is changed\" setting, and opt-shift-volume to change sound volume in small increments (about a quarter of a square in the bezel that comes up).\r\n\r\nThis was very handy, as even just one square would represent a volume that is a bit too loud on a MacBook Pro's speakers, for example.\r\n\r\nIn 10.7, this feature is just gone, and nothing happens when I press opt-shift-[volume keys]. Please bring this feature back!"
