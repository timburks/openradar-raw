Attached image shows it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall Mac OS X Lion 10.7 Build 11A511 on a Macbook Air Model 2,1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo Kernel Panic.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKernel Panic.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nInstall the Lion Update App while running in 10.7 DP4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI was updating from Lion 10.7 DP4. Reinstalled that over the existing installation, the Mac booted again. Then started the GM installer (freshly downloaded) again, after the reboot the panic appeared again.\r\nAfter setting up a usb stick with the installer image and installing 10.7 Build 11A511 by booting from the usb stick, it finally works."
