    description: "Abstract:\r\n\r\nODB is an Apple Events based interface for applications to share documents. See http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/odbsuite.html for specifications and details. It is commonly used by nearly all text editors and FTP clients on the platform to allow integration of both. I.e. letting the editor edit a file that is up-/downloaded by the ftp client.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n\r\nRight now, with sandboxing in place ODB only works with the com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events entitlement in place. \r\n\r\nOnce that temporary exception will be repelled, ODB will cease to work on the platform to the dismay of many users and developers."
