    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApple's Enhanced Podcast Format is not documented.\r\nChapterTool, the viable tool for podcast producers not using Garageband, is outdated and worst of all, PowerPC only. Which means it will likely cease to work with Lion.\r\n\r\nPlease either release an update version of ChapterTool (or its source), or document the format used, specifically the two text tracks used for chapters and links and the track used for images. It's a travesty that developers and content producers that want to support rich audio with iTunes and on iOS have to rely on reverse engineering.\r\n\r\n(Duplicate of rdar://9488225)"
