    description: "Summary:\r\nFor normal attributes and one-to-one relationships you get a\r\n\"-validate<Key>:error:\" when you ask CoreData for the implementations\r\nof the accessors, however on a (one/many)-to-many relationship you only get\r\n\"-add<Key>sObject:\" and \"-remove<Key>sObject:\". \r\nThis makes it pretty much impossible to validate newly added/removed relationships.\r\n\r\nTo allow entities to refuse relationships to certain managed objects based on defined conditions one needs an equivalent of \"-validate<Key>:error:\" for to-many relationships.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave an entity Foo with a to-many relationships with managed objects whose property self.foobar is required to be equal to @\"bar\" when added in order to be allowed a relationship with Foo. Or just about any other condition.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere exist two additional validation methods for use prior to addition and removal of managed objects from a to-many relationship.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere exist no such methods.\r\nApparently the only currently available solution is to either have them fail silently in \"-add<Key>sObject:\" and \"-remove<Key>sObject:\".\r\nOr to re-validate every single relationship in \"-validate<Key>:error:\" one at a time. Out of potentially 100.000+. Big waste of CPU cycles, memory (thousands of avoidable faults) and last but not least brain work.\r\nFurther more there's no straight-forward way to at that time find out which element was changed and whether it was removed or added.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFound a 6 year old osx dev mailing list post by Karl Adam from 2005 asking for the very same thing: http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/143948-validating-new-entity-in-one-to-many-relationships-in-core-data.html\r\nUnfortunately he didn't file a report back then."
