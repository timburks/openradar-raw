    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing MobileMe push email, the unread counter on my iPhone continues to display unread messages when the messages have been read on the webmail interface or on a Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wait until unread mail arrives in your mailbox\r\n2. Note that the iPhone badges its mail app with the unread count\r\n3. Read the mail on a Mac using mail.app connected via IMAP\r\n4. Check whether iPhone mail app still shows a badge\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niphone mail app does not show any unread messages\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf using Push email, the unread count remains\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression, since when using standard pull email then the unread count will disappear the next time the iPhone checks for email.\r\n\r\nWhen using Push, the only way to be rid of the unread count is to manually check for email. It will never automatically go away like it should."
