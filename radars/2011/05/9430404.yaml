    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI needed to move a carefully laid out set of items from one view to another view of identical size.  This (originally) was going to be easier than resetting connections and whatnot to remove an extraneous outer view.\r\n\r\nWhen I moved the items, IB centered all of them, destroying my layout.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nMake two views, peers in a window, the same size\r\n\r\nArrange some UI Buttons tastefully in one of the view.\r\n\r\nSelect the buttons and drag them into the view\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe buttons maintain their relative distances\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nEach button is centered, one on top of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n  Happens in Xcode 4.0 and 4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached ( http://http://t.co/WbNl8mq ) is a screen movie that shows what I see"
