    description: "10-May-2011 04:35 PM Neven Mrgan:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWith a large number of apps, pages, and folders, It can be difficult to locate which folder an app is in. Spotlighting the app lets you launch it, but doesn't tell you what folder it's in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch for an app name in Spotlight.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe row in the result list should show the app name on the left, and perhaps on the right, the folder name in gray."
