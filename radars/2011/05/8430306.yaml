    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\nType a line of code into Xcode including :(, such as:\r\n\r\n- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;\r\n\r\nHave Xcode speak this line. I believe :( is by default pronounced as \"frown\" in all applications.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nVoiceOver will pronounce those characters as \"frown\" instead of the expected \"colon open paren\".\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nBy adding an additional pronunciation for \":(\" specific to Xcode, we are able to make it pronounce as intended, but it would be much more intuitive to allow the first rule to be for all applications except for Xcode. He was not unable to figure this out without the assistance of a sighted user.\r\n\r\n16-May-2011 08:10 PM William LaFrance:\r\nThis issue still remains. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, the request was that in the App-selection dropdown (screenshot attached) in VoiceOver Utility would allow apps to be listed as exceptions (\"all except these apps\") instead of rules. For example, you would want:\r\n\r\n\"Hello! :)\" to be read as \"Hello! smile\"\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\n\"- (void) doSomething:(id someObject);\" to be read as \"minus open paren void close paren do something colon open paren id some object close paren semicolon\"."
