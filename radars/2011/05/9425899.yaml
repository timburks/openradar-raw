    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is currently no way to create a smart group in Address Book that filters out cards that have marked as a Company or as a Person. You can filter on the contents of the company field but that doesn't define if the card is a Person or Company.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a new \"Smart Group\"\r\n2) Select \"Card\" from the first condition popup\r\n3) Notice no \"is Company\" or no \"is Person\" option.\r\n4) Bang head on desk\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOptions to filter out cards that are companies or people. eg. \"is Company\" and \"is Person\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMissing filtering options.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested in 10.6.7 / Build 10J869"
