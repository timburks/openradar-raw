    description: "Summary: The Address Book application is now called \"Adresář\" in the Czech localization. \"Adresář\" is used to translate the English word \"(filesystem) directory\", so it it may cause confusion.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: \"Adresář\" is a certainly a correct translation of \"address book\", and so in this regard it is better than the name \"Seznam Adres\" (literally \"list of addresses\") used in the previous localizations. The most choice would probably be to name the application \"Kontakty\" (\"Contacts\"). This is universally comprehensible (and likely more frequent word than \"adresář\", yet not too informal) and unambiguous. (The Portuguese [pt_PT] localization chose this approach and calls Address Book \"Contactos\".)"
