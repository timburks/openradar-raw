    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Mac is still the best platform to develop software on.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the Mac App Store was released (and Xcode moved to App Store/Paid Developer Account distribution), an extra barrier has been put in place that stops people from setting up their system for development. To do development (not just Cocoa/Objective-C work), a compiler is usually required, and the easiest way to set this up has always been to download and install Xcode.\r\n\r\nI would like to remove the \"pay for Xcode\" barrier by being able to \"Gift\" the app to people who for whatever reason aren't able to / are unwilling to pay. \r\n\r\nThe more developers we have, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGo to the Mac App Store. Search for an App. Look for a \"Gift this app to a friend\" button. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nGo to the Mac App Store. Search for an App. Click the \"Gift this app to a friend\" button. Enter the friend's email address. Pay/confirm payment for the app. App is then available for friend to download/install.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUnable to find \"Gift this app to a friend\" button.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nXcode used to be available for any developer who had signed up for a free developer account, but now requires either a paid developer account, or payment through the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf this was available I would set up a website that would connect people who a) were willing to buy other users Xcode b) were unable to buy Xcode but wanted to become a developer."
