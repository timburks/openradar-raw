    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe UIActionSheet does not provide a mechanism to customize the accessibility labels of the options in the sheet.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would have expected UIActionSheet to implement the UIAccessibilityContainer protocol which would have allowed the developer to easily customize the attributes of individual elements.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNot sure, but I assume the same applies to iOS versions prior to 4.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe current workaround I use is: https://gist.github.com/953326"
