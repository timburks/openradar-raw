Select any UI Element, you should see corresponding informations on the right utility sidebar. Select another file and then go back to the NIB. The UI element is deselected (while still \"grey/blue\" leading the user to think it's selected).\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have multiple windows, one of a nib file with a ui element selected and one with the project navigator and code, if you navigate between files on the code window, the UI element gets deselected on the NIB window. Reselecting it won't work, you need to *go back* to the project navigator, select your NIB file, and then you can select you're UI element..."
