    description: "I can't uninstall the iOS 4.1 Library and the iPhone OS 4.0 Library. The minus button is inactive.\r\n\r\nThis is very bad because for every search I get 3 identical results. Also, it feels like the search functionality is VERY slow because of the number of doc sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n2012-01-10, Apple:\r\nWe are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue and will continue to track it."
