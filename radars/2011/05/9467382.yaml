    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is possible for any application to mess with the network settings without requiring the user to enter an administrator password thanks to the SCPreferencesCreateWithAuthorization function from the SystemConfiguration framework.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse SCPreferencesCreateWithAuthorization and SCPreferencesLock to acquire a lock on the configuration preferences.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn administrator password is asked, regardless of the \"Require an administrator password to access system preferences with lock icons\" setting of the Security/General preference pane.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo password is asked, a lock on the configuration preferences is acquired and from there the application can do anything to the network preferences such as modifying the DNS servers.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem exists in Mac OS X 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease find more explanations along with sample code in \"Leopard's open invitation to malware developers\" forum post: http://www.afp548.com/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=29&showtopic=18982\r\n\r\nThis issue was also discussed on the Macintosh Network Programming mailing list back in 2007.\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/macnetworkprog/2007/Dec/msg00043.html\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/macnetworkprog/2008/Jan/msg00000.html"
