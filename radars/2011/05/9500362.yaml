    description: "Summary:\r\nUITableView and UIScrollView have limited abilities to present huge lists of data. The standard grid view component would much improve user experience and development efforts.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew UIGridView, UIGridViewItem and UIGridViewController classes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no such classes at all.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe need an officially supported component similar to AQGridView by Alan Quatermain: https://github.com/AlanQuatermain/AQGridView"
