    description: "When composing an email, each To/CC/BCC recipient has a pop-up menu with several options. Noticeably absent is the ability to remove the address from Previous Recipients. Currently, this can only be accessed from the Window menu, and many people I know are completely unaware of its existence.\r\n\r\nTo wit, my wife was recently utterly frustrated that an address she mis-typed on a sent email always pops up when she tries to type the correct one. I showed her how to remove a previous recipient, which solves the immediate problem, but it's still a convoluted process to the average user. (Not only do you have to know where to find the window, but you have to search for the address again to remove it.)\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to have a \"Forget this address\" option in the menu so it's immediately accessible to users."
