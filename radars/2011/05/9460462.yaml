    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUse of the system-provided In-App Purchase API opens developers to patent infringement lawsuits from patent troll Lodsys, who are demanding licensing fees above and beyond Appleâ€™s 30% cut.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Ship an app that uses the In-App Purchase API\r\n2. Wait to be contacted by Lodsys\r\n3a. Pay Lodsys, and every patent troll that inevitably follows them\r\n3b. Be sued out of existence\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApple steps in using their nearly infinite financial and legal resources to protect their developer ecosystem, removing the threat of Lodsys, and ultimately pushing for reform of our broken patent system.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApple remains quiet, while their developer community privately and publicly freaks out.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDozens of developers, including James Thomson and Apple Design Award winner Iconfactory, have already been targeted by Lodsys.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSome reassurance from Apple would be nice.\r\nAlso see: http://mur.mu.rs/?p=134 and http://mur.mu.rs/?p=139\r\n#unlodsys"
