    description: "I have two Macs. On the first Mac, I create a project that references e.g. the Sparkle framework (http://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle). Here's a screen recording of what I do:\r\n\r\n\thttp://masters-of-the-void.com/jury1/index.html\r\n\r\n(Note that I can not use the \"+\" button to add Sparkle to the Copy Files build phase, because it won't let me select any frameworks) Then I check this into Git, which removes the xcuserdata folder, and check it out on a second Mac. There, I try to build:\r\n\r\n\thttp://masters-of-the-void.com/jury2/index.html\r\n\r\nNow, it seems instead of referencing the build product of the framework target, Xcode actually references the item by path. Which means that on the second Mac, which builds into the default ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/... instead of into a \"build\" folder in the project directory, it isn't able to find the file.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this was the same with Xcode 3, and I don't think I ever changed the default location in Xcode 3 (whereas in Xcode 4 it got changed for me, and I only reset one of my Macs to a more sensible location).\r\n\r\nI would prefer not to have to force everyone who checks out my projects to change their build folder to make things work."
