    description: "The operation couldn’t be completed. No such file or directory\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI installed a new hard drive in my Macbook Pro, and after restoring my system from a time machine backup, xcode could no longer create IPA files from an xcarchive. Deleting my /Developer directory and reinstalling Xcode fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an iOS xcode project configured for app store or enterprise distribution. Confirm that you can generate an IPA file from an xcarchive of the project in the xcode organizer.\r\n2. Backup the system to Time Machine\r\n3. Erase the hard drive\r\n4. Re install Snow Leopard\r\n5. Use migration assistant to restore the system from the time machine backup created in step 2\r\n6. Apply all Software updates up to Mac OS X 10.6.7 (not sure if this step is required, but this is part of what I did)\r\n7. Open the project from step 1 in xcode\r\n8. Open the Xcode organizer\r\n9. Select the \"Archives\" tab\r\n10. select the archive that was created in step 1\r\n11. click \"share\"\r\n12. click \"next\"\r\n13. click \"save\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAn valid IPA file should be saved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode fails to generate the IPA. A sheet appears with the message \"The operation couldn’t be completed. No such file or directory.\"\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot of the error message (Identical to http://i.imgur.com/SZnGY.png)\r\n\r\nRe archiving the project does not solve the problem. The only solution is to reinstall xcode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
