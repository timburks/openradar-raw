    description: "Summary:\r\nTabs in Xcode 4 do not behave like IDE or browser tabs\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Select file A from project navigator, it opens in current tab. Correct.\r\n2. Open a new tab, does not start blank, opens with file A. Weird, probably wrong.\r\n3. Select file B from project navigator, it opens in current tab. Correct.\r\n4. Select file A from project navigator, it opens in current tab, instead of switching back to tab A. WRONG.\r\n5. Close current document, observe that it also closed in tab A. WRONG.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA tab in other IDEs is a unique representation for an open file; in Objective-C, they should probably let you switch between .m and .h, but should never open another file in the same tab. Instead, if you're in tabbed view, every new file should be in its own tab, and manipulating one tab should not affect other tabs.\r\n\r\nIn web browsers, tabs can open duplicate views of the same site, but what you do in one has no effect on the other; closing a document should not close another tab's document.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is extremely surprising at almost every action.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
