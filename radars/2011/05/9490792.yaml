    description: "Summary: Using a factory-unlocked iPhone 4 (MC605C) on a carrier (T-Mobile USA) that uses the default \"Carrier 10.0\" configuration, FaceTime will not activate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Settings > Phone > FaceTime: ON\r\n\r\nExpected Results: SMS sent to default PhoneNumberRegistrationGatewayAddress of +44 7786 205094; FaceTime activating and being available when in Wi-Fi range\r\n\r\nActual Results: \"Waiting for activation...\". No SMS activity seen on carrier's website. FaceTime remains unavailable.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown. There are unconfirmed online reports that FaceTime activation on T-Mobile using unlocked iPhones purchased in Canada worked in previous iOS releases.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe phone does warn that my carrier may charge for SMS messages required to activate FaceTime.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the iPhone were able to configure FaceTime using an AppleID instead of (or in addition to) the phone number that would be an acceptable solution (since it would not require carrier configuration or SMS exchanges)."
