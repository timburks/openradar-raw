    description: "Summary: The standard system-wide cmd-N keyboard shortcut for \"New Folder\" does not work in Save and Save-before-Closing dialogs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a new document in Preview or TextEdit. Choose File >Â Save. Expand the dialog window so that the \"New Folder\" button is visible. Press cmd-N.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A new folder should be created in the currently displayed folder (a dialog allowing the user to name the folder should appear).\r\n\r\nActual Results: In TextEdit, nothing happens. In Preview a new image from clipboard is created.\r\n\r\nRegression: I have tried it with Preview and TextEdit and preferred language set to English and Czech. Other system settings were set to their default state as far as I know.\r\n\r\nNotes: I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it's certainly annoying for any long-time Mac users that are used to this system-wide shortcut."
