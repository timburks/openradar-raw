    description: "The clock() function is documented in its man page as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The clock() function determines the amount of processor time used since the invocation of the calling process, measured in CLOCKS_PER_SECs of a second.\"\r\n\r\nIn a \"Standards\" note, it says:\r\n\r\n\"The clock() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (``ISO C90'').  However, Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification (``SUSv2'') requires CLOCKS_PER_SEC to be defined as one million.  FreeBSD does not conform to this requirement; changing the value would introduce binary incompatibility and one million is still inadequate on modern processors.\"\r\n\r\nMac OS X does in fact set CLOCKS_PER_SEC to one million, making clock() useless for actually timing anything. The man page implies (albeit weakly) that OS X follows the FreeBSD convention, not the SUSv2.\r\n\r\nThe man page should be updated to make this limitation clearer (that clock() time can't be translated to seconds), and possibly suggest an alternative way of measuring elapsed time that is still monotonic."
