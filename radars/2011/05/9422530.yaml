    description: "11-May-2011 01:12 PM Sailesh Agrawal:\r\n'childWindow.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-May-2011 01:12 PM Sailesh Agrawal:\r\nSummary: Moving a window to another spaces causes all windows that have child windows to move to that space too. This only happens if the window is moved in Spaces view (F8). It doesn't happen if the window is moved to another space by dragging to the edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create Window A\r\n2. Create Window B and attach a child window\r\n3. Enter Spaces view (F8)\r\n4. Move Window A to Space 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt this point Window A should be on Space 1 and Window B should be on Space 2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth Window A and Window B are on Space 2\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is not a regression. I tested on 10.5.8 and 10.5.1 and it happens in both. This doesn't happen on 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a sample app to demonstrate.\r\n\r\nThis bug is causing problems for Google Chrome users running on 10.5."
