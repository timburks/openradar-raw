    description: "11-Mar-2011 03:36 PM Levi Brown:\r\nSummary: There appears to be no support for .json (JSON) file types in the XCode 4 editor, which defaults to Plain Text as the file type.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open a .json file in XCode 4\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Proper JSON syntax hilighting, indentation, validation, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Simply treated as plain text.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are some pretty obscure file types supported by XCode 4, yet the web standard for JSON is not supported seems like a blatant oversight."
