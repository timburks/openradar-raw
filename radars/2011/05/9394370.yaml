    description: "Summary:\r\nThe button to download updates individually does not work on iOS 3.1.3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload an app from the App Store.\r\nWait for the developer to update the app.\r\nOpen the “App Store” application and switch to the Updates tab. \r\nTap on an available update. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blue button to download the update is clickable. When clicked, it prompts for the iTunes account’s password and downloads the update.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens when the blue button is clicked. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the layout is incorrect. The corners of the app’s icon are not rounded. There is an odd drop shadow under the icon. The background of the changelog is lighter than the rest of the page’s background. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested on iOS 3.1.3, first generation iPod touch.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: The user uses iTunes to update the apps.\r\n\r\nSee screenshot. The blue button marked “Free” in the update page is not clickable. \r\n\r\n(link to said screenshot for openradar: http://cl.ly/2a1V36273c3r0n1Z3F1v )\r\n12-May-2011 03:04 PM Patrick Collins :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nDoes this issue also occur with iOS 4.2.1 GM or iOS 4.3.3 GM (8J2)?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether or not you continue to experience this issue with the newly released software by updating this bug report.\r\n24-May-2011 08:58 PM :\r\nPatrick,\r\n\r\nOn an original iPhone or iPod touch, the highest operating system allowed is 3.1.3. That is where the problem happens — users stuck on the old OS can’t update apps individually without iTunes. The new operating systems (on newer hardware) are fine; they’re not a part of this bug. \r\n\r\nKevin"
