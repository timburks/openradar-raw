    description: "23-May-2011 12:03 PM Eric Wing:\r\n'AU3DMixer_MemoryLeak.trace.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n23-May-2011 12:03 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere appears to be a memory leak inside the Apple library \"Audio Toolbox\". When I create a new OpenAL context, Instruments (Leaks) is reporting a leak in \r\nAU3DMixerEmbeddedInputElement::Initialize()\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWe run our program using OpenAL with Leaks. We see shortly after OpenAL is loaded, a single leak appears in \r\nAU3DMixerEmbeddedInputElement::Initialize()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no leak reported.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a leak reported.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUntested\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a debug binary for iOS which I ran to produce the also attached Instruments trace.\r\nIf you want access to the OpenAL code I use, the library is ALmixer which is open source and available here:\r\nhttp://playcontrol.net/opensource/ALmixer"
