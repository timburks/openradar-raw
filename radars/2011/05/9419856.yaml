    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen doing a fine and replace, where the searched for text contains a newline followed by some characters and the replacement text doesn't contain a newline, Xcode crashes\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open test.m in Xcode (in the attached archive)\r\n2. Start a find & replace\r\n3. Set the find to ';\r\n@synthesize' (without the quotes)\r\n4. Set the replace to ',' (again, without the quotes)\r\n5. Click Replace All (make sure all your work is saved before this step)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode replaces all the @synthesize _; statements with a single comma separated one\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode throws a tantrum, soils its nappy and calls for mummy (crash log is in the attached archive)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf you include a newline in the replace string, or if you don't have any characters after the newline, it doesn't crash.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile the assertion failure dialogue appears, Xcode exits soon after, of its own accord."
