    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode does not support static frameworks out of the box, even though it's an incredibly useful feature.\r\n\r\nI've created a universal framework template for iOS here: https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework\r\n\r\nIt works fine, but it requires modification to Xcode's files, which leaves it a fragile solution.\r\n\r\nI can understand that adding full-fledged universal framework support to Xcode is a bit of work, but if you could simply add com.apple.product-type.framework.static into the iPhone and Simulator specifications, which, since they are not directly exposed to the end user, will not cause confusion, the templates on github would work great as a stopgap measure.\r\n\r\nI'm including the patch file that I apply to the specifications directories currently. They do not allow for dynamic frameworks, but I can submit a version that does if needed."
