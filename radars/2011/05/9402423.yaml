    description: "I think the static analyzer should show warnings about calls to dealloc, that aren't [super dealloc] from the subclass' -dealloc method. \r\n\r\nFor example the following should obviously never occur under Objective-C memory management rules:\r\n\r\n- (void)dealloc {\r\n    [foo dealloc];\r\n    [super dealloc];\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe analyzer should warn about this so we can correct it to:\r\n\r\n- (void)dealloc {\r\n    [foo release];\r\n    [super dealloc];\r\n}\r\n\r\nAfter spending a while tracking down a crash, caused by mistakingly calling dealloc instead of release, this ability would greatly improve the debugging of such cases in apps, and make some much more stable."
