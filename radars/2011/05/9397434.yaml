    description: "Summary:\r\nMac OS X needs a API to let developers find out whether a given disk is spun up\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• write an app that needs to know whether a given disk is currently spun up or sleeping\r\n• find out that there is no way to do so\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ni expect to be apple to find out if a disk is spun up or sleeping with a simple API call. this really is pretty basic functionality. i need it because i don't want to wake disks if they are sleeping by doing S.M.A.R.T. status checking.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthere is no way to determine if a disk is sleeping\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nApple's \"Spindown HD\" (part of CHUD) is able to determine this information but Apple doesn't want to share how it is done. Refer to a mailing list thread on Darwin-drivers@lists.apple.com  at the time this bug was filed. \r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-drivers/2011/May/index.html\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ni'd also be interested in a non-official and semi-reliable way to do this, i.e. the way Spindown HD does this."
