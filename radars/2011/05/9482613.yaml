    description: "Summary:\r\nRealVNC client can not log into Lion's multiuser VNC.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Screen Sharing on target Mac running Lion, preferably build 11A459e.\r\n2. Download RealVNC viewer[1] on another Mac, preferably running Snow Leopard 10.6.7 10J869.\r\n3. Open RealVNC viewer and log into the target Mac by it's IP. Select a method of encryption.\r\n4. Authenticate using password set in target Mac's preferences. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLogin screen will be interactive, allowing user to log in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDepends on level of encryption selected in step 3.\r\n- With \"prefer on\": Login screen is uninteractive, except user icons look clickable after first click event.\r\n- With \"prefer off\": Login screen is totally uninteractive, user icons greyed (disabled).\r\n- With \"always on\": Error - \"Unable to connect to VNC Server using your chosen security setting. Either upgrade VNC Server to a more recent version from RealVNC Ltd, or select a weaker level of encryption.\"\r\n- With \"always maximum\": Error - \"Unable to connect to VNC Server using your chosen security setting. Either upgrade VNC Server to a more recent version from RealVNC Ltd, or select a weaker level of encryption.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nRealVNC was able to view Screen Sharing correctly in Snow Leopard, if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm aware that RealVNC is not an Apple product, however I'm submitting this bug report because Screen Sharing claims to use the VNC protocol (\"Other users can access your computer's screen at vnc://10.0.0.8/ or by looking for “NCC-1701” in the Finder sidebar.\") and is incompatible with a known working implementation of that protocol.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1. http://www.realvnc.com/products/enterprise/macosx.html"
