    description: "Summary:\r\nUIWebView doesn't display videos anymore in iOS 4.3\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nwrite a app that sends a UIWebView directly to URLs pointing to MP4 video files...on iOS 4.2 or below this presents the video to the user in fullscreen mode, on 4.3 only the audio is playing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ni expect UIWebView to play videos in 4.3 just as it did in any previous release\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nonly audio is playing.\r\n - (void)webView:(UIWebView *)_webView didFailLoadWithError:(NSError *)error\r\n is called with \"Plug-in handled load\" error\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nhappens on iOS simulator and hardware starting with 4.3\r\nif the video is visible or not seems to be related to how deep the UIWebView is buried within the view hierarchy, but the fact that the presented videos can't be watched fullscreen in 4.3 seems to be universally true.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ni've uploaded a fairly small sample project exhibiting the issue. just launch from xcode, click on buttons labeled \"bug\" a few times to navigate to the webview and ... either observe a video (4.2 or lower) or only audio (4.3)."
