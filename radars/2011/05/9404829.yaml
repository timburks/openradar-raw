    description: "09-May-2011 12:14 AM Dan Byler:\r\nSummary: After selecting a block of text with the mouse, shift-{up|left|right} always change the selection from the top.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Xcode, Safari, TextEdit, etc., select some text with the mouse (dragging downwards)\r\n2. Type Shift-{Up arrow|left arrow|right arrow} (or Shift-Control-{n|p|f})\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the chronological endpoint of the selection to be modified by the arrow keys. I.e. if I drag downwards and release the mouse, I would expect the bottom point of the selection to be modified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nShift-{Up arrow|left arrow|right arrow} always modify the top point of the selection.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is particularly frustrating in Xcode."
