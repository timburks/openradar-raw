    description: "Summary: The word click is translated as \"kliknout\" (verb), \"kliknutí\" (noun), and the word \"double-click\" as \"poklikání\". The former, although not used except for computer slang, may be a matter of taste, the latter (\"poklikání\") sounds ridiculous. Possible alternatives are \"klepnout, klepnutí, poklepání\" or \"kliknout, kliknutí, dvojité kliknutí\".\r\n\r\nDiscussion: The word \"kliknout\" and derived words is often used in Czech for English \"click\" in the computer context, it's a widely used slang and comprehensible to anyone with some experience with computers. The corresponding slang for \"double-click\" is \"dvojklik / dvojité kliknutí\" (noun), \"kliknout dvakrát\" (verb). Poklikání sounds very weird. Former Czech Mac OS localizations since System 6 have used the words \"klepnout\" and \"poklepat\" (tap, tap two or more times, respectively). This was a very natural choice that avoided slang (anything with \"klik\"), awkward or non-existing words with funny associations (\"poklikání\" associates \"popukání\", \"pokakání\", \"poblinkání\", informal words for laughter, excrements and vomit), and I believe that it was universally comprehensible. \"Kliknutí\", while informal, will be comprehensible to people that already have experience with computers and know the English word \"click\". So choice between the two may be a matter of taste, but if for some reason you want to change \"poklepat\" to \"kliknout\", it would be better to use \"kliknout dvakrát\", \"dvojité kliknutí\" and certainly not \"poklikání\"."
