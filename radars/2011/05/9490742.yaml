    description: "Summary:\r\nThe _to_ argument which specifies the location of the new image version created with the AppleScript duplicate command should be optional. An image version’s properties only give away the project a selected image version is in. Should a scripter want to duplicate the currently selected image version and that item is located in an album, there’s no way to find out which. By omitting the location specifier a selected image version could be duplicated in place. This action would also more closely resemble the Duplicate Version user command found in the Photos menu.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select an image and run the following AppleScript.\r\ntell application \"Aperture\"\r\n   set _selection to selection\r\n   set _selectedImageVersion to item 1 of _selection\r\n   duplicate _selectedImageVersion\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected image version is duplicated in place just as if the user selected the Duplicate Version command from the Photos menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAppleScript Error: Aperture got an error: Some parameter is missing for duplicate."
