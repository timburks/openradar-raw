    description: "Summary:  iOS is pretty good at autodetecting phone number strings and hyperlinking them to allow instantaneous dialing.  But the calendar app has a bug that prevents dialing phone numbers that include the \"#\" symbol.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create a calendar event with the following details:\r\n\r\n    Title: Weekly Conference Call to Discuss Sales\r\n    Time: Friday July 6 2007 13:00-13:30\r\n    Location: Banff conference room \r\n    Notes:  concall: 622-555-1212,,453452# url: http://www.foo.com \r\n\r\n2. save the event\r\n3. view the Event Details for this calendar item\r\n4. note that the ENTIRE concall phone number (\"622-555-1212,,453452#\") is a hyperlink\r\n5. tap the hyperlinked concall number\r\n6. you will be prompted with a \"Cancel / Call\" dialog box - tap the \"Call\" button\r\n7. nothing happens (i.e., no phone call)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe phone should dial the \"622-555-1212,,453452#\" number\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe phone does not dial the number.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nthis has never worked.  (NOTE this problem does not occur with my coworker's BlackBerry...)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAs an enterprise user, I have a calendar that is FULL of this phone number format, since the \"#\" is frequently used to interact with conference calls or voicemail systems.  The only way to dial them is to carefully copy the number, switch to the iPhone app, paste in the new number, delete the # and then dial.\r\n\r\n\r\nnote that this problem with the pound sign seems to be specific to the calendar app.\r\n\r\ni.e., if you launch notes.app and add \"622-555-1212,,232323#\" the resulting hyperlink WILL dial properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: 23-May-2011 I was notified that this is a duplicate of apple bug #9367037"
