    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen duplicating image versions in Aperture using AppleScript, not the image version is duplicated but the master file along with all image versions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project and name it “Test.”\r\n2. Import a single photograph into the new project.\r\n3. Select the image and create three new versions of it using the Duplicate Version command from the Photos menu (or press alt-V).\r\n4. Select one of the newly created versions and run the following AppleScript:\r\ntell application \"Aperture\"\r\n   set _selection to selection\r\n   set _selectedImageVersion to item 1 of _selection\r\n   duplicate _selectedImageVersion to project \"Test\"\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new image version is created based on the selected image version. A new master file is not created. The behavior should be the same as the Duplicate Version command in the Photos menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe master file for the currently selected image version is duplicated on disk and added to the project along with all previous image versions. Instead of one new image version, four new image versions appear. All belonging to a new master file."
