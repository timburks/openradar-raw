    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning the \"do script\" AppleScript command causes Terminal to open a new window. If Terminal is not yet open, it will be launched as usual, which opens a window. This results in two windows, one on top of the other.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Quit Terminal if it is running.\r\n1. Open AppleScript Editor.\r\n2. Enter this line: tell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"echo hi\"\r\n3. Click \"Run\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTerminal opens with a single window that contains the results of the script.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTerminal opens with its usual default window, then opens a second window with the exact same frame and runs the script in the second window.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis behavior is supported by applications like TextEdit. If you open TextEdit, then open a file, the initial blank window is \"taken over\" by the file you just opened.\r\n\r\nEven if this is decided to be proper behavior, the two windows should at least be tiled rather than having the exact same frame."
