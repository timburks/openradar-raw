    description: "Besides the reverse geocoder API in MapKit, we'd love to have a forward geocoder API. Ideally, the API should accept structured data (separate fields for street address, city, zip, state, country) as well as a one-line string (the same way, maps.google.com accepts it).\r\n\r\nThe API should return a list of matches along with their latitude/longitude (the list being needed for ambiguous addresses)."
