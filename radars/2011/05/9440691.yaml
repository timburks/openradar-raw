    description: "This is a feature request to disclose the fact that a NSobject dragged from the Object Library and with it's class changed to another object that is available in the Object Library is different from dragging a instance of that type from the Object Library.\r\n\r\nFor example dragging a NSObject and changing it to a NSDrawer, states in the display : \"Custom Class, Class NSDrawer\" the same as dragging a second NSDrawer from the library.\r\n\r\nThe underlying structure in the xib file discloses that the first one is actually a NSCustomObject, while only the second one is a NSDrawer, and this can cause major problems in the specific case of NSDrawer for example as illustrated in my test project.\r\n\r\nThe first object is described as :\r\n\r\n<object class=\"NSCustomObject\" id=\"999004482\">\r\n\t<string key=\"NSClassName\">NSDrawer</string>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\nthe second one as:\r\n\r\n<object class=\"NSDrawer\" id=\"586887452\">\r\n\t<nil key=\"NSNextResponder\"/>\r\n\t<string key=\"NSContentSize\">{100, 100}</string>\r\n\t<string key=\"NSMinContentSize\">{0, 0}</string>\r\n\t<string key=\"NSMaxContentSize\">{10000, 10000}</string>\r\n\t<int key=\"NSPreferredEdge\">2</int>\r\n\t<double key=\"NSLeadingOffset\">0.0</double>\r\n\t<double key=\"NSTrailingOffset\">15</double>\r\n\t<nil key=\"NSParentWindow\"/>\r\n\t<nil key=\"NSDelegate\"/>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\nAside from the missing attributes in the inspector pane for the first one it is indistinguishable from the second one in the interface.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAdditionally if a custom object's class is changed into a class that exists in the Object Library it could be effectively transformed into that altogether instead of remaining a NSCustomObject with a class that is not custom."
