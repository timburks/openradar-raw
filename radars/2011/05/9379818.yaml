    description: "03-May-2011 07:48 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to save changes to a Core Data model in Xcode 4, Xcode beachballs and stops responding while using 100% of a CPU core. Eventually it must be killed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project using the iOS \"navigation based application\" template. When prompted for the app name, make sure \"use Core Data\" is checked.\r\n\r\n2. In the new project, add an attribute to the \"Event\" entity created by the template.\r\n\r\n3. Save changes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to save changes to a Core Data model.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode beachballs when attempting to save changes, using 100% of a CPU core, for as long as you care to let it do so.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis worked just fine in Xcode 3.x. In fact right now I use screen sharing to run Xcode 3 on a different Mac whenever I need to edit a Core Data model.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAfter talking to various people about this I decided on a clean install of Xcode 4.0.2. I did this by running /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools, rebooting the Mac, and running the Xcode 4.0.2 installer again. This did not affect the results described above in any way.\r\n\r\nThe attached document archive includes:\r\n\r\niShowU-Capture2.mov: Video demonstrating the steps above, from launching Xcode through killing it.\r\n[For OpenRadar, see http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14191/bug-9379818.mov, other documents not included.]\r\n\r\n04-May-2011 11:59 AM Tom Harrington:\r\nI tried repeating the steps to reproduce in a new user account which had never used Xcode. The results were exactly the same."
