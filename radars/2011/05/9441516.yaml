    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe word \"Select\" and derived words (as in \"Select All\", \"Selected\", \"Selection\") is translated as \"Vybrat\" (\"Vybrat vše\", \"Vybrané\", \"Výběr\") instead of \"Označit\" (\"Označit vše\", \"Označené\", \"Označené\"), which is a better alternative in most context and has been used in Czech Mac OS localization in the past (probably since System 6.0).\r\n\r\nDiscussion:\r\n\r\n\"Vybrat\" means to pick one or a small number of elements, it would be used is used as a natural translation of \"Choose\" or \"Pick\" in most context. It can be used to mean \"to select an arbitrary area\" (as opposed to one of a few predefined areas). \"Vybrat vše\" as a translation for \"Select All\" also sounds very unnatural (similar to \"Choose all\" in English) and suggest the other common meaning of the word \"vybrat\": to withdraw or scoop out.\r\n\r\n\"Označit\" covers all the meanings in which Select is used in Mac software and can be more naturally used in the context \"Select an area\" (\"Označit oblast\"), \"Select all\", (\"Označit vše\"). The only possible drawback is that \"Označit\" can be used to mean \"to mark\". This should not be an issue, as various more specific translation of the word \"Mark\" can be used when needed. (Mail already uses \"Vložit značku\". Alternatives include \"Vložit/Přidat značku/označení\". In context where \"Mark as ...\" needs to be used \"Označit jako ...\" can also be used without ambiguity.).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, \"Označit\" has been used for \"Select\" since classic Mac OS and Czech Mac users are used to it."
