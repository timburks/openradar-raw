    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile MPMusicPlayerController has API to set the playback queue (-setQueueWithQuery:, -setQueueWithItemCollection:), it has no API to get the playback queue. \r\n\r\nConsequently, it is impossible to determine which playlist music is playing from, or sort-order if no playlist contains the nowPlayingItem. This type of information is important for my application, Seamless (<seamlessapp.com>), in particular, because it means we cannot preserve a user's position in a playlist / sort-order when transitioning their music back to their Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Observe that there is no API for getting the playback queue from MPMusicPlayerController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be an API for getting the playback queue from MPMusicPlayerController.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no API for getting the playback queue from MPMusicPlayerController."
