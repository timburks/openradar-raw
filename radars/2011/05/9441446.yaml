    description: "Summary: The standard system-wide cmd-D  keyboard shortcut for \"Don't Save\" does not seem to work in the new save-before-closing dialogs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a new document in Preview or TextEdit. Close it without saving. When the save dialog appears, press cmd-D\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The dialog should be dismissed with \"Don't Save\".\r\n\r\nActual Results: Nothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression: I have tried it with Preview and TextEdit and preferred language set to English and Czech. Other system settings were set to their default state as far as I know.\r\n\r\nNotes: I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it's certainly annoying for any long-time Mac users that are used to this system-wide shortcut."
