    description: "Summary:  In the iPhone calendar app, the text in the \"Location\" field cannot be copied, nor does the iPhone provide a link for dialing a phone number or browsing to a URL.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create a calendar item with the following details:\r\n\r\n    Title: Weekly Conference Call to Discuss Sales\r\n    Time: Friday July 6 2007 13:00-13:30\r\n    Location: concall 622-555-1212 PIN:453452 url: http://www.foo.com \r\n    Notes:  discuss sales figures for the 200703-04 quarter blah blah blah\r\n\r\n2. save the item \r\n3. view the Event Details for this calendar item\r\n4. try to interact with the data in the Location field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe phone number (622-555-1212) in the Location field should be hyperlinked to allow easy calling the number via Phone.app\r\nThe URL (http://www.foo.com) in the Location field should be hyperlinked to allow easy browsing via Safari.app\r\nThe text in the Location field should be selectable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe phone number (622-555-1212) in the Location field IS NOT a hyperlink\r\nThe URL (http://www.foo.com) in the Location field IS NOT a hyperlink\r\nThe text in the Location field IS NOT selectable.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAs an enterprise user, I have a calendar that is FULL of appointments like this, where there is a long phone number and/or URL in the location field.  Dealing with these is embarassingly antiquated, whereby my only option is to briefly memorize the necessary data and then launch the appropriate app (phone or safari) and manually enter the phone number of URL.\r\n\r\nCompare this to a blackberry or Android phone, where the OS autodetects the number sequence and the URL and offers the ability to instantly dial the number of browse the URL."
