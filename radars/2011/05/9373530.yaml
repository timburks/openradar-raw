    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to set a property in UIWebView to disable automatic fullscreen video playback on an external display, if connected via a Digital AV Adapter. Some Apps rely on the external display to display specific information. In this case, video content in a UIWebView should be shown inline and not use the external screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an iPad App that makes use of an externally connected screen and contains the following views:\r\nInternal iPad Screen: UIView with a UIWebView\r\nExternal Screen (connected via Digital AV Adapter): UIView with some UILabels or whatever\r\nIf a website with HTML5 video is shown inside the UIWebView (e.g. vimeo.com) located on the internal iPad screen, the video is shown on the external display in fullscreen with the message \"TV Connected - This video is playing on the TV\" in the UIWebView.\r\nSetting the allowsInlineMediaPlayback property of the UIWebView to YES does not change anything in this case.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect that it's possible to disable the automatic fullscreen video playback when an external screen is connected. In some cases it makes sense, that videos are just played inline on the UIWebView and the content of the external screen stays as it is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nVideos are always played on the external screen. Setting the allowsInlineMediaPlayback property of the UIWebView to YES has no effect here.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis behavior was tested on an iPad 1 using a Digital AV Adapter to connect the iPad to a TV using HDMI."
