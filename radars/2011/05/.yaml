    description: "Summary:\r\nThe SD card slot placement on iMacs is not nearly obvious enough.\r\n\r\nMy aunt didn't even know she had an SD card slot!\r\n\r\nI have, 3 times, inserted an SD card into the optical drive bay (I cannot see *either* of them when sitting down at the iMac). I am not the only one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInsert SD card into iMac by feel.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSD card should always go into SD slot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is entirely too easy to put an SD card into the (invisible) optical drive bay.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPutting the slot at the front edge rather than the rear edge, so they weren't in the same plane would help. Putting the slot on the front face of the iMac would make it more obvious, although it would also make the iMac less pretty.\r\nMaking the SD slot horizontal would avoid any chance of confusing it with the vertical optical bay."
