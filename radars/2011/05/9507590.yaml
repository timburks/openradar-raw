    description: "Recently, Apple introduced a change that iOS App Store promo codes are bound to the current minor version and are invalidated after a version update.\r\n\r\nThis causes\r\na) more effort to manage promo codes (minor version also has to be taken into account)\r\nb) bad reputation when a journalist hadn't yet redeemed the code and an update is released\r\nc) promo codes to be used up much more quickly, so the 50 codes limit harder to cope with.\r\n\r\nWe don't see any benefit from limiting promo codes to minor versions so we propose to roll back this change."
