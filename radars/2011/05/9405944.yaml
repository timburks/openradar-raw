    description: "09-May-2011 11:40 AM Tariq Zaid:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUsing an iPad 2 with the Smart Cover closed.  Device is locked.\r\n\r\nWhen your application is in the foreground (with cover closed) and you receive a local notification, the notification is launched properly (you hear the notification).  When you open the cover, the notification will be displayed with your application in the background.  If you press the action button on your notification, no UIApplicationDelegate callback is invoked.  You do NOT receive any notice of a button being pressed (as you do not differentiate between the Close button and the Action button).  As a result, if your application attempts to react to the action button, it's impossible.\r\n\r\nFor example: VoIP application trying to accept a phone call.  When receiving a phone call, the user opens the smart cover and sees the notification.  The user presses 'Answer' but the application receives no notification of Close/Answer and is forced to display another dialog of sorts to prompt the user to accept the call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1- Lock application using Smart Cover\r\n2- Receive a Local Notification\r\n3- Unlock application using Smart Cover\r\n4- You will see a notification (Expected)\r\n5- You press answer - No callbacks are called (Unexpected)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome callback on the UIApplicationDelegate that will tell us whether or not a local notification has been accepted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo callback, application must display a second prompt -- this is poor user experience.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown, but most likely not a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation: \"When the system delivers a local notification, several things can happen, depending on the application state and the type of notification. If the application is not frontmost and visible, the system displays the alert message, badges the application, and plays a soundâ€”whatever is specified in the notification. If the notification is an alert and the user taps the action button (or, if the device is locked, drags open the action slider), the application is launched. In the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method the application delegate can obtain the UILocalNotification object from the passed-in options dictionary by using the UIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey key. The delegate can inspect the properties of the notification and, if the notification includes custom data in its userInfo dictionary, it can access that data and process it accordingly. On the other hand, if the local notification only badges the application icon, and the user in response launches the application, the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method is invoked, but no UILocalNotification object is included in the options dictionary.\r\n\r\nIf the application is foremost and visible when the system delivers the notification, no alert is shown, no icon is badged, and no sound is played. However, the application:didReceiveLocalNotification: is called if the application delegate implements it. The UILocalNotification instance is passed into this method, and the delegate can check its properties or access any custom data from the userInfo dictionary."
