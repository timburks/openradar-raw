    description: "Summary:\r\nCompiling/assembling code containing the 'adrl' ARM pseudo instruction makes the ARM assembler crash. This is reproducible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assemble the attached file 'adrl.s' containg the adrl pseudo instruction\r\n/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/libexec/gcc/darwin/arm/as adrl.s\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCode is generated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nas aborts() without generating code.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo (not observed)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAny occurrence of 'adrl' seems to crash as.\r\n\r\nThis crash seems to happen already for quite some time, it was already mentioned on the ffmpeg-devel mailing list on Jan 19 2009, see http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2009-January/067808.html"
