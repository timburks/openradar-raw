    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Property List Editor (the standalone app) or Xcode 3, I could change the root type of a plist to be Array or Dictionary. In Xcode 4 I can't seem to do this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a plist file in Xcode 4\r\n- Attempt to change the Root type\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The top line in the property list has name \"Root\" and a Type popup menu to let you change the type\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- There is no apparent way to change the Root type of a plist in Xcode 4\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- It worked in Xcode 3 and the standalone Property List Editor"
