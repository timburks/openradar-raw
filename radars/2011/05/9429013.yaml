    description: "12-May-2011 09:51 PM Torsten Louland:\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm using Twitter 2.0.2. I hear that a new version is available. There's no way to find out from within Twitter :-( I go to the Mac App Store and sign in. The update page does not show me that there is an update. :-(  I go to the Twitter page which advertises version 2.1, and the purchase popup below the app icon says \"Installed\" - this is incorrect as I do not have 2.1 installed. The only version I have on my machine is version 2.0.2. There is no way that I can see to download the new version - the Mac App Store is consistent in its mistaken belief that I have v2.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNo idea. All I did was download Twitter from the Mac App Store on one occasion with no previous versions. If you want to check the account, the id is [redacted] - not the same as my developer id.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- I can be notified and can download an update from within Twitter\r\n- Mac App Store does not wait for me to log in before telling me there is an update available\r\n- The update page of the Mac App Store shows me that there is an update available\r\n- Mac App Store recognises that the version I have installed is older than the one its is offering and allows me to download the new one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNon of the expected results. Mac App Store incorrectly insists app is already installed and wont take any action.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe whole update process is irritating and disappointing in its deficiencies - I'm trying to convey the sentiment when the behaviour is a BACKWARD step from the current standard for best practice/behaviour, which is Sparkle, whereby you hear about updates for apps in a timely way (per preference) whenever you use the app, rather than being bothered for updates to apps that you may not necessarily use that frequently (ala Software Update, which may not be a scalable solution for all the updates to people's purchased apps)."
