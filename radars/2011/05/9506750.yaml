    description: "26-May-2011 10:28 AM Graham Lee:\r\nSummary: Because I most often use bug reporter to report issues found while developing, it should be integrated in Xcode as a productivity enhancement and to increase the likelihood that I actually file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode.\r\n2. Find a bug.\r\n3. Get frustrated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n4a. Go to the \"file a bug...\" item in Xcode, report the bug, take a deep breath, move on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n4b. realise that you have to switch to (or launch) a browser, log in, hope that JavaMonitor hasn't redirected the RadarWeb WOA to some other app, then report the bug. Get more frustrated instead and decide to file the bug later. Forget.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is around my 9th or 10th bug report of the month, so it's actually a reasonably frequent use case for me to find a bug while using Xcode and want to file it. If it's made easier, there's a higher chance that I'll do so."
