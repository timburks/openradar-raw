    description: "Summary: If you give a UIImagePickerController a cameraOverlayView, it does not interact properly with the shutter/iris animation. It displays on top of the iris initially, then once the iris opening animation starts, it jumps under the animation. It should either always be under the iris, or always be over it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load the PhotoPicker sample project (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/PhotoPicker/Introduction/Intro.html).\r\n2. Press the Photo button and observe the animation.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Set any UIView (a colored square will work) to the cameraOverlayView property of an UIImagePickerController.\r\n2. Present the UIImagePickerController and observe the animation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The cameraOverlayView should have a consistent Z ordering with respect to the iris, presenting a consistent animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The overlay displays on top of the iris initially, then jumps behind it when the animation starts. The effect is jarring.\r\n\r\nRegression: Bug occurs on iOS 4.3.3.\r\n\r\nNotes: The default camera controls display hybrid but consistent behaviour (some controls always on top of the iris, some controls always below the iris). Although always displaying the cameraOverlayView below the iris would be my preference, always displaying it on top would also be a big improvement."
