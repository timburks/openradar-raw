    description: "Summary:\r\nthere should be a \"snooze\" option to allow for repetition of a calendar reminder\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create a new future appointment in the calendar, with an alert set.\r\n2. wait for the new appointment alert to appear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA \"snooze\" option that will allow for the alert to be acknowledged while also guaranteeing that the alert will be repeated again in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo snooze option is presented.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happen with all revisions of the iphone firmware.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI realize that the \"second alert\" option that is presented when creating the appointment is intended to address this need, but I think a true snooze option would be tremendously useful. (like the \"snooze\" option that appears when an alarm occurs)\r\n\r\nthanks!"
