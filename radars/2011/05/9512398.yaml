    description: "Summary: Dates in the form 2011-05-25T22:56:03+00:00 cannot be parsed using NSDateFormatter, specifically the time zone section. You can parse time zones like \"GMT+00:00\" and time zones like \"+0000\" but not \"+00:00\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Try to parse a date generated by MySQL on iOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: You can somehow parse a date in this format.\r\n\r\nActual Results: This is not possible using NSDateFormatter.\r\n\r\nNotes: A lot of people suggest http://boredzo.org/iso8601unparser/ but it's kind of silly to add 3rd party code to your project for something so common. Also, reportedly, this code is very slow."
