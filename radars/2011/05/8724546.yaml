    description: "Summary:\r\nJapanese characters do not show up in Terminal.app. This affects the contents of the terminal itself as well as text in Terminal.app's preferences windows, but not the menus.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the system language to Japanese, open Terminal.app, and look at the preferences window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJapanese text should show up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does not. See the screenshot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI cannot get this to occur at will. It does not happen with other accounts on the same machine, and it does not happen in other applications under the same account. If I delete Terminal.app's preferences and launch the terminal, the problem disappears; but if I close the application and launch it again, the problem reoccurs. It looks like it's not affected by the contents of the preferences file (because it has been rewritten with the defaults by the second launch), but merely by its presence.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to have been encountered by other users (eg http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=10132801), so it's not an isolated case.\r\n\r\n15-Mar-2011 08:14 PM Camillo Lugaresi:\r\nIt turns out that this is actually a problem with OpenType fonts in general, not just Japanese."
