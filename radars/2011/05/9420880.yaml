    description: "Summary: NSDictionary with a NSNumber behaves differently on the iPad/iPhone device than it does on the simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n    NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];\r\n    [dict setObject:@\"Test 1\" forKey:[NSNumber numberWithDouble:-1.0]];\r\n    [dict setObject:@\"Test 2\" forKey:[NSNumber numberWithDouble:-2.0]];\r\n    NSString *result = [dict objectForKey:[NSNumber numberWithInt:-1]];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI'd expect result == @\"Test 1\", even on the device. I'd also expect the simulator and device to behave the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOn the device, result == nil. In the simulator, result == @\"Test 1\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt does work fine with positive numbers and when creating the two NSNumbers the same way (e.g. both with numberWithInt)."
