    description: "It would be really nice to have -[NSMutableArray setArray:copyItems:] to fill the gap between -[NSArray initWithArray:copyItems:] and -[NSMutable setArray:]. It's a pretty straightforward method, and could replace code that is inconvenient to write. (I've added it as a category, but would love to have it as API.)\r\n\r\n- (void) setArray:(NSArray*)array copyItems:(BOOL)flag\r\n{\r\n\tif (flag) {\r\n\t\t[self removeAllObjects];\r\n\t\tfor (id object in array) {\r\n\t\t\t[self addObject:[[object copy] autorelease]];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\t[self setArray:array];\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nI imagine that if implemented internally, one could get slightly higher performance through more intelligent memory management of internal structures than would be possible for third-party developers."
