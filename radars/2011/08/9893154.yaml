Here is a screenshot to illustrate: https://img.skitch.com/20110804-tdpdme94ttn8qjdnpwkf86p25h.jpg.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked perfectly in 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you open the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist and check the NSUserKeyEquivalents Dictionary, it becomes immediately apparent that the Menu titles have been stored without the final \">\" character. Here is a screenshot to illustrate: https://img.skitch.com/20110804-pd6sjfwm8psm2kswjmn9xi46ya.jpg.\r\n\r\nBy manually changing the plist values to include the final \">\" character at the end, I was able to re-activate the keyboard shortcuts as they used to work in 10.6."
