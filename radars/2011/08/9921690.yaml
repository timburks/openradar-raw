    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a svg document with many paths with a stroke defined, doing a getBBox call on a single path takes around a full second, in Mobile Safari. It should be near zero.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen testcase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNear 0 ms getBBox call, displayed on tc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAround 1 full second getBBox call, on an iPad.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUser Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 4_3_3 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.17.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.2 Mobile/8J3 Safari/6533.18.5\r\n\r\nTestcase is several hundred kilobytes big, so it's not posted here. When attachments are implemented, the tc will be attached."
