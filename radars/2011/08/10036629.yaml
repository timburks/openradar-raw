    description: "Summary: When a website asks for disk space for a HTML5-db and that window goes to the background, it is impossible to close the active window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open a few websites (e.g. Twitter) that ask for disk space to store a database.\r\n2) Switch to a different Safari window\r\n3) Try to close the window (either using cmd+w or with the mouse)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window closes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window stays on screen, the screen flashes and an alert sound is played.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSafari 5.0.4 (6533.20.27)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached screenshot (safari1.png) shows the situation after step 2). Note that the left window seems to be active.\r\nAdding to the confusion, some things (e.g. clicking a link or switching tabs) work quite well, so the problem isn't obvious.\r\n\r\n[the screenshot can be found at fs.tum.de/~migenda/apple/10036629/safari1.png]"
