    description: "Summary:\r\nApple recently announced that keychain syncing will not be a part of iCloud. I and many others have relied on and praised keychain syncing for a long time. It makes it incredibly easy to get back up and running on a new computer, or to make sure you always have your passwords on each of your computers. It encourages better security by making it easy to use different, lengthy passwords on different web sites without the concern that we'll forget them and be unable to log in.\r\n\r\nThere is at least one alternative in 1Password, but it relies on Dropbox for syncing, which has not shown itself to be particularly trustworthy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fill up Mr. Fusion\r\n2. Set the Destination Time on your DeLorean to July 1st, 2012\r\n3. Hit 88 miles per hour\r\n4. Attempt to sync your keychain\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour keychain should sync successfully with iCloud.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn our current timeline, the actual result is that keychain syncing fails because it's no longer available. (Perhaps you can prevent this future from happening!)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIndeed, keychain syncing has been supported for quite some time now (and at the moment, still is).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone."
