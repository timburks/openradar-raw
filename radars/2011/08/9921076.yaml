    description: "Summary:\r\nAll My Files indexes the content of certain* bundles.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRename the iPhoto library to some other name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll My Files doesn't show the bundle contents, as it would do with the originally named bundle. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe contents of the bundle are shown, including the photos themselves, the database files and support images such as the maps used in \"Places\" slideshows.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis only happens when the library is renamed from the default (on an English system, not tested in other languages) \"iPhoto Library\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA possible temporary workaround is to disable indexing for the affected bundle contents."
