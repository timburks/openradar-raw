    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCoreData throws an Exception when removing NSCollectionView Items and saving while NSCollectionView is performing it's animation.\r\n\r\nProject setup/environment: CoreData model with two entities: \"Item\" and \"RelatedItem\". \"Item\" has a relation to \"RelatedItem\". Both entities each contain two attributes: \"foo\" and \"bar\" (NSString), which are bound to the view (NSCollectionViewItem).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen attached Project or clone at https://github.com/artifacts/NSCollectionViewCoreDataBug\r\nHit \"Add\" button a couple of times. Some items will be added.\r\nSave document under an arbitrary name.\r\nStart clicking \"Remove\"-Button a couple of times and WHILE NSCollectionView IS ANIMATING hit Cmd-S to save.\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe document should be saved without error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCoreData could not fulfill a fault for '0x1001f40b0 x-coredata://64DE7FCC-8F74-4445-8F6F-173ECA2CB5C4/Item/p5'\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis also happens in undo/redo scenarios. E.g.: Add some items, save, remove all items, save again, undo until no more undo possible, redo, CRASH:\r\n\r\n2011-08-05 12:28:01.942 CollectionViewCoreDataBug[73308:a0f] CoreData could not fulfill a fault for '0x1004e73a0 x-coredata://0F566CD9-715B-46EB-8E2F-66EF9CA08869/Item/p1' 2011-08-05 12:28:02.493 CollectionViewCoreDataBug[73308:a0f] CoreData could not fulfill a fault for '0x10047fc30 x-coredata://0F566CD9-715B-46EB-8E2F-66EF9CA08869/RelatedItem/p4' 2011-08-05 12:28:02.587 CollectionViewCoreDataBug[73308:a0f] Cannot remove an observer for the key path \"relatedItem.bar\" from , most likely because the value for the key \"relatedItem\" has changed without an appropriate KVO notification being sent.
