    description: "When forwarding an email, the complete mail headers (including Received headers etc.) of the original mail are quoted in the forwarded mail.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't make sense and there's apparently no option to disable this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n<Apple>\r\nForwarding shows all header detail currently being displayed. What do you see if you go into the Mail menu → Preferences → Viewing and look at the \"Show header detail\" section?\r\n\r\n\r\n<GMT08-Aug-2011 23:37:12GMT> Ortwin Gentz:\r\nIt was set to \"All\" but didn't actually display all headers in mail display view. So in mail display view it behaved like \"Standard\" despite set to \"All\".\r\n\r\nI switched to Standard and the mail forwarding issue is gone.\r\nI switched back to All and now the mail display view also shows all headers which is OK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the forwarding issue is resolved but it seems the initial setting of the parameter (I think I never changed this) was wrong, at least in terms of how the mail display view behaved."
