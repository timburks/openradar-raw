    description: "Summary:\r\nMany apps offer a \"quiet time\" for notifications. This is useful because many people have multiple devices in the home, and there's a good chance not all of them will get switched to silent every night. There's also an opposite problem: there are some notifications a user may want to hear even when the device is on silent.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Purchase a bunch of Apple products—a couple might have two iPhone and two iPads.\r\n2. Enable some notification sounds for things like email, Twitter, and so on.\r\n3. Inevitably forget to set all 4+ devices to silent every single night.\r\n4. Go to sleep.\r\n5. Receive a spam email or an unimportant tweet from a friend on the other side of the world. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's not a problem because iOS knows these are unimportant alert sounds, and won't play them during times of the day that you don't want to be bothered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alert still goes off, probably waking you up. You may continue to get alerts until you find each device and turn them off.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable notifications for something important, like when a server goes down. Even phone calls or texts from certain people might be important.\r\n2. Set device to silent at night.\r\n3. Go to sleep.\r\n4. Receive an important alert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alert should still sound because iOS knows it's important to me. Clearly Apple recognizes there are cases like this, since alarms will sound even on silent mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo alerts will sound no matter how important they are.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
