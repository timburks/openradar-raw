    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf a user performs a drag from an application (ex: Finder or Safari), and performs a 4-finger full-screen-app swipe before the drag times out, the drag image may remain stuck on the screen\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable 3 finger drag (optional) and 4 finger left-right swipe in Trackpad Preferences\r\n2. Open a Terminal window in fullscreen (or any other application)\r\n3. In Safari, 3-finger drag to the left on an image (Click-drag works too)\r\n4. Release your fingers and quickly do a 4-finger drag to the left.\r\n5. Release your fingers.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwitching spaces acts as a mouse-up or something similar so that the image drag is correctly cancelled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is stuck on the screen even after releasing and clicking, as long as you are in a different fullscreen app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis appears to be a new issue introduced in OS X 10.7."
