    description: "Summary:\r\niCal does not respond correctly to Applescript request for calendars if it is not launched. An empty list is returned.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure iCal is not running.\r\n2. Copy the following single line into a blank Applescript Editor window.\r\n    tell application \"iCal\" to calendars\r\n3. Press Run and view the Results pane.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niCal launches and the Results pane shows a list of iCal's calendar properties.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCal launches and the Results pane shows an empty list.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis test works as expected with iCal 4. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe script works when iCal is running. It appears that iCal is not dealing with Applescript requests for calendar/event data in general when it is also being launched. \r\n\r\ne.g.: When iCal is not running the following line. \r\ntell application \"iCal\" to events of calendar 1\r\ngives: \r\nerror \"iCal got an error: Canâ€™t get calendar 1. Invalid index.\" number -1719 from calendar 1\r\nThis test works as expected when iCal is running.\r\n\r\nRunning counter to this is the results of the following:\r\ntell application \"iCal\" to windows\r\n(which gives a result)"
