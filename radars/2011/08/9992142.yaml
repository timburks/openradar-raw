    description: "Summary: A class that has a readonly public property and a private readwrite proprety is not handled correctly with the ARC converter in Xcode 4.2. The public property changes from \"retain\" to \"strong\", but not the private one, causing problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n- Have a class with a public and a private property, something like : \r\n\r\n.h \r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly, retain) NSObject* anyProprety;\r\n\r\n.m, in class extension\r\n@property (nonatomic, readwrite, retain) NSObject* anyProprety;\r\n\r\n- Run the \"Convert to ARC\" command in Xcode 4.2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Both property declaration are changed to the strong attribute.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Only the .h property declaration is changed to strong, causing other problem and warning in the project.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: Attached a example project. It's currently in manual memory management, just run the convertor on it."
