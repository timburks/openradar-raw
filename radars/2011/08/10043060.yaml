    description: "Summary:\r\nTo better fit inside their controls, some strings in the German localization of iBooks for iPhone and iPod touch need to be shorter. One translation is missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sign in to the German iTunes Store\r\n2. Launch iBooks\r\n3. Tap on rightmost tab named *Gekaufte Artikel*\r\n4. Tap on the left segment named *Nicht auf diesem iPhone*\r\n5. Move the view up and tap on the last cell in the grouped table named *Alle gekauften anzeigen*\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt step 3, the title for the rightmost tab reads *Einkäufe* (english: Purchases). At step 4, the left segment of the Segmented Control contains the string *Nicht geladen* (english: Not downloaded). At step 5, the name of the last cell in the grouped table is *Alle Einkäufe anzeigen* (english: Show all purchases). The view visible after step 5 contains the following elements:\r\n- Navigation Bar titled *Alle Einkäufe*\r\n- Back button in Navigation Bar named *Einkäufe*\r\n- Segemented Control with the segments named *Aktuell*, *Titel*, and *Autor*\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt step 3, the rightmost tab is named *Gekaufte Artikel* (english: Purchased items) which is too many characters and is too condensed. At step 4, the left segment of the Segmented Control contains the string *Nicht auf diesem iPhone* (english: Not on this iPhone) which is too wide and touches the edge of the control. At step 5, the last cell in the grouped table contains *Alle gekauften anzeigen* (english: Show purchased). The view visible after step 5 contains the following elements:\r\n- Navigation Bar titled *All Purchased* which is not translated\r\n- Back button in Navigation Bar named *Gekaufte Ar…* which is shortened\r\n- Segmented Control with the segments named *Book Title* which is not translated, and *Name des Autors* which is too wide to fit the control."
