    description: "Summary:\r\nThe userAcceleration values from the CMMotionManager are incorrect. I try to calculate the distance from the acceleration values by double integrating over the acceleration values. The distances are between 5-20 cm. I've made up to 1000 experiments to test the accuracy of the sensor. I discovered that the deceleration values are always too high and does not correlate with the true values. I've made some tests with the Acceleration framework to test if the error is related to the hardware but those values seem to be correct. I've attached two images which shows the accelerations from CoreMotion and Acceleration frameworks. The acceleration from CoreMotion lead to a negative velocity which is not correct.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Moving the iPhone and stop the movement\r\n2. Access the acceleration values of the iPhone through CMMotionManager (userAcceleration property)\r\n3. Double integrate over the values to get the velocity and distances\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe acceleration values should be same as the values from the Acceleration framework on a planar plate. The velocity when moving the iPhone and stopping at a specific position should go back to zero.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe acceleration values are incorrect since the velocity always becomes negative.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've tested the acceleration on an iPhone 4. Other people seem to have the same problems (see https://devforums.apple.com/message/421833)"
