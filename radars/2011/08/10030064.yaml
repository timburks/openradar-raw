    description: "26-Aug-2011 12:00 PM Patrick Burleson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAppleTV should provide a search function or ability to filter a list of movies and tv shows. I currently have 100 movies in my iTunes library (and growing) and it's not the best user experience trying to get to a specific movie way down the list. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have lots of movies or tv shows in iTunes. \r\n\r\n2. Go to the movie list\r\n\r\n3. Want to get to a movie towards the bottom of the list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nQuick way to search or filter the movie list\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nScrolling, missing the movie because I was scrolling too fast, scroll back up. Finally get my movie."
