    description: "Summary:\r\nMission Control truncates the name of \"Desktop 1\" under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Mission Control\r\n2) Add multiple desktops (have at least 2 desktops)\r\n3) Without leaving Mission Control, drag around the desktops at the top of the page to rearrange them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe spaces should rearrange.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe spaces do rearrange, but the name of \"Desktop 1\" is truncated to \"Deskt...\" in the process.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on 10.7.2 beta 2 only.\r\n\r\n29-Aug-2011 11:03 PM Mike Beasley:\r\nStill exists in 11C43\r\n\r\n05-Oct-2011 12:45 AM Mike Beasley:\r\nStill in GM\r\n\r\n19-Mar-2012 09:08 PM Mike Beasley:\r\nAppears to be resolved as of Mountain Lion DP2. Not sure if it's a bug in Mountain Lion, but the different spaces no longer each have a name. Only the first one does, and as a result, it doesn't try to append the \"1\" which lead to truncation.\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed.\r\n\r\n14-Jun-2012 10:22 PM Mike Beasley:\r\nThis bug has reappeared in later DPs of Mountain Lion. Currently present in DP4. The 'solution' in DP2 appears to have been the result of a bug causing the spaces to not get names, which was fixed, resulting in the return of this bug. Yay.\r\n\r\n--Apple sent me a message saying Mountain Lion should resolve the issue--\r\n\r\n27-Jul-2012 02:50 AM Mike Beasley:\r\nMountain Lion GM solves this issue!\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
