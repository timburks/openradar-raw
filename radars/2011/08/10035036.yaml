    description: "Summary: If a message contains image attachments it is sent as rich text (text/html) instead of plain text regardless of user settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start composing a message. Fill in the subject and recipient fields.\r\n\r\n2. Make sure it is plain text by choosing Format > Make Plain Text if the menu item is available.\r\n\r\n3a. Type at least one character and attach at least one image file (e.g. a JPEG).\r\n\r\n3b. Alternatively, type no text at all and attach at least two image files (e.g. JPEGs).\r\n\r\n4. Send the message.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The message should be sent as plain text (i.e. the part representing the body should have Content-Type set to text/plain).\r\n\r\nActual Results: The message is sent as rich text (text/html) with embedded images (using multipart/related and IMG elements)\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: User settings aren't respected, resulting in images sent embedded in a HTML layout, which also makes them hard to extract in some other email clients (particularly Microsoft Outlook). In the previous versions of Mac OS X it was possible to send images as regular attachments by using plain text, now it is almost impossible."
