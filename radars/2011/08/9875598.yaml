    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf another application is activated while the System Preferences window is displaying the picture menu in the “Users & Groups” section, the System Preferences window will not come to the front when activated via Mission Controls or via Command+Tab.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a Finder window.\r\n\r\n2. Open System Preferences.\r\n\r\n3. Select the Users & Groups icon.\r\n\r\n4. If no user account is selected, select a user account.\r\n\r\n5. Click the user picture to display the picture menu.\r\n\r\n6. Switch to the Finder with any of Mission Control, Command+Tab, a click on its Dock icon, or a mouse click in its window.\r\n\r\n7. Attempt to switch back to System Preferences with any of Mission Control, Command+Tab, or a click on its Dock icon.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSystem preferences will be activated, and its window will become frontmost.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSystem Preferences is not activated. Its window remains behind the frontmost window.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhen this bug is triggered, System Preferences can still be activated by clicking in its window, and it will then resume normal behaviour."
