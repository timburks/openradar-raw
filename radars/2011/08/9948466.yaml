    description: "12-Aug-2011 07:01 PM Eric Wing:\r\n'Screen Shot 2011-08-12 at 6.51.21 PM.png' and 'Mac mini.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n12-Aug-2011 07:01 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nI tried to enable layer backing on the OpenGL view from the developer example and it causes my computer to hang/freeze and I must hard reboot.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload the GLEssentials project from the Apple sample code online.\r\nGo to the Nib and change the opengl view so it is Core Animation layer backed.\r\nBuild and run the example.\r\nIt hangs my computer and I must reboot. (Only tried on my Mac Mini...config attached)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I tried the Layer Backed OpenGL View example from the Sample code. It is not rendering correctly. The picture should look like Earth, but it looks more like a wire-framed sphere, but it isn't wireframe. (There is a checkbox to enable wireframe which looks different.) Screenshot is also attached. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould not freeze.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFreezes\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tested the Layer Backed OpenGL view example on both a Mac Mini and Macbook Air 11\" (first gen). Both produced the same image."
