    description: "Summary:\r\nOur app uses NSTask to create ssh tunnels for port forwarding. When the app is quit we send [task terminate] and will kill() the process if the task does not terminate quickly. \r\n\r\nThe -terminate method does not terminate the task and ssh is still running after it returns. The kill() function says that the signal has been blocked in Console.app.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate and launch a new ssh task with NSTask. Call -terminate on the process, see that is is still running. Call the function kill(pid, SIGKILL) on the pid of the process and see in the console that is has been blocked.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApparently this should be working according to: https://devforums.apple.com/message/519985#519985\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-[NSTask terminate] does not terminate the NSTask. kill(pid, SIGKILL) also does not kill the NSTask because it is blocked by the sandbox.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks find outside of the sandbox.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-[NSTask interrupt] also does not stop the running task."
