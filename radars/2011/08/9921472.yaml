    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you use different desktop pictures, opening a folder in Launchpad on a desktop, and then switch to another desktop to reopen Launchpad issues to have the top of the screen using the actual desktop picture, and the bottom using the old one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave different desktop pictures on at least two spaces.\r\n\r\nOpen Launchpad on space 1, then open a folder in Launchpad. Leave Launchpad without closing the folder.\r\n\r\nOn space 2 (with a different desktop picture) open Launchpad again. The top of the screen uses the new screenshot, the bottom uses the old one. Closing the folder makes the problem go away.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen opening Launchpad in a such case, the top and the bottom of the screen should use the new desktop picture.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe top of the screen uses the new desktop picture, the bottom uses the old one."
