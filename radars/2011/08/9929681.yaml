    description: "I would like to be able bulk export device IDs from the dev portal so I can import them into another.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAdd 43 devices to your personal development account, doing development for a friend.\r\n\r\nGet hired by said company, which has its own development account, and will now be the source of all things provisioning.\r\n\r\nTime to move those 43 devices over.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nLog in to personal account.\r\nClick on an \"Export devices\" button in the portal.  \r\nEdit file to take out devices not appropriate for moving to the company\r\nLog out\r\nLog in to business account\r\nClick on \"import devices\" in the portal.\r\nUpload.  Time for a cheeseburger\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLog into personal account in Safari\r\nLog into business account in Chrome\r\n\r\nin chrome {\r\n    Go to \"add devices\" part of the portal\r\n}\r\n\r\nforeach (device) {\r\n    in safari {\r\n        Click \"Details\" for the device\r\n        Double click UUID\r\n        cmd-C\r\n    }\r\n    in chrome {\r\n        Click plus sign\r\n        paste uuid\r\n    }\r\n    in safari {\r\n        Double click-and-drag name\r\n        cmd-C\r\n    }\r\n    in chrome {\r\n        paste name\r\n    }\r\n    in safari {\r\n        click cancel\r\n    }\r\n    # hope session doesn't time out\r\n    # hope don't lose place and redundantly add a device again\r\n}\r\n\r\nGranted, I could paste into a document an then upload that, but that's still a lot of clicks and back and forth, waiting for web pages to load."
