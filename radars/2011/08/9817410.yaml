    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nLion has a bunch of 32-bit sides of built-in apps, such as /bin/ls and TextEdit and AddressBook.\r\n\r\nThis seems redundant because the OS can only be installed on 64-bit hardware.  Figured ya'll can save some bytes and testing matrix by only have 64-bit versions of built-in / Lion-only software."
