    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPhone currently has the ability to make emergency calls, but if there is an emergency where a family or friend should be contacted (following a call to 911 of course), nobody is going to know that number. \r\n\r\nI request a feature that allows a contact to be marked as an Emergency contact with a possible relationship indicator. This list should be available from the Emergency call screen. \r\n\r\nAdditionally/Optionally, the phone could also allow the owner to document a medical condition and what to do in the case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock the iPhone\r\n2. Tap Emergency Call\r\n3. Dial the Phone Number of a stranger's significant other\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. A button exist to view owner-specified contacts that should be called in an emergency\r\n2. When the button is tapped, a table view shall be displayed that lists important contacts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The user can only dial a number or leave the screen\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis occurs in all versions of iOS"
