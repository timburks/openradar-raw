    description: "Summary:  \r\n\r\nApplescripts can only access the selected messages (according to the message list view) of a message viewer, and  cannot access the action message in a conversation view.   \r\n\r\nThe Conversation view gives the user the ability to select a single action message that the user want to an applescript to act upon but the applescript dictionary and implementation does not provide a way of accessing this message.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect a specific message in a conversation view and run an applescript that requests the selected messages.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe applescript returns the message of the conversation view that the user is focused on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe applescript continues to return the list of messages selected in the message list view and does not return the message of the conversation view that the user has selected\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be preferred to have a new applescript terminology to access the action message."
