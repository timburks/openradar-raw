    description: "26-Aug-2011 12:03 PM Eric Wing:\r\n'LayerBackedOpenGLViewWithWebView.zip' and 'MacMini_Lion_10.7.1.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n26-Aug-2011 12:03 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nI am trying to get a layer backed WebView to work in an OpenGL app. (I want to put a web view on top of an OpenGL surface, either a CAOpenGLLayer hosted in a view or layer backed NSOpenGLView).\r\n\r\nWhen I do this and go to the Google News page, I see messages in my console and it almost always leads to a crash with the message in the console:\r\n\r\nunlockFocus called too many time.\r\nAssertion failed: (s->stack->next != NULL), function CGGStackRestore, file Context/CGGStack.c, line 116.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is a simple modification to Apple's developer example called \"Layer Backed OpenGL View\". All I do is add a WebView in Interface Builder and check the enable layer backed mode. (In my real app, we use a CAOpenGLLayer and do all the layer hosting setup programmatically.)\r\n\r\nBuild and run the app. In the app, there is a button to enable layer backing which brings up the HUD. In the HUD is the WebView. It should open to Google.\r\n\r\nClick on the link to the News page. Usually the page starts to load, and then I see a pause, some console messages appear, and then ultimately, the assertion error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWebview should render the requested page without console messages or crashes or errors. There shouldn't be a pause either.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a pause. There is a crash/assertion error. I get output like the following:\r\n\r\n2011-08-25 18:51:05.876 LayerBackedOpenGLView[12233:707] NSOpenGLView pixelFormat RendererID = 0102261a\r\nDVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0xa4ab3b0, fPowerNotifyPort= 0xa4ab390\r\nDVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0xa4b1760, fPowerNotifyPort= 0xa4afff0\r\n2011-08-25 18:51:19.391 LayerBackedOpenGLView[12233:707] unlockFocus called too many time.\r\nAssertion failed: (s->stack->next != NULL), function CGGStackRestore, file Context/CGGStack.c, line 116.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n(Go to the downloads section of https://github.com/ewmailing/GLEssentialsPortToCAOpenGLLayer for the sample project.)"
