    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen we restore a backup for the iPhone with iTunes, it shows a modal dialog that is on top of every other active windows. I understand that the restoring process is important, but the UI shouldn't be that intrusive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRestore iPhone from the backup data.\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\nMy suggestion is to display this process on the iTunes HUD that was used for various iTunes activities (such as iPhone sync and backup process). I also suggest to move any iTunes modal progress indicator on that HUD.\r\n\r\nThis will provide some benefits to the users:\r\n1. It presents a unified progress indicator of iTunes activity.\r\n2. It doesn't disrupt the current user activity.\r\n\r\nIt's understandable that in the case where an error happens a modal dialog is important, but a progress indicator doesn't need to be shown in a modal dialog."
