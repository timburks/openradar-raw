    description: "Summary: When writing/modifying code in Xcode the editor does not use spell checking or the system wide auto-correction. This is smart and logical as auto-correct is in deep conflict with code and code's misuse of English (NSSortDescriptor = no-go). \r\n\r\nHowever, for comments auto-correct should be enabled. Developers who cannot spell well may rely on auto-correct and if Xcode used it only for comments it would be helpful and make documentation and comments easier to read as they avoid spelling errors.\r\n\r\nOf significant note is that auto-correct should not conflict with method names, class names, ivar names or syntax. Having auto-correct tell you that NSString is not a word in the comments would not be helpful. That is, the natural language correction should not conflict with machine language namespaces.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Write a comment in a source code file with a spelling error\r\n\r\n//Initailizer method\r\n- (id) init {\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Initailizer would be correct to Initializer.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Spelling errors are not corrected.\r\n\r\nRegression: No regression.\r\n\r\nNotes: Yes, developers should learn to spell. Having auto-correct fix English and other natural language misspellings would be helpful to everyone who has to read documentation and comments with those misspellings."
