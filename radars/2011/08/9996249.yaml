    description: "As seen in the WWDC 2011 session \"Implementing UIViewController Containment\", the UIPageViewController can be embedded within other view controllers instead of taking up the whole screen. However, when it is so embedded, the page curl transition is clipped to the bounds of the UIPageViewController's view. This looks ugly and breaks the user's immersion. \r\n\r\nThe page curl should break out of the UIPageViewController's view's bounds, to render in full without being clipped."
