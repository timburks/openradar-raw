    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSharing movies and TV shows from iTunes to AppleTV should allow for organization into folders which can be then protected individually. The usefulness of this is to create groupings of movies and shows and allowing for protecting some movies while not protecting others. I would like to be able to create a \"Kids\" folder with all the movies my kids can watch and have it be unprotected. Then a folder with movies for the adults that is protected. Later I would add a \"older kids\" folder as my kids get older and the younger ones couldn't get into that folder. \r\n\r\nThis goes beyond the password level based on moving Rating. As it stands, there are several animated movies my kids can watch that at PG, but there are many other movies in my collection that are PG that I don't want my kids watching.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking an interface much like organizing apps on iOS devices in iTunes, but for managing how movies are organized when viewed by the AppleTV (or anything connecting via Home Sharing). Then being able to set a pin code for each folder."
