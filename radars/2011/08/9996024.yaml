    description: "Summary: Using the ARC converter nerves shows diff preview for me, even using empty projects created in Xcode 4.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  \r\n\r\n- Create a new project in Xcode 4.1 \r\n- Make *no* modification to the project\r\n- Open that project in Xcode 4.2\r\n- Convert the project to ARC\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The preview of changes shows up.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The preview of changes is empty.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: Creating a new project in Xcode 4.2 without using ARC will show diff preview, but that's the only I saw the diff preview.\r\n\r\nAttached a screenshot of the result with a 4.1-created project.\r\n\r\nAttached a standard project template provided by Xcode 4.1 that fail to show diff in the ARC conversion."
