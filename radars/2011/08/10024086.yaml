    description: "Summary: When updating an application on device (iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad), the application update process can appear to complete but launching the application afterwards fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: With an app installed on device, use the App Store application to install an update to the application. (app) had this happen frequently with our users. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: Application is downloaded, \"Loading...\" completes and tapping on the app icon launches the new app successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \"Loading...\" behavior completes, and tapping on the icon shows default.png and the application immediately exist.\r\n\r\nRegression: Probably. With a large number of test users at our company , there are a greater number of users seeing these failures than in the past. \r\n\r\nNotes: Console output is as follows:\r\nAug 24 10:36:15 unknown SpringBoard[30] <Warning>: Killing <SBApplication: 0x1dd9f270> (app)  activate:  deactivate:  for app installation\r\nAug 24 10:36:27 unknown SpringBoard[30] <Warning>: The '(app)' bundle at /private/var/mobile/Applications/3B900258-9F40-46C1-972C-E584E5CE7F7F/(app) does not have an executable path.
