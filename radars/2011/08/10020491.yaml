    description: "In Lion and iOS 5, NSData type attributes in core data models have a new property that allows them to be stored as external files, at the framework's discretion, for performance/size reasons.\r\n\r\nThis feature should extend to Transformable types which are often used for storing large-ish amounts of data.\r\n\r\nFor example, since the \"data\" binding of NSImageView is deprecated, the usual way to store a small NSImage in core data is to use a Transformable type with a simple transformer class to convert NSImage to and from NSData, which means the core data property can be bound to the \"value\" binding of NSImageView.\r\n\r\nThis means that these NSImages are still not able to be stored externally."
