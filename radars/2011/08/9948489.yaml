    description: "12-Aug-2011 07:11 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\nI am trying to get layer backing to work with OpenGL on Lion. I just filed 9948466 which is related.\r\nAs a work around, instead of layer backed views, I went to CAOpenGLLayer hoping it would work better. While this doesn't freeze my system, I only get garbage rendered in my views.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is my modified example. Build and run it and you will see garbage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould look like the original example.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGarbage\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is possible I didn't port the example correctly. It is also quick and dirty. \r\nIf the example is not ported correctly, I would appreciate any guidance on what's wrong.  A new developer example showing CAOpenGLLayer with the modern OpenGL engine would be nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12-Aug-2011 07:12 PM Eric Wing:\r\nForgot to mention, I'm seeing OpenGL errors when I switch to CALayers/layer backed, e.g.\r\n\r\n\r\n2011-08-12 19:04:40.688 MacGLEssentials[1259:707] NVIDIA GeForce 320M OpenGL Engine 3.2 NVIDIA-7.2.9\r\n[Switching to process 1259 thread 0x707]\r\n2011-08-12 19:04:43.946 MacGLEssentials[1259:707] GLError GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION set in File:/Users/ewing/Downloads/GLEssentials/Classes/OpenGLRenderer.m Line:1093\r\n\r\n15-Aug-2011 01:01 PM Eric Wing:\r\nI've been injecting more glGetError()'s into the code which has led me to start calling glCheckFramebufferStatus(). In several places, such as glClear() around line 260, and I'm getting GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNDEFINED. My current speculation is the default FBO=0 is failing for CAOpenGLLayer.\r\n\r\nAccording to the sample code:\r\n\t// Init our renderer.  Use 0 for the defaultFBO which is appropriate for MacOS (but not iOS)\r\n\t_renderer = [[OpenGLRenderer alloc] initWithDefaultFBO:0];\r\n\r\n\r\nBut maybe this is a bug with layer backed views and CAOpenGLLayer?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate feedback if this seems right. Also, I would really like to know what the fix/workaround for this is. I really need to get CALayer's going because I need to superimpose other widgets on my OpenGL layer/view."
