    description: "Summary:\r\nNo way to gain access to the serial ports (/dev/cu.yourserialdevice) when using App Sandboxing\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use same techniques to open a serial port as in SerialPortSample http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/SerialPortSample/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10000454\r\n\r\n2. Enable Entitlements & App Sandboxing, set all entitlements to allow and read/write\r\n\r\n3. Start the app, try to connect to the device: you can't access the device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Be able to access the device on /dev/ if you have the entitlement for \"Allow USB Access\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Unable to access the device on /dev/\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Problem occurs when App Sandboxing is enabled\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I write Mac Apps that communicate with Arduino. We have an App on the Mac App Store, \"Meters for Arduino\", so we need sandboxing for serial devices to be able to work\r\n- Serial devices are still widely used, so support is still relevant and important\r\n- No workarounds yet\r\n- Please fix this! :("
