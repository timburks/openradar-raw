    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using iCloud backup, iOS devices do not automatically backup to iTunes when syncing. However, some users, including myself, prefer to keep iTunes backups (which are then rolled into Time Machine backups for additional safekeeping) rather than simply relying on iCloud. The reason for this is simple: reinstalling all data and apps over Wi-Fi is slow, and media has to be re-synced after a restore anyway, so there is no reason to bother restoring from an iCloud backup if you'll still have to reconnect to iTunes to sync your non-iTunes store media. Otherwise, you get stuck downloading several gigabytes of data, leaving your device unusable for hours (or in some cases, maybe even a day or two). That is simply not acceptable for people who rely on their devices daily.\r\n\r\nYes, there is a backup button in the right-click menu of the iOS device in the iTunes source list, but that is easy to forget about, and many people do not know it exists. The obvious solution, in my opinion, would be to add a \"Backup\" button alongside the \"Restore\" and \"Update\" buttons. More people would see it and use it there.\r\n\r\n05-Oct-2011 12:42 AM Mike Beasley:\r\nSolved in the latest version\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
