    description: "Summary: When TimeMachine (over the network) was running when you put the machine to sleep, on wake the wifi will not reconnect, and the network pref pane will hang until the TM disk is unmounted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n* Set up the machine to use TimeMachine over WiFi.\r\n* Initiate a backup.\r\n* Close the lid while the backup is running.\r\n* Wait for the machine to go to sleep.\r\n* Wake the machine from sleep.\r\n* The WiFi will not reconnect to the network.\r\n* Open Network Preferences \r\n* Click \"Turn Wi-Fi Off\"\r\n* Beach ball of death appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect WiFi connectivity to be unrelated to TimeMachine backups.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs long as the TimeMachine volume is mounted, the WiFi will not reconnect.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorked as expected in 10.6.8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis actually stops you from working, and it can last several minutes. It is severely hampering."
