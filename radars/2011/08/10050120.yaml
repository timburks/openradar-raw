    description: "31-Aug-2011 10:06 AM Aidan Steele:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe modern Objective-C runtime allows for instance variables to be synthesized rather than declared directly in the class' interface. These variables are not viewable in the \"Variable View\" of the \"Debug Area\" in Xcode, whereas explicitly-declared instance variables are.\r\n\r\nThe above situation makes using synthesized instance variables cumbersome as debugging them can be a pain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSynthesized instance variables are treated no differently than explicitly-declared instance variables by Xcode's debugger GUI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSynthesized instance variables ARE treated differently than explicitly-declared instance variables by Xcode's debugger GUI"
