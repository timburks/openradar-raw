    description: "I've an iPhone only app that when run on iPad device in 1x/2x mode jumps 20 pixels or so upwards (about the size of a status bar) when resuming the app. It does it on a default Xcode \"Navigation based application\" template app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create \"Navigation based application\" project (or use attached zipped example)\r\n2. Run on iPad\r\n3. Press home button and wait a few seconds\r\n4. Resume app - observe view jump up about 20 pixels. Sometimes doesn't happen if pause wasn't long enough, in which case retry step 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShouldn't jump!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nJumps!\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt seems to affect other iPhone apps on iPad such as OmniFocus (iPhone app). There is a similar weird view layout problem when run on iPad simulator but it's not easy to see in this example project.\r\n\r\nCompiling on Xcode 3.2.6/Snow Leopard and running on iPad with iOS 4.3.5."
