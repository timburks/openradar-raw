    description: "Summary:\r\nAssuming you have a Filevault encrypted volume connected to your Mac : If you launch the Disk Utility of the Recovery Partition, the selected keyboard layout in the Menu Bar is not used when I type the password to unlock the volume. The app overrides my selection (French, so I have an AZERTY keyboard) and is using a QWERTY layout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boot the Mac on the Recovery Partition.\r\n2. Launch Disk Utility app.\r\n3. Select your FileVault volume in the disks list.\r\n4. Click on the button \"Unlock\" in the toolbar.\r\n5. A popup is displayed and asks you to type the password of the Volume.\r\n6. Choose \"French\" as Input source in the Menu Bar.\r\nNote that the French Flag icon well appears.\r\n7. Type the FileVault password of the selected volume.\r\n8. A message appears to indicate that the password is wrong. \r\n9. The Flag Icon in the menu bar switches automatically to the English Input source.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeing able to type my password using the selected keyboard layout in the Menu Bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf my password contains characters who are at different places on an AZERTY and a QWERTY keyboard, I always type a wrong password.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug with the keyboard layout seems to only appear with password fields. I tried other fields (for example, the field to type the name of a partition) without this kind of problem."
