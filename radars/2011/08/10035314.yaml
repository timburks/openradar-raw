    description: "Summary:\r\nAutomatic Termination is supposed to only close applications that have no windows open. However, if an application is not running and you open a document from the Finder, Automatic Termination may quit the application if the document doesn't load fast enough.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Find a large movie file, so that it takes a while to load. (If you have an SSD, put the file on an HD instead.) Make sure QuickTime isn't running.\r\n1. Open the file.\r\n2. As soon as QuickTime puts its menu up, activate another app by clicking on another window.\r\n3. Wait.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movie opens in the background and stays there. I can switch to QuickTime whenever I want.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe movie window flashes on the screen (behind the current application), then QuickTime quits. There are no messages in the Console and no crash logs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHappened in 10.7.0 also, N/A before that.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince quitting via Automatic Termination still removes an app from the Dock and the Cmd-Tab switcher, it's not necessarily easy to re-open the application and restore the state you wanted to have anyway.\r\n\r\nSince applications stay resident in memory even after being automatically terminated, you may have to restart or use the `purge` command to reproduce it after QuickTime has already been opened and closed once.\r\n\r\nI've gotten this to happen with Preview and large PDFs as well, but it's less easy to reproduce."
