    description: "Summary:\r\nThe delegate method -textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString: is not always called, which makes the delegate method unreliable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Pick a UITextField with a good chunk of text in it.\r\n- Start removing text by pressing-and-holding Backspace.\r\n- Hold on long enough for the system to go into whole-word-deletion-mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe -textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString: delegate method to be invoked with the NSRange argument indicating the range of the words being removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe -textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString: delegate method is not called at all during this \"deletion mode\". Just like deleting single characters, inserting text, replacing selections and cutting and pasting, I'd expect the deletion of whole words to inform the delegate about it, too.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n—\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n—"
