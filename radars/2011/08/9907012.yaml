    description: "Summary:\r\nAn improbable but very possible sequence of user-input commands will cause iPhoto 9.1.5 to be unusable until its next launch, and possibly until the 2nd next one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGenerate a \"Places\"-themed slideshow -- iPhoto will enter the \"Downloading Maps\" phase locking out the sidebar; enter Full Screen mode (tested with keyboard shortcut) and exit it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSidebar getting unlocked immediately / after download completes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhoto never unlocks the sidebar until its next start. The user is unable to get back to the slideshow page since slideshows are not available in full screen mode.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached crash was generated after re-accessing that slideshow immediately after quitting iPhoto due to the above mentioned problem."
