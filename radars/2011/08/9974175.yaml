    description: "Summary: UIDevice class could have a property to know if the current device has cellular data capabilities.\r\n\r\nNotes: For example, I have a toggle named \"Download updates only on WiFi\". That toggle is shown to every user, whether or not their device can have cellular data. That would be nice to know if the device can go online on cellular radio, to avoid showing a useless preference."
