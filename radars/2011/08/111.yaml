    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be great if the compiler could automatically import needed headers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite some code and forget to import a header.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe compiler would see that the needed header is available and automatically import it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nObviously if a header was already present, it should not automatically load one. This would solve edge cases like categories and such where collisions could occur.\r\n\r\nThis would be a really nice improvement and save many developers a lot of time and headache."
