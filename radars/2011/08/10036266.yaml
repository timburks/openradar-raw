    description: "Summary: When using the \"Extract\" refactoring tool, you should be able to add a space at the begging of the new method name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Select the part you want to extract. Use the extract refactoring tool. Change the proposed name to something like this : \r\n\r\n- (void) addMainItems:(NSMenu *)appMenu\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The method declaration is valid, so it should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The method declaration is not accepted, is ask to remove the space like this : \r\n\r\n- (void)addMainItems:(NSMenu *)appMenu\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: That's my coding style, that's why I care! :)"
