    description: "21-Apr-2011 06:16 PM Eric Wing:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPlease add Lua support to Xcode.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, syntax highlighting is needed.\r\n\r\nMore ambitious are things like auto-completion. If it is any help, there is a llvm-lua project at:\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/llvm-lua/\r\n\r\nLua is the dominant scripting language used used in the games industry. This would really help all the game developers from World of Warcraft to Angry Birds to Bubble Ball.\r\n\r\nThere are also two Lua/Obj-C bridges out there:\r\nLuaCocoa (http://playcontrol.net/opensource/LuaCocoa)\r\nLua Wax https://github.com/probablycorey/wax\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThere used to be a syntax highlighting file for Lua for pre-Xcode 4, but it doesn't work with Xcode 4."
