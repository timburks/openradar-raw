    description: "iCloud.com contains a viewer for iWork documents. This is good.\r\n\r\nI would like similar functionality to be enabled for developers. Apple should provide a set of WebObjects java classes to handle fetching and syncing the currently logged in user's iCloud documents with a web app. Then, developers write a WebObjects application to do any editing they desire. This web application is submitted for review through iTunes Connect, and (assuming it passes review) it is then installed on iCloud.com. \r\n\r\nFrom the user's perspective, the custom viewer/editor web apps only show up once the user has already used a specific iCloud app on the Mac or their iOS device. Once they've synced some files to iCloud in this manner, if the developer of the app has written a web app for it, a new icon appears on their iCloud display."
