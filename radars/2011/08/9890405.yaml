    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFirst, let me say Xcode is great and you've done a lot of great work to make Xcode 4 an excellent development platform! But Xcode is failing us when it comes using static libs and sharing code. The best documentation I've found is on an external site http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/04/04/using-open-source-static-libraries-in-xcode-4/ Look how many steps it takes to create a static lib and share that code!\r\n\r\nIt is incredibly frustrating that the only way I can add a file, project or workspspace xcode is using a mouse. We are developers and we need more control over our project management! I should be able to do this via the command-line or through some public Xcode API.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry and maintain a static lib from within a separate project. It is far too complicated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA public API for developers to script Xcode (add files to groups, update build settings, create and update schemes, etc) \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode doesn't let me do any project management automation."
