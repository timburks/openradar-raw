    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a link-local IPv6 address is configured name resolution fails. The lookup / connection times out \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Configure only a link-local IPv6 DNS server\r\n2. Try to resolve a hostname\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe hostname to be resolved\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe lookup times out\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn my case the link local IPv6 address is provided by the RA via RDNSS. I guess that the OS X resolver fails to determine the interface to use for the lookup. When i have my radvd advertise the global IP of the DNS server it works fine. Manually performing a lookup with 'dig' against the link-local IP also works fine, if the interface is specified (IP%en0)."
