    description: "23-Aug-2011 11:11 AM Chris DeSalvo:\r\n'Screenshots.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n23-Aug-2011 11:11 AM Chris DeSalvo:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a machine is configured with multiple email accounts iPhoto will present a pop-up menu to let you select which address to use as the \"from\" for the photos.  However, at least on my machine, it sends the email from the wrong account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0.  This was on a Lion machine, so get one of those and set it up with several email accounts.  In my case I have 7.\r\n\r\n1.  Select a photo.\r\n\r\n2.  Click the 'Share' button in the bottom right.\r\n\r\n3.  Choose an email address from the accounts pop-up menu\r\n\r\n4.  Fill in the rest of the form and send the email\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn my case I selected address 2 from the list of 7.  I expected that that address would be the 'from' address of the email that was sent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe email was sent with the 'from' field set to the value of the third address in the list.  This was 100% reproducible with 7 test messages.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI do not have a version of iPhoto earlier than 9.1.5 to regress.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached screenshots showing the options available to me, the option I chose, and the resulting email."
