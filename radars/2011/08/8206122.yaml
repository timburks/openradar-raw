    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen I drag folders/groups around in the navigation browser, they always expand on drop.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDrag a folder from part of the navigation browser and drop it into another\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe folder moves, maintaining its expanding/collapsing state.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe folder moves, and then is expanded.  When doing a project cleanup, this results in having to collapse folders all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nXcode3 preserved folder expansion state.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOnce radar allows attachment uploads again, I will attach a movie showing the problem."
