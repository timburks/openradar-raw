    description: "Summary: When you use the \"Extract\" refactoring tool, it would be nice that the extracted method was added to the class extension of the refactored class if present.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Extract a method. Place the method implementation after the first call in the class. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: The refactoring tool as added the method in the class extension, so no error occurs.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No method declaration has been added, so a compilation error occurs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
