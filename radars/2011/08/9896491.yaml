    description: "04-Aug-2011 08:22 AM David Tseng:\r\nSummary: Enable developers to add accessibility to objective C classes that do not inherit from a NSView subclass.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Within a objective C application,\r\n2.  attempt to implement NSAccessibility protocol on an object inheriting from NSObject (either directly or indirectly), but not from NSView (directly or indirectly).\r\n3.  fire accessibility events on this object using\r\nNSAccessibilityPostNotification().\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClients such as VoiceOver can observe for notifications on this element.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEvents cannot be observed.\r\n\r\nRegression: No\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNSAccessibilityUnregisterUniqueIdForUIElement (which has been discussed on various public mailing lists), explicitly registers an element with AppKit, but is SPI. It does workaround this bug however."
