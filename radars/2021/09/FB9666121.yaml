    description: "WindowServer consumes ca. 5-10% CPU with Activity Monitor in foreground.\r\nWindowServer consumes ca. 40% CPU  with Podcast in foreground.\r\n\r\nWhat causes the WindowServer to run ca. +30% CPU with Podcast in foreground?\r\n- Text Marquee effect on top of the window?\r\n- Loudness/playback animation below the show that currently plays?\r\n\r\nAnyways it seems too much that such minimal animation causes that high CPU.\r\n- This should not stress the CPU much, but only the GPU.\r\n- Please investigate. Thanks!"
