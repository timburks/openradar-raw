    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nFiles app fails to open local files from shareddocuments url scheme\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nFiles app\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nHow often does this happen?\r\nIt happens every time\r\n\r\nWhen you see this issue, where are the files located that you are using?\r\nSomething else not on this list\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nOpening a file using the shareddocuments:// url scheme no longer shows the specified file.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of iOS you could construct a url that would open the Files app to a specified file. `shareddocuments://` + `path to file`.\r\n\r\nIn recent versions of iOS (14.6+, 15 beta 3+) the Files app is launched, but the specified file is no longer shown. This worked in iOS 14.5 and earlier.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- Open attached xcode project (FilesAppTest)\r\n- Run project in simulator running iOS 14.5\r\n- Tap \"Show in Files\" button\r\n- Files app should be launched and file shown (previous case)\r\n- Run project in simulator running iOS 15 beta+\r\n- Tap \"Show in Files\" button\r\n- Files app should be launched, but file NOT shown (regression case)\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nFiles app is launched and specified file shown\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nFiles app is launched, but specified file NOT shown\r\n\r\nTested with some other people and we’ve narrowed down the issue:\r\n- Works for files and folders stored in iCloud Drive\r\n- Works for folders stored in “On My iPad/iPhone”\r\n- Doesn’t work for files stored in “On My iPad/iPhone”\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\nhttps://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/doppler-1f163.appspot.com/o/FilesAppTest.zip?alt=media&token=85cdce7b-07af-4400-8790-f78530fb5b27"
