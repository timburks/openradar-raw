    description: "When submitting a build to App Store Connect, my build numbering scheme includes the date the build was created to ensure that the numbers are unique and march forward in time. The format of these build strings is as follows \"year.month.dayhourminutesecond\". You can see in the attached screenshot that previous builds in this format have rendered correctly, but the most recent one which was submitted as \"2021.09.28232653\" has been rounded to \"2022\". You can view the build value showing correctly on the submitted archive within my organizer\r\n\r\nIt appears this is in display (as far as I can tell) only. Downloading the app through TestFlight I see the correct build number (which is also baked into my app). \r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell the \"2022\" is not computed on the front end and is instead returned in the RPC call as \"2022\" \r\n\r\nMore context in Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/brianmichel/status/1443221421673615361"
