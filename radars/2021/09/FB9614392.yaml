    description: "An inline date picker using GraphicalDatePickerStyle does not receive touches when a parent view has a TapGesture added to it. \r\n\r\nI expected that using .simultaneousGesture should allow the date picker to receive touches.\r\n\r\nThe picker will not allow changing  selection when tapping normally. The selection is only changed when using a long tap. \r\n\r\nThis affects changing days as well as changing months using the back and forward buttons. Scrolling the months sideways works, as does tapping the name of the month to select month or year using the wheelpicker.\r\n\r\nI attached a SwiftUI View demonstrating this problem in live preview or running on a simulator.\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\n// File attached in original request starting here\r\n\r\nimport SwiftUI\r\n\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n    @State var date: Date = Date()\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            // DatePicker working normally\r\n            DatePicker(\"\", selection: $date, displayedComponents: [.date])\r\n                .datePickerStyle(GraphicalDatePickerStyle())\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            VStack {\r\n                // DatePicker broken due to the simultaneousTapGesture\r\n                DatePicker(\"\", selection: $date, displayedComponents: [.date])\r\n                    .datePickerStyle(GraphicalDatePickerStyle())\r\n            }\r\n            .simultaneousGesture(TapGesture().onEnded({ _ in\r\n                print(\"Tap\")\r\n            }))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\r\n    static var previews: some View {\r\n        ContentView()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// File end"
