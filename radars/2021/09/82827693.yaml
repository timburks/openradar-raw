    description: "Setup:\r\nWe create an ObjC App that uses our SPM package \"RevenueCat\".\r\nIn our app, we create an object that uses an object from the \"RevenueCat\" package as part of its api.\r\n\r\nWe expose this object's header (which exposes the method containing the RevenueCat object as a parameter) as a public header.\r\n\r\nWe create a Swift test target that depends on the ObjC App and has a bridging header for that object we created.\r\n\r\nWe attempt to use the API in a test. API that doesn't include RevenueCat objects is fine, but any API that uses RevenueCat objects in the parameter is not found.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nXcode 12.5.1 (Build version 12E507) & Xcode 13 Beta 5\r\n\r\nM1 Mac as well as Intel mac.\r\n\r\nSwift Package Manager - Swift 5.4.0\r\n\r\nSwift Package Manager - Swift 5.5.0\r\n\r\nComponent: Package Manager\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReproduction project: https://github.com/taquitos/SPMBug\r\n\r\nAttempt to build the test target. \r\n\r\nYou'll get \r\n`Value of type 'TaquitosAreTheBest' has no member 'purchaserInfo'`"
