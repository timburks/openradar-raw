    description: "After the release of Watch OS 8 and iOS 15, we've had issues with our enterprise app not launching anymore on the watch.\r\n\r\nAfter following the steps here https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682775 and later the official documentation https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/using-the-latest-code-signature-format, we still experience that xcode does not sign the watch and watch extension properly, only the iOS app.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following workarounds:\r\n* Added '--preserve-metadata' and '--generate-entitlement-der' to 'Other code signing flags'\r\n* manually signing\r\n\r\nThe former does not work, watch and extension are still not signed with DER entitlement.\r\nThe latter works but is rather inconvenient.\r\n\r\nMy setup:\r\nMac OS Big Sur - 11.4 (20F71)\r\nXcode 12.5.1 (Still reproducible with Xcode 13)\r\nWatch running WatchOS8\r\niPhone running iOS15\r\n\r\n------- Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue -----------\r\n1. Create small iOS project\r\n2. Add watch and watch extension target\r\n2b. optional step: add --preserve-metadata and --generate-entitlement-der to 'Other Code signing flags'\r\n2. Archive\r\n4. Inspect .ipa\r\n\r\n--------- What did you expect to happen? ------------------\r\niOS app, watch app and extension appex having a -6, -7 in its signature and being able to launch app on watch\r\n\r\n\r\n------------ What actually happened? ------------------\r\nOnly the iOS app has -6, -7 signatures.. watch and extension does not. App on watch does not launch."
