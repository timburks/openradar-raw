    description: "Area:\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen in the Sharing screen of System Preferences, under File Sharing, if you right click on the Users of a Shared Folder, you get a context menu for a shared folder, instead of the user. And not the necessarily the currently selected shared folder.\r\n\r\nI've attached a video of the problem, but I'll try and explain it better here:\r\n\r\nUnder File Sharing, there are two tables. The first is \"Shared Folders\", that lists each folder on the system that is currently being shared. The second is \"Users\", that shows the users and their permissions for the folder selected the first table.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Shared Folders table in my video shows 'Backups, Backups2, Cerebral Gardens, etc'. If you select 'Backups', then the Users table updates to show which users have permissions for the 'Backups' folder. Select 'Backups2' and the users update.\r\n\r\nNow, right click on 'Backups', and you'll see a context menu with options 'Show in Finder', 'Apply Permissions to Enclosed Items', 'Get Info', and 'Advanced Options'. Select 'Get Info', and you'll see a dialog with info about 'Backups'. This is all correct so far. Here's were it breaks. With 'Backups' selected, right click on the first user in the User list. You get the context menu for the shared folder 'Backups'. Not a menu for the user you've selected. Now it gets worse. Right click on the second user. So this is the second user in the list for the first shared folder. You get a context menu for the second shared folder. Which isn't even selected. Third user gives you the context menu for the third folder. If there happens to be more users with permissions on a folder than the number of shared folders, right clicking on that user won't give you any context menu.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen System Preferences on a mac with High Sierra on it (actually reproducible on El Capitan [10.11.6 15G1510] as well, maybe earlier). Go to Sharing, and File Sharing. Select the first shared folder in the Shared Folders table. Then select the second user in the users table, right click it and select 'Get Info'. See the details for the second shared folder, rather than the user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould probably see details about the user you've right clicked. Or the easy fix is just don't show the context menu at all in the User's table.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou see, and can act upon the wrong items.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 (17E202)\r\n\r\nNote: Migrated to FB5352848\r\n\r\nVideo attachment on YouTube: https://youtu.be/BCmluG9BgAQ"
