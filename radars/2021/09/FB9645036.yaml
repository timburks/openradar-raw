    description: "- A clear description of the problem\r\nWe are trying to get a square image of a PHAsset with PHImageManager. The result image should be the center square of the image. We are using a method PHImageManager.requestImage(for:targetSize:contentMode:options:resultHandler:) , described in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phimagemanager/1616964-requestimage . However, it doesn't return the target size image in iOS 15, although it works fine in older OSs.  \r\n\r\n- A step-by-step set of instructions to reproduce the problem (if possible)\r\n1. prepare a PHAsset of non-square such as 4032x3024.\r\n2. initialize options like\r\n```\r\nlet options = PHImageRequestOptions()\r\noptions.resizeMode = .exact\r\noptions.deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat\r\noptions.isNetworkAccessAllowed = true\r\noptions.progressHandler = { (progress, _, _, _) in\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. request the image with PHImageManager like\r\n```\r\nPHImageManager.default()\r\n            .requestImage(for: asset,\r\n                          targetSize: CGSize(width: 1536, height: 1536),\r\n                          contentMode: .aspectFill,\r\n                          options: options,\r\n                          resultHandler: { (image, info) in\r\n                  // the size of image returned here is 2048.0 * 1536.0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. the returned image is not square as mentioned in the previous step. \r\n\r\n- What results you expected\r\nI'm expecting the size of the returned image is 1536 * 1536.\r\n\r\n- What results you actually saw\r\nthe image is returned with the size of 2048.0 * 1536.0"
