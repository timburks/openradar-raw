    description: "Created empty macOS project\r\nSigning & Capabilities / Team - personal team\r\nSigning & Capabilities / Signing certificate - set to \"Sign to Run Locally\"\r\n\r\nThe app requests Screen Capture permission in its root view controller's viewDidLoad:\r\n\r\nCGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()\r\n\r\nSystem dialog pops up, open System prefs,\r\nCheck the checkbox next to the application's name in System Preferences window.\r\nSelect Later button in popup dialog.\r\n\r\nRebuild the app, Screen Capture permission is granted.\r\n\r\nModify the code by adding a new line under CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess():\r\nprint(\"modified\")\r\n\r\nRebuild and run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected: \r\nThe app should still have the Screen Capture privilege granted. Or if it is withdrawn, the System Preferences window should show it correctly.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe request pop up appears again, and acts like if the permission was never granted. System Preferences shows that the app still has the permission. Permission can be regranted by checking out and back in again the permission checkbox."
