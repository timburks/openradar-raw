    description: "Inside of a Siri Shortcut I have a custom enum with a list of music streaming services including Apple Music, Spotify etc etcâ€¦\r\n\r\nXcode correctly builds this app and also validates it before sending the binary to App Store connect for a test flight beta. After sending the binary to App Store Connect I receive an email saying the binary was invalid due to the following reason:\r\n\r\nITMS-90626: Invalid Siri Support - Custom enum value display name 'Apple Music' cannot contain 'apple'\r\n\r\nAfter requesting code level Technical Support from Apple they said that this is most likely a bug and to file a bug report.
