    description: "In our app we are implementing WebAuthn support via a webauthn api provided by WebKit - we open a ASWebAuthenticationSession with our website that offers to sign in with a WebAuthn credential (biometric auth). After authenticating with TouchID the overlay stays on the screen forever and the app is not resposive, the home button on this iPhone 7 does not react. This is a regression from iOS 14.\r\n\r\n(attached a video description of the problem)"
