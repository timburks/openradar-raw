    description: "The problem and steps for reproducing it:\r\n(1) A NSUserActivity object, userActivity, is created with [\"url\":some local file url] as its userInfo dictionary.  \r\n(2) UIApplication's requestSceneSessionActivation(_:userActivity:options:errorHandler:) is called with userActivity as the NSUserActivity parameter.  \r\n(3) When the app's sceneDelegate's scene(_:willConnectTo:options:) processes that sceneActivation request, the userActivity's url-containing userInfo is missing.\r\n\r\nWhat's expected: the url-containing userInfo of the userActivity parameter used for the sceneActivation request should still be present when that request is processed by the sceneDelegate's scene(_:willConnectTo:options:).\r\n\r\nThis behavior appears in the latest versions of iPadOS (14.6) and Mac Catalyst (running on the latest version of Big Sur, 11.4).\r\n\r\nA clarification on step (3) above: when I say, \"the userActivity's url-containing userInfo is missing,\" I simply mean that the userInfo dictionary contains no entries (and, in particular, not the url).\r\n\r\nAlso, there appears to be no problem if the userInfo dictionary has other types only; but as long as at least one of the entries in the initially created userInfo dictionary is for a local file URL, inspection of the userInfo dictionary in the sceneDelegate's willConnectTo method reveals that dictionary to have *zero* entries."
