    description: "It’s a weird quirk that playing audio in an app in the Xcode Simulator affects the audio output from Mac apps, but it’s a serious bug that running an iOS app on an m1 Mac does the same.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce.\r\n- Install the iOS version of the podcast app Overcast (I don’t think it matters what app you use, as long as it can play audio).\r\n- Play the “Springloaded” video in Safari, make sure you can hear the audio.\r\n- Open Overcast for iOS on the Mac, you don’t need to play anything in Overcast.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- Neither app’s audio is affected by the other.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n- The sound playing in Safari is severely degraded.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens when using the Simulator,."
