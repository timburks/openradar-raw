    description: "In our app we use AVSpeechSynthesizer to speak navigation directions. Our Dutch users notice that many of the utterances glitch, where it seems to speak a random '-' in-between the text. \r\n\r\nThis is reproducible by simply speaking this text on a Dutch AVSpeechSynthesisVoice:  \"Over 300 meter houd rechts aan richting Breda.\" (which means \"In 300 meters, keep right towards Breda.\"). It glitches on the word 'aan'. \r\n\r\nReproducible only on-device, as the Xcode simulator doesn't seem to have this issue. Tested on iOS 14.4 and 14.6, where both have this issue. Attached is a small project that reproduces the issue when run on-device and pressing the button on-screen. The issue is very obvious to hear. \r\n\r\nTexts that also have this issue: \r\n- \"Over 900 meter houd rechts aan en blijf op Muntweg.\"\r\n- \"Houd rechts aan.\""
