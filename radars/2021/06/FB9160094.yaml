    description: "Seems like in iOS 15 Notes.app and others system apps have access to Contacts profile picture when collaborating in a document. We would like to have a way to show the collaborators profile picture in our apps. \r\n\r\nI think including the profile picture in a secure way in CKUserIdentity is the best way, since the user grant us permission to access their information when discovering their identities anyways [e.g. CKDiscoverAllUserIdentitiesOperation].\r\n\r\nJust for reference attached an screenshot on the Notes feature I am referring to. Having access to users Apple ID would really give a sense of integration with the system in our Apps, and provides helpful visual clues when it comes to sharing in our apps."
