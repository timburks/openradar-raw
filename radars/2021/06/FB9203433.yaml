    description: "Hi I use the following command:\r\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool YES;\r\n\r\nTo display the full path of the folder in the Finder window title. When a long path is shown it is displayed using tail truncation, it would be more useful to me if it used head truncation so I can view the immediate parent folders instead of the root parent folders.\r\n\r\nFor example instead of the window showing this title:\r\n/Users/mh/Documents/Finance/…\r\n\r\nI would rather see:\r\n…/Finance/Banking/Bank of America\r\n\r\nI do understand I can mouse over to expand the title to show the full path (by the way it appears grey in beta 1 but perhaps is an issue with my VMWare Fusion) but I think it would be an improvement if I could see the immediate parent folders at a glance. Hope you consider my suggestion for the new macOS Monterey, thanks for reading and have a great day!"
