    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operationqueue/1417849-cancelalloperations\r\n\r\nCurrently neither the documentation for cancelAllOperations nor addBarrierBlock indicates that barrier blocks added using `addBarrierBlock` will no longer execute if `cancelAllOperations` is used. I spent more time than I would have liked to discover this, so I propose this should be documented to save others' time."
