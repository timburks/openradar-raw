    description: "GCVirtualController does not display a “Menu” button, even it is initialized with a configuration that includes the element name GCInputButtonMenu. This is a problem for games that use all MFi buttons and also use the controller’s Menu button to pause the game, such as my own app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Initialize GCVirtualControllerConfiguration\r\n2) Add “GCInputButtonMenu” to the GCVirtualControllerConfiguration’s elements.\r\n3) Initialize GCVirtualController with the configuration\r\n4) Call GCVirtualController.connect()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA virtual controller appears with a Menu button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe virtual controller does not display a Menu button.\r\n\r\nHacky Workaround:\r\nBecause GCVirtualController adds a view which blocks user input to the rest of the app, it’s impossible to work around this without manually adding a custom button as a subview of the private GCControllerView. Allowing user input to pass through the controller view would make this workaround somewhat better."
