    description: "This is using Xcode 13 beta 1 and iOS 15 beta. \r\n\r\nIf I use an AttributedString initializer with Markdown to create a Text object in SwiftUI, any and all line spaces will be removed from the resulting view. However, if I create a Text object with markdown directly in the string, it will render the line space as expected. \r\n\r\nIn the screenshot, the top (Hello World) line includes the AttributedString. The line breaks are not rendered at all here. The bottom line includes markdown directly in the Text initializer and renders the line break without issue. \r\n\r\nI've included a simple Xcode project to demonstrate this.  \r\n\r\nProject Github Repo: https://github.com/rwgrier/feedback-FB9190672"
