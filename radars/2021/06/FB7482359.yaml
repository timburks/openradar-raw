    description: "# Issue\r\n\r\nAfter importing photos (.NEF + .JPG) from an SD card, space on the device is permanently consumed. The Storage section of Settings shows that the device has plenty of space, however new photos cannot be imported over the available space reported in the Files app (different than what is reported in Settings > Storage).\r\n\r\n# Reproduction steps\r\n\r\n- Enable iCloud photos\r\n- Import photos from an SD card using either the lighting to SD card adapter on iPhone, or a USB-C SD card reader on iPad\r\n- Wait for photos to upload to iCloud and remove themselves from the iOS/iPadOS device, clearing the storage used in Settings > Storage\r\n- Check the On my iPhone/iPad section of the Files app and see that the available storage reported there is different than that reported in Settings > Storage\r\n- Try to import a batch of photos larger than the reported storage in the Files app, but smaller than the available storage in Settings > Storage. You will receive a popup saying that there is not enough available storage, despite Settings > Storage saying there is.\r\n\r\n# Mitigation\r\n\r\nThe only current mitigation I've found to work is to completely restore the device.\r\n\r\n# Affected OS versions\r\n\r\n- iOS 13.0-15.0\r\n- iPadOS 13.0-15.0"
