    description: "I'd like to provide the ability for users to pinch/zoom on a SwiftUI `ScrollView` for my custom content (it's a tree of nodes). Think like maps allows you to pinch and zoom in one gesture, where as you pan the content stays under your fingers, keeping you connected to it. This gesture feels so natural that when it's different it feels completely broken. Unfortunately I haven't found a way to provide this experience in SwiftUI.\r\n\r\nWe have `MagnificationGesture` but this doesn't supply `translation` information. Combining a `DragGesture` doesn't work either. If we had a single gesture that provided magnification and translation information then I think we could accomplish the behaviour users expect.\r\n\r\nThere is a related post on the forums from last year here https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/651115"
