I'd like to test whether die View has the expected elements and whether interaction with these element results in the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Create a new SwiftUI project.\r\n2. Add some SwiftUI code.\r\n3. Try to inspect the body of a SwiftUI view from within a unit test.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expected there is a special accessor that returns the view hierarchy in a dictionary or an array that can be inspected in a unit test.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nI could not figure out how to access and inspect SwiftUI components.\r\n\r\nWhy this is important: https://dasdom.dev/posts/testing-the-untestable/"
