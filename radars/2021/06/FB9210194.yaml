    description: "Please describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nWhen using SwiftUI's new AsyncImage component in a List containing more cells than can display on screen, it does not display its image when scrolling to cells that were initially off-screen (each image is unique). Its phase's error immediately returns 'cancelled' without attempting to fetch and display the image. When attempting to scroll back up to cells that were initially rendered, the images in those cells are gone, and those image's phases are also 'cancelled'.\r\n\r\nThe above behaviour does not happen when using AsyncImage in a VStack or HStack (I presume nothing gets recycled in those views.)\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nAsyncImage to fetch and display images when scrolling through a list.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nAsyncImage cancels image requests and does not recover.\r\n\r\nLast tested on Xcode 13 beta 2 / iOS 15 beta 2."
