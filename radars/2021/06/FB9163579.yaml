    description: "As described in the docs .focusedSceneValue modifies this view by injecting a value that you provide for use by other views whose state depends on the focused scene.\r\nOne of the aims is to make available to the Scene commands some way to change the Scene view states. However it doesn't work. These value are always nil, as if the view that is modified by  .focusedSceneValue isn't in a Scene with focus.\r\nThe same happens if another view of the Scene tries to retrieve the value with @FocusedValue. In the code sample that I've attached a Button will execute the closure that is the value being shared. But if the Button is pressed with a keyboard shortcut @FocusedValue will be nil."
