    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nThe generated Swift code for types in .intentdefinition files causes build warnings about unnecessary casts. Since the generated code files are managed by Xcode and automatically overwritten, this can't be fixed on the app developer's end.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nOpen and build the attached sample project, or follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new iOS app project\r\n2. Add a new SiriKit Intent Definition file\r\n3. Add a new type to the .intentdefinition file\r\n4. Build\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nThere should be no build warnings.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe warning \"Forced cast of 'Self' to same type has no effect\" is shown three times for the generated Swift file (see attached screenshot)."
