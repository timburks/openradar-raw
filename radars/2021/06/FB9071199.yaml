    description: "I updated to the latest beta version of Xcode and it often fails to build my app, usually when I change the git branch and/or the simulator, but I didn't pay enough attention to know exactly which of these trigger the issue.\r\n\r\nOne example of build failure error is:\r\n> Module file '/Users/revolt/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ModuleCache.noindex/J3JDK8UPXZ4K/Foundation-39SXNSRMYWPGZ.pcm' is out of date and needs to be rebuilt: signature mismatch\r\n\r\nDeleting the `DerivedData` directory fixes it temporarily. It was not happening in Xcode 12.4."
