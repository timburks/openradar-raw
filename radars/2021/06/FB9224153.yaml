    description: "REPRODUCTION\r\n - macOS 11.4 Big Sur\r\n - Finder > Main Menu > Go > Connect to server… (⌘-K)\r\n - Field allows ftps:// scheme. That is FTP in a SSL/TLS tunnel.\r\nSee screenshot: Finder Connect To Server FTPS.png\r\n- Click \"Connect\"\r\n\r\nEXPECTED\r\n- Finder really connects via FTPS\r\n\r\nACTUAL\r\n- Even though you as the user explicitly requested FTPS, Finder actually falls back to FTP silently!\r\n- That is quite a horrible user experience in regards to https://apple.com/privacy/\r\n- I checked this via Wireshark.org !\r\nSee screenshot: FTPS address input in Finder is actually handled as plain FTP without telling the user.png\r\n\r\nAPPLE DOCUMENTATION / FEEDBACK\r\n - macOS 11 documentation on [Network address formats and protocols on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/network-address-formats-and-protocols-on-mac-mchlp1654/11.0/mac/11.0) just says:\r\n  > From the Finder, you can connect to FTP servers only with read-only access. To copy files to an FTP server, use an FTP app.\r\n - So the documentation is correct. Promises nothing about FTPS nor mentions it anyhow.\r\n - But Finder accepts FTPS input and transforms it to FTP without any warning!\r\n\r\nPROPOSALS\r\n1. Finder warns \"You requested a secure connection (FTPS), but Finder supports only unencrypted FTP!\"\r\n[ Cancel ] [Use unsafe FTP]\r\n2. The documentation explicitly mentions that FTPS (FTP in a SSL/TLS tunnel) and SFTP (FTP in a SSH) tunnel are not supported by Finder, and that you need 3rd party software for this."
