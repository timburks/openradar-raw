    description: "Swiping using the home bar or switching to an unfocused app in the app switcher opens a ~1 second window in where any contents on the Home Screen below the app become interactive, and any clicks intended for the app get sent to the Home Screen and its contents. Attached is a screen recording demonstrating this with two Reminders widgets and multiple third party and Apple apps. First I show the widgets opening Reminders, then I demonstrate it in Messages, clicking as soon as the app comes into focus, and then demonstrate giving it a second in Settings, and then demonstrate it in TikTok.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\n1) Open the app switcher and select an unfocused app (or swipe using the home bar)\r\n2) Press an area on the screen where something is on your active Home Screen page within a second of the app being refocused\r\n3) The content or app selected on the Home Screen opens\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: \r\nApp to be usable when put into focus\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nA second delay in between focusing and input, with all input in this timeframe going to the Home Screen"
