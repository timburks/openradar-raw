    description: "I am using a tool that generates code for an Xcode project called R.swift. Part of the generation process involves running a compiled executable. The current version of R.swift still uses an executable compiled for x86, so it runs under Rosetta. When I try to run this on my M1 Pro, the following output appears:\r\n\r\nrosetta error: /var/db/oah/279281325309952_279281325309952/88757c77705f5e24c858ee5b89ffc56f541b2a5d209ccfdda08f02e7605a3e61/rswift.aot: attachment of code signature supplement failed: 1\r\n[1]    97552 trace trap  Pods/R.swift/rswift\r\n\r\nThe R.swift project is open source and available here:\r\nhttps://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced by downloading their latest release zip file (5.4.0) and trying to run the \"rswift\" binary on the command line.\r\n\r\nThe machine I'm using is a 2021 16\" MBP with M1 Pro (10 core) and 32 GB memory.\r\n\r\nI reproduced the crash at Mon Nov 15 10:53:02 MST 2021 and immediately started the sysdiagnose."
