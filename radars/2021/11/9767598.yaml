    description: "ASWebAuthenticationSession on Monterey 12.0.1 never completes with the ephemeral web browser session set to true. The browser session doesn't start (the floating browser window won't show up). \r\n\r\nASWebAuthenticationSession starts to work only after a reboot. \r\n\r\nIt was reproduced on different machines, but we don't know what causes the system to get into the state. But whenever your machine got in this state, it's always reproducible\r\n\r\nThe code in question:\r\n\r\nlet session = ASWebAuthenticationSession(url: signinURL, callbackURLScheme: \"...\") { (_, _) in }\r\nsession.prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession = true\r\nsession.presentationContextProvider = delegate\r\nsession.start()"
