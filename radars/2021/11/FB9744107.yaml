    description: "Original Entry, Nov 6, 21 8:16pm\r\nOn my website, ontovictorypress.com, I have a search field that should have a transparent background. Click on magnifying glass in header to see. However, on my phone (iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 15.1) the background on the <input type=“search”> is white and no matter how specific I make my CSS, I can’t seem to change that to transparent). \r\n\r\nOne of my friends told me it looked fine on her device, so I began to investigate. I took a survey of friends with various devices and iOS versions (results to follow) and concluded that there is a bug somehow in iOS that is preventing background-color from overrulling default background-color on search fields. Or something like that. I haven’t investigated yet beyond my own website. Here are the results from my survey. I think you will see the pattern.\r\n\r\niPhone 13 Pro Max (iOS 15.1)— Error\r\niPhone 13 Pro Max (iOS 15.2)—Error\r\niPhone 12 Pro Max (iOS 15.1) — Error\r\niPhone 12 Pro (iOS 14.8) — Perfect\r\niPhone 11 (iOS 14.7.1) — Perfect\r\niPhone XS (iOS 15.1) — Error\r\niPhone XR (iOS 15) — Perfect\r\niPhone XR (iOS 14.8) — Perfect\r\niPhone X (iOS 14.6) — Perfect\r\niPhone 8 (iOS 14.6) — Perfect\r\niPhone SE (iOS 15.1) — Error\r\niPhone SE (iOS 14.4.2) Perfect\r\n\r\nJudging from the survey, the field is displaying incorrectly only on devices running iOS 15.1 or later. \r\n\r\nFor simplicity’s sake, I will include two screenshots: 1) one of what the search field is supposed to render as (renders correctly on every iOS version prior to 15.1) and 2) the second will be what it looks like on 15.1 and 15.2, which is rendering incorrect (beta 1).\r\n\r\nUpdate, Nov 6, 21 8:33pm\r\nI’ve confirmed the background-color issue is not isolated to my website. See this codepen (https://codepen.io/bobbybosler/pen/dyzmKMj) and please test on various version of iOS to see the difference."
