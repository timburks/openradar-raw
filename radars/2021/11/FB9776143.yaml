    created: "2021-11-24T16:05:20.692173Z"
    description: "When writing documentation using triple forward slashes within the scope of a Swift protocol, if the documentation follows a function declaration, and if the user has Code Snippets which use the \"Code Expression\" scope availability, those code snippets will be suggested by autocomplete after each whitespace input on the documentation line(s).\r\n\r\nSpeculation: Because functions may be declared within protocols without their normally required scope (`{ }`), the autocomplete engine continues to run under the context of a \"Code Expression\" until the next declaration of a var within the protocol, or until the protocol's scope is closed.\r\n\r\nThe attached Playground minimally reproduces this behavior. Attempting to input whitespace (or use Esc to manually bring up autocomplete) on either of the documentation lines annotated therein as producing the unexpected behavior will show the autocomplete suggestion list for the code snippets.\r\n\r\nKnown workarounds: Using block syntax (`/** docs */`) for documentation, or removing the \"Code Expression\" scope from the snippet's availability, avoids the unexpected autocompletion behavior.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nPrerequisite: At least one Code Snippet defined which uses \"Code Expression\" as its scope availability.\r\n\r\n1. Declare a swift Protocol\r\n2. Declare a function within the protocol\r\n3. Begin a line of documentation using triple forward slashes after the function declaration (still within the protocol scope)\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expect nothing to be suggested by autocomplete while writing documentation in any context.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nAutocomplete will suggest any code snippets which use the \"Code Expression\" scope availability after each new whitespace input within the line(s) of documentation following the function."
