    description: "When using the iOS localization mechanism, an empty translation for a given key will result in the key itself being rendered in a SwiftUI Text() structure.\r\n\r\nGiven the following Localizable.strings:\r\n“test1” = “foo”;\r\n“test2” = “”;\r\n\r\nAnd the following SwiftUI code:\r\nVStack {\r\n    Text(“test1”)\r\n    Text(“test2”)\r\n    Text(“test3”)\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe expected output is:\r\nfoo\r\n\r\ntest3\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nfoo – correct translation for “test1”\r\n<empty> – correct translation for “test2”\r\ntest3 – no translation available so correct fallback for “test3”\r\n\r\nActual output:\r\nfoo\r\ntest2\r\ntest3\r\n\r\nIn this, the “test2” is unexpected, because a translation has been provided for that key.\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible on iOS 14.5 and 15.0 in the simulator, and in 15.1 on a real device. However, this appears to not have been an issue on a real device running 14.8.\r\n\r\nHappy to provide any more necessary information."
