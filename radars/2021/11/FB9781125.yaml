    description: "In macOS 12, an application cannot make itself active when another app is active and has secure keyboard entry turned on. This is easily verified in Terminal.app by doing `open /System/Applications/Calculator.app` after enabling Terminal > Secure Keyboard Entry.\r\n\r\nThis has been a source of confusion for users of my app (iTerm2) and probably Terminal.app as well. You can see them flailing around here: https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/issues/10004\r\n\r\nMy request is for a notification to be sent to the active app (provided it enabled secure keyboard entry) that another app has requested key focus but has been denied. This would make it possible to notify the user that they might need to turn off secure keyboard input."
