    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\n\r\nWhen running `xcodebuild clean`, instead of just cleaning the build outputs, Xcode also resolves the Swift Package Manager dependencies and tries to download them.\r\n\r\nHere is an example output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% xcodebuild clean                                                                 \r\n\r\nCommand line invocation:\r\n    /Applications/Xcode-13.1.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild clean\r\n\r\nUser defaults from command line:\r\n    IDEPackageSupportUseBuiltinSCM = YES\r\n\r\nResolve Package Graph\r\n\r\nResolved source packages:\r\n  Starscream: https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream @ 4.0.4\r\n  MyPrivateLibrary: https://gitlab.example.com/mygroup/my-private-library.git @ 1.0.1\r\n  libPhoneNumber: https://github.com/iziz/libPhoneNumber-iOS @ master\r\n  Sentry: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git @ 7.5.0\r\n  Carte: https://github.com/devxoul/Carte @ master\r\n\r\n\r\nnote: Using new build system\r\nnote: Build preparation complete\r\n\r\n** CLEAN SUCCEEDED **\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because the `MyPrivateLibrary` in the example above requires authentication to download. There is no reason that a `clean` task should prompt for that authentication.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Create a project\r\n2. Add a Package Dependency that points to a private Git repository\r\n3. Run `xcodebuild clean` from the command line\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI expect that `clean` should not be generating new files, only removing old ones.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n\r\nThe `clean` process is downloading and generating more files, and is prompting for input for authentication."
