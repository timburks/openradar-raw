    description: "Please fix the Finder so that updates to the com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment xattr tag are shown in the Finder the same way that com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags are.\r\n\r\nOn 2 Macs connect to same network share, e.g. an AFP share on Synology with Synology's Indexing Service turned on. Right click the Finder columns to show tags and comment on both Macs. One 1 Mac select get info on a file and set a tag and a comment. On the other Mac the new tag appears but the comment doesn't. Get info on the file doesn't show the comment either. Using xattr to inspect the file shows the comment exists but it isn't shown in the UI like the tag is. I believe the comment column should update the same way the tag does.\r\n\r\nmdutil /Volumes/video -s\r\n/System/Volumes/Data/Volumes/video:\r\n\tServer search enabled.\r\n\r\nI can supply a screen recording if it is needed.\r\n\r\nmacOS 11.6.1 (20G224)\r\n\r\nIf comments are simply being deprecated in favour of tags then please let me know and I'll stop using them."
