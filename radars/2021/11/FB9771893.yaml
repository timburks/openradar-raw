    description: "I have multiple scenes in a NavigationView accessed with NavigationLins.\r\n\r\nI have a struct with nested structs which correspond to the scenes.\r\n\r\nAt the root scene, I have a state struct, and the nested scenes have binding structs. When Iâ€™m three levels down in the navigation stack and I modify the data, the app unexpectedly jumps back to the previous scene. So if I have a TextField, then at each character press, the navigation stack jumps back, making the app unusable.\r\n\r\nDevice running the project: iPhone 11 Pro / iOS 15.1\r\nXcode Version 13.1 (13A1030d)\r\nSwift: swift-driver version: 1.26.9 Apple Swift version 5.5.1 (swiftlang-1300.0.31.4 clang-1300.0.29.6) Target: x86_64-apple-macosx12.0"
