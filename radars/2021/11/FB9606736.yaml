    description: "We are testing an interrupted purchase (steps described here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox/testing_an_interrupted_purchase) in sandbox by forcing a Terms & Conditions popup. Upon accepting the new terms, we expect the StoreKit payment queue to receive a “Purchased” transaction. We don’t receive any updated transactions in the queue. This results in a confusing experience for the user, wherein content is not unlocked after paying for it.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Launch sample app (https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/tree/main/Examples/MagicWeather), logged into brand new Sandbox account with interrupt purchases turned on\r\n2. Click to purchase subscription\r\n3. Observe that payment queue receives a transaction with state “Purchasing”\r\n4. Sign-in successfully, see checkmark for purchase completion(?)\r\n5. View conditions have changed popup, click OK\r\n6. Observe that payment queue receives transaction with state “Failed”\r\n7. Observe that we call finishTransaction()\r\n8. Click agree on Terms and Conditions popup\r\n9. See “You’re all set, purchase was successful” popup and click OK\r\n10. Wait a bit, observe that nothing comes into the payment queue\r\n11. Check manage subs in phone settings -> see that subscription is active (note that this also backgrounds the app)\r\n12. Re-foreground app\r\n13. Observe that payment queue receives updated transaction with state “Purchased”\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nAfter step 9, we expect to get a “Purchased” updated transaction in the queue, as described here in the documentation’s step 10: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox/testing_an_interrupted_purchase.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nWe didn’t receive an updated transaction in the queue until we backgrounded and foregrounded the app. We were also able to trigger the updated transaction in the queue by attempting to repurchase (and getting the “you’re already subscribed” popup)."
