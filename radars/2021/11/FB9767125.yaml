    description: "Have an executable script. e.g. `ls.sh`\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nls\r\n\r\nVerify that is is executable in bash.\r\n> ls.sh\r\n\r\nOpen it with TextEdcit\r\nInsert a newline\r\nSave\r\n\r\nTry to run it in Terminal again:\r\n> ls.sh\r\nzsh: operation not permitted: ./ls.sh\r\n\r\nNote that TextEdit has slammed a quarantine attribute on it\r\n> xattr -l ls.sh\r\ncom.apple.TextEncoding: utf-8;134217984\r\ncom.apple.lastuseddate#PS: ??a\r\ncom.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags: bplist00?\r\ncom.apple.quarantine: 0086;619612f1;TextEdit;\r\n\r\nAlthough TextEdit does have the \r\ncom.apple.security.files.user-selected.executable\r\n\r\nentitlement, allowing exectuables to be openend and edited.\r\n\r\nSide Note: \r\nIf you dont' use the NSDocument based safe write routines, but just open that file directly and replace its contents evertyhing is fine. Which is a shame, so this isn't a security feature to not alow editing of scripts, it is just a bug when using the NSDocument based writing routines adding quarantine on overwrite too.\r\n\r\nThis was a problem for SubEthaEdit as it was using NSDocument based methods, now it uses the less \"safe\" just overwrite in place methods to work around this. which is unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThis behavior appeared in Monterey 12.0.1 for us. Big Sur does not have this."
