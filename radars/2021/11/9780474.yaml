    description: "Typing in Xcode is so laggy as to be almost unusable. I'm using a week old 64GB, 16\", M1 Max MacBook Pro - this is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nType a few characters then the text editor \"hangs\" - quite often I see the beachball. I've tried turning off \"show live issues\" and \"suggest completions while typing\", but this doesn't help.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be OK on a new project, but the existing large one I'm working on it's truly awful.\r\n\r\nThis project was fine to edit in Xcode 12.5.1\r\nI've tried Xcode 13.2 beta 2, but there's no improvement.\r\n\r\nOther people are seem to be seeing the same problem https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/691427"
