    description: "Using interactiveDismissDisabled, it is now possible to disable interactive dismissal of a sheet or other modal views.\r\n\r\nHowever, it’s often desirable to make this dependent on a user interaction. A canonical example for this is Apple’s Reminders app: after changing a reminder in the edit dialog, the user will be shown a confirmation dialog when trying to dismiss the dialog. \r\n\r\nIn UIKit, we can use presentationControllerDidAttemptToDismiss to achieve this. It seems presentationControllerDidAttemptToDismiss is lacking this feature.\r\n\r\nI built a drop-in solution that adds this to SwiftUI: in this gist: https://gist.github.com/peterfriese/8fb3d76bdbe21b84495b79b3a86bf898\r\n\r\nThere is also an article discussing this in more detail on my blog at https://peterfriese.dev\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss this further."
