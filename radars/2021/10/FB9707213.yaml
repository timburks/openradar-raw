    description: "Steps to reproduce:\r\n- Visit https://jsfiddle.net/2kca5j0t/\r\n- Resize the window. Observe that the gradient shape in the lower right appears cut off when the viewport is wider than it is tall. When resized so the viewport is narrow, the shape appears correct (not truncated).\r\n- Uncomment the \"transform: scale(1);\" rule.\r\n- Click the Run button in the upper left.\r\n- Observe that the gradient shape now appears correct regardless of the window size.\r\n- Visit the same demo page in Chrome and Firefox. Observe that the problem does not occur."
