    description: This appears to be an issue with all versions of SwiftUI. If you place a NavigationView at the top of a hierarchy, and then in that hierarchy you place a TabView, ToolBars will not display in the views in the TabViews. The workaround is to place the NavigationViews in each uppermost view under the TabView and treat each as its own separate hierarchy. A demonstration program is attached.
