    description: "I have an iPad Mini 5th gen device not connected to a network running 15.0.1.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to disable automatic updates without a network connection.  Because the General > Software Update pane pops an error modal when it can't check for updates, it bounces the focus back to the previous General pane, which makes it impossible to go into the \"Automatic Updates\" sub-pane from \"Software Update\" and disable automatic updates.\r\n\r\nI think this can be fixed by simply not forcing back to the General pane and leaving the \"Software Update\" pane focused following the popup of the \"Unable to Check for Update\" error modal."
