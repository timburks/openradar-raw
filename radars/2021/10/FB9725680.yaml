    description: "When creating a new file using Xcode’s “New -> File…” dialogue, it would be wonderful to create both a Swift file and its accompanying tests file using a single .filetemplate entry. Currently, this seems to be impossible because we would have to add the Swift file to the application target, and the tests file to the tests target, which does not seem to be currently supported.\r\n\r\nAside from efficiency, there is another key reason why this change would be useful: it would consistently name both the code file and the tests file so that counterparts in the assistant editor would work correctly."
