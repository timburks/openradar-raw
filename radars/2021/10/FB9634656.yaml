    description: "In iOS 14.5 simulator, if an instance of StoreKit.Product is saved to a local property, linking fails with the error: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _$s8StoreKit7ProductVMa\r\n```\r\n\r\nI’m including a sample project that demonstrates this. \r\nTo reproduce, just open RevenueCat.xcodeproj, select the RevenueCat scheme, and run tests on a simulator on iOS 14.5 or lower. \r\nYou’ll experience a crash right away, in `BreakLinkingFor14_5.swift`. \r\n\r\nIf the file gets commented out, the crash disappears. The file only contains a single property, a StoreKit.Product.\r\n\r\nNote that the file does have the correct `@available` checks for iOS 15.0. \r\n\r\nThis makes it nearly impossible to even reference StoreKit 2’s features on an app with a deployment target lower than iOS 15, even when API availability checks are in place. \r\n\r\nThe sample project is also available at https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/tree/storekit_2_linking_issue_demo."
