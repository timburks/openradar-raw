    description: 'When attempting to use VoiceOver, a ColorPicker() reports nothing more than “button”, regardless of the label or the value. To fix this, one would expect to be able to implement an .accessibility(label:) that would allow VoiceOver to describe the ColorPicker() as per the accessibility label, but that only reports “button” as well. To have VoiceOver be able to describe a ColorPicker(), the ColorPicker() must have the modifier .accessibilityElement(children: .ignore) on it for .accessibility(label:) to work. A small demonstration program is attached.'
