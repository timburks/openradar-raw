    description: "In the iOS 15 simulator if you have \"Connect hardware keyboard\" turned on, any time you also have the software keyboard visible but you type with the hardware keyboard the software keyboard will dismiss itself.\r\n\r\nOften it's useful to see what the screen looks like with the keyboard visible while you're typing through various fields. Prior to iOS 15 it didn't dismiss the keyboard.\r\n\r\n1. Tap a text field on the Simulator (iOS 15)\r\n2. I/O > Connect Hardware Keyboard (turn on)\r\n3. Toggle Software Keyboard if it's not visible\r\n4. Type any text\r\n\r\n*What did you expect to happen?*\r\nSoftware keyboard remains on screen unless toggled\r\n\r\n*What actually happened?*\r\nSoftware keyboard always dismisses when typing with a hardware keyboard"
