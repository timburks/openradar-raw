    description: "MacOS 10.11 introduced NSCollectionViewTransitionLayout, and the NSCollectionViewDelegate method collectionView(_:transitionLayoutForOldLayout:newLayout:), but these are documented as follows:\r\n\r\n“In macOS 10.11, collection views do not provide built-in support for driving layout transitions.” and for the delegate method “In OS X 10.11, this method is never called by the collection view.”\r\n\r\nIt looks like these never actually got implemented, and current MacOS still seems to be missing the equivalent of UICollectionView’s startInteractiveTransition(to:completion:) method.\r\n\r\nPlease can we have the rest of the layout transition API on MacOS, so that we can easily perform gesture driven transitions."
