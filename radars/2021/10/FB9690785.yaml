    description: "Apple Cash uses the address from identity verification instead of the address provided in the payment sheet during payment authorization or the billing address listed in settings. This can cause payments to be declined after an address change.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nSelect two addresses in different states. We will refer to these as Address 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new bank account with Address 1\r\n2. Enroll in Apple Cash via Settings\r\n3. Perform identity verification with your current address (Address 1)\r\n4. Change your address with the bank (Address 2)\r\n5. Change your billing address in Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > Apple Cash (Address 2)\r\n6. Select Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > Apple Cash > Add Money. Ensure that Address 2 is listed in the payment sheet. Add >=$500, this will be declined by the bank\r\n7. Observe the payment authorization request to the bank, it will incorrectly show Address 1 when address 2 was clearly specified."
