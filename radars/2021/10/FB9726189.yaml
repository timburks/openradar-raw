    description: "The script relies on the formatted output of `otool -s __TEXT __info_plist the_binary`, which is different between x86 and ARM code.\r\n\r\nI also documented this issue (and a fix) on this StackOverflow question and answer: https://stackoverflow.com/q/69746635/3141234\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Build an app that uses SMJobBless to bless and install a privileged helper tool\r\n2. Build it on an ARM Mac, to produce a native ARM binary\r\n3. Run `SMJobBless.py check TheApp.app`\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nIt should check whether or not the code signing settings are correct for the app & helper\r\n\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n\r\nThis error was printed:\r\n\r\n/Users/Alex/MyApp.app/Contents/Library/LaunchServices/ca.momchilov.MyApp.helper: tool __TEXT / __info_plist section dump malformed (2)"
