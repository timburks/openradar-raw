    description: "Thrilled that iOS 15 added SwiftUI support for inline links through markdown and the AttributedString API, however there is no way to add or customize a link highlight state for the inline links. Take this code for example:\r\n\r\nstruct TextExample: View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n      let text = try! AttributedString(markdown: \"This is my inline [link](https://www.apple.com). How do I set the highlight state?\")\r\n      return Text(text)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf the user taps the link, there is no highlight state applied. Additionally, engineers should be able to customize the style of this highlight state to provide an animation, overlay, and text style changes."
