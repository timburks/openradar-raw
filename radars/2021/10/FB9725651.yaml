    description: "When using the multitasking behavior on an iPad where you split screen two apps, SwiftUI’s NavigationView with NavigationLink in it will no longer push when switching to it. If you restart the app, it will work. \r\n\r\n1. Setup a SwiftUI view that has a NavigationView with a List in it with NavigationLinks.\r\n2. Run the application on an iPad (physical or simulator) like the 6th gen iPad mini\r\n3. Test that the split style of the NavigationView works by selecting the links in the list and seeing that the detail showing changes\r\n4. Tap the multitasking icon up top to go into split view with another app like Safari.\r\n5. Try taping the navigation links and notice the app no longer pushes.\r\n6. Restart the app in split screen and notice that you can tap the links again\r\n7. Adjust the sizing of the test app to be 2/3 of the screen and other app like Safari to 1/3\r\n8. Go back to split screen and notice that the links break again.\r\n\r\nI would expect that I could use NavigationView’s with Lists with NavigationLinks to push to new controller regardless if I’m multitasking or not. This should mirror the behavior of UISplitViewController.\r\n\r\nI’ve attached a video of the behavior and a sample project."
