    description: "I currently have an app on the App Store, built with UIKit.\r\n\r\nApp was rewritten to SwiftUI during this summer.\r\nEverything is OK with fresh install.\r\n\r\nBut, when app is launched after an update, I can only saw a black screen.\r\n\r\nThe only way to solve this is set a blank UISceneDelegateClassName in Info.plist file.\r\nBut this solution create a warning when launching the app.\r\n\r\n1. Create a UIKit app\r\n2. Launch the app on simulator\r\n3. Replace UIKit lifecycle by SwiftUI lifecycle (and remove unnecessary entries of Info.plist)\r\n4. Launch the app\r\n\r\nExpected result: the app\r\nCurrent result: a black screen\r\n\r\nFor easier debugging (especially to migrate between apps), a complete source code with 3 branches is attached:\r\n- main: UIKit sample app\r\n- swiftui: SwiftUI sample app\r\n- swiftui-fix-scenedelegate: SwiftUI app with a fix for Scene Delegate (with warning at launch)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/florentmorin/SwiftUIUpdate"
