    description: "The device (ipad mini 5th gen) activates its cellular connection to connect to Apple for activation, even with no SIM card installed, after a restore.\r\n\r\nThis leaks the IMEI and device location to the carrier, even when the cellular connection is not intended to be used at all on this device.\r\n\r\nThe device should not automatically connect to cellular data networks without warning or consent after a restore.  There's a data and privacy notice for activation about sending device information to Apple - but it sends the IMEI (and presumably some eSIM stuff) and location to the carrier prior to that without any such warning or consent!\r\n\r\nthis is on 15.0.1 on an ipad mini 5"
