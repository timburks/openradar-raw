    description: "When building a project with Xcode 13 that uses UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and NSDiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot, the performance of the creation of the initial snapshot has worsened dramatically compared to when built with Xcode 12.5. The issues appears to be related to Hashable and having the UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource store the models as their ItemIdentifierType. As you add properties to your model, the performance continues to get worse and worse. If you only store an identifier for the model in the data source, it does not have the performance issues.\r\n\r\nI’ve created a sample project that shows this behavior where you store the model vs the identifier. You can then run the Time Profiler and see the difference in the amount of time it takes for the loadInitialItems() to complete. I’m attaching instruments profiles for Xcode 12.5 and Xcode 13.\r\n\r\nOpen the project in Xcode 12.5 and run profile.\r\nSelect the Time Profiler and hit record.\r\nTap on the models tab and then ids tab.\r\nLook at the time performance logged for the models tab and then ids\r\nYou shouldn’t see a major difference in the time for loadInitialItems() which is called from the viewDidLoad() of the controller.\r\n\r\nOpen the project in Xcode 13 and run profile.\r\nSelect the Time Profiler and hit record.\r\nTap on the models tab and then ids tab.\r\nLook at the time performance logged for the models tab and then ids.\r\nYou will see a major difference in the time for loadInitialItems() which is called from the viewDidLoad() of the controller for the models tab vs the IDs tab.\r\nAdd another property to the Item struct in models tab such as let moreText: String \r\nRun the Time Profiler again and notice the time for the models tab has gotten worse.\r\n\r\nThe time difference I am seeing are as follows:\r\n\r\nXcode 12:\r\nModel: 94.00 ms\r\nID: 96.00 ms  \r\n\r\nXcode 13:\r\nModel: 1.07 s\r\nID: 282.00 ms  \r\n\r\nXcode 13 adding one property to models:\r\nModel: 1.21 s"
