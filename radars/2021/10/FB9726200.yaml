    description: "I have a tiny demo project that builds just fine (I’ve attached it).\r\n\r\nIt has two Swift files that aren’t a member of any target. If either one is checked off to be added to the `DemoPrivilegedHelper` target, the build fails with a seemingly completely unrelated error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: module name \"ca.momchilov.Demo-Privileged-Helper-App.helper\" is not a valid identifier\r\nCommand CompileSwiftSources failed with a nonzero exit code\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Build it, and confirm that it builds just fine.\r\n3. Select either `PrivilegedHelperConstants.swift` or `PrivilegedHelperConstants.swift`, and check off their target membership checkbox to add them to the `DemoPrivilegedHelper`\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nFor the project to build like normal\r\n\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n\r\n`swiftc` errors out with this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: module name \"ca.momchilov.Demo-Privileged-Helper-App.helper\" is not a valid identifier\r\nCommand CompileSwiftSources failed with a nonzero exit code\r\n```"
