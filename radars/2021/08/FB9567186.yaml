    description: "In a target that mixes Swift and Objective-C code, defines custom intents in a .intentdefinition file, and imports the Swift interface header (SWIFT_OBJC_INTERFACE_HEADER_NAME) in one of the Objective-C files, I'm seeing a couple of build warnings on the interface header (see below).\r\n\r\nThis can generate hundreds or thousands of warnings in a bigger project if the header is imported in many places or if there are many custom intents. It also doesn't seem to be fixable on the app developer's end.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\nOpen and build the attached sample project, or follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Swift iOS app project\r\n2. Add a new SiriKit Intent Definition file\r\n3. Add a new intent to the .intentdefinition file\r\n4. Add an Objective-C class to the project\r\n5. Import the \"ProjectNameGoesHere-Swift.h\" header (as defined in SWIFT_OBJC_INTERFACE_HEADER_NAME) in the .m file\r\n6. Build\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nThere should be no build warnings in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n\r\nI'm seeing the following warnings (multiple times):\r\n\r\nwarning: block pointer is missing a nullability type specifier (_Nonnull, _Nullable, or _Null_unspecified) [-Wnullability-completeness]\r\n\r\nwarning: multiple declarations of method 'handleSomeIntent:completion:' found and ignored [-Wduplicate-method-match]"
