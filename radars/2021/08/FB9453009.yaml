    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nOn macOS, SwiftUI's APIs for adding toolbar items to a window have (at least) two bugs around view recreation that lead to memory leaks and increased CPU pressure over time.\r\n\r\nIssue #1: ToolbarItem always creates an additional, \"ghost\" copy of the view it contains\r\nIssue #2: ToolbarItem creates an additional ghost copy of the view it contains every single time state changes\r\n\r\n(I've also written about and detailed this issue here: https://github.com/matt-curtis/mac-swiftui-toolbar-memory-leak-demo)\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Run the attached sample project.\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nSwiftUI should not create unneeded views that waste memory and CPU.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nViews are re-created unnecessarily, CPU pressure increases, and memory leaks."
