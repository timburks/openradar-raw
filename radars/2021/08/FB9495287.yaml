    description: "## Description\r\nIf a Safari Web Extension is clicked from the overflow menu (the menu indicated with >> at the end of the toolbar), its browser_action popup will not open and the extension will not be notified.\r\n\r\nThis affects every extension with a popup that I have tried, including the Apple-provided Sea Creator sample extension, DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, Bitwarden, and my own extensions.\r\n\r\nClicking the extension from this menu provides no extension functionality to the user. Furthermore there seems to be no way to detect this situation from the extension code.\r\n\r\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\r\n1. Download the Sea Creator sample code from https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/developing_a_safari_web_extension\r\n2. Follow the steps on that page to build and enable the Sea Creator Web Extension in Safari.\r\n3. Horizontally resize the Safari window until it is narrow enough for the Sea Creator icon to be moved to the overflow menu (indicated with a >> icon).\r\n4. Open the overflow menu and select the Sea Creator option.\r\n5. Observe that no popup is displayed.\r\n\r\n## Expected Results\r\nThe popup should be displayed.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\nThe popup is not displayed. No feedback is provided to the user. No recourse is provided to the extension developer.\r\n\r\n## Version Info\r\nI am using Safari 14.1.2, although this was also reproduced on the latest Safari Technology Preview Release 129 on macOS Big Sur 11.5.2.\r\n\r\n## File Uploads\r\n- safari webextension popup bug 720p.mov: https://youtu.be/tQoOYWe0jfE"
