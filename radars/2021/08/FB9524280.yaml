    description: "Description of the problem:\r\n---------------------------\r\nAccessibility via VoiceOver does not work for SwiftUI views on tvOS 15 beta (beta 5 at the time of this writing). The accessibility label is not read and the user is completely lost.\r\n\r\nStep-by-step instructions:\r\n--------------------------\r\nI provide an extremely simple sample project attached to this feedback. This is a SwiftUI tvOS app with a minimal app delegate and content view containing two buttons. I attached accessibility labels to both buttons (also marked to be accessibility elements):\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Run the project on a tvOS 15 device.\r\n3. Enable VoiceOver.\r\n4. Navigate between the buttons with the Apple TV remote. Accessibility labels are never read.\r\n\r\nIf you build and run the same project on a tvOS 14 device labels are correctly read. \r\n\r\nRemark: If no accessibility label is attached to the buttons (easy to reproduce by removing the accessibility view modifiers in the same sample code) VoiceOver will read the button label on tvOS 14, but nothing on tvOS 15 beta.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n----------------\r\nVoiceOver reads accessibility labels attached to SwiftUI views correctly on tvOS 15.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n----------------\r\nVoiceOver does not read accessibility labels attached to SwiftUI views correctly on tvOS 15."
