    description: "Pre Conditions:\r\n* iOS 15 beta 5 or 6\r\n* App supports connection with the registered MFi accessory\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Launch the app and connect with the accessory\r\n2. Move the app to the background\r\n3. About 30 sec after from step.2, communication between the accessory is lost.\r\n\r\nAt step.3, the app can not communicate via EASession because the app is suspended in the background state. But the app defines `external-accessory` in the Background Modes, so we believe background behavior should be guaranteed by iOS. So we think this is the issue of iOS 15 beta. Of course the app works as expected on iOS 14.x."
