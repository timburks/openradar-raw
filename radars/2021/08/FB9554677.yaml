    description: "In Mac Catalyst apps, mouse clicks are ignored while scrolling (with a scroll wheel). For trackpad scrolling, clicks are registered correctly. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Preparation:\r\n  1.1) Open a Mac Catalyst app, for example Podcasts\r\n  1.2) In the sidebar, select Top Charts\r\n  1.3) Scroll down the list to preload around 200 podcasts.\r\n2) Reproduction:\r\n  2.1) Using a trackpad, get the list scrolling (with two-finger flick gesture)\r\n  2.2) Press the trackpad. Observe: inertial scrolling stops and the app registers the click (opens whatever podcast is under the cursor)\r\n  2.3) Now, get the list scrolling using a scroll wheel (such as free-spin mode on Logitech mouse)\r\n  2.4) While scrolling, press the left button of the mouse.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe scrolling stops, the click is registered (like with the trackpad)\r\n\r\nObserved result:\r\nScrolling continues, the click is ignored.\r\n\r\nAdditional info: \r\nIn non-Catalyst apps (such as Mail), the issue does not reproduce: both mouse and trackpad stop scrolling and register the click."
