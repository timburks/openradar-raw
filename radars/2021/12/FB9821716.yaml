    description: "Secure UITextField (with isSecureTextEntry set to true) shows text replacement suggestions. And even expands them after Space key is pressed. \r\n\r\nExplicitly disabling autocorrectionType, smartQuotesType, smartDashesType in the storyboard has no effect (see text input trait parameters attached).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Create an iOS app with a UITextField, set isSecureTextEntry to true.\r\n- Build and run it for Mac Catalyst target\r\n- Type “omw” to the text field\r\n\r\nObserved behavior: “On my way!” suggestion shown below the field. (See attached screenshot)\r\nExpected behavior: no additional hints/input suggestions shown."
