    description: "Syntax highlighting doesn't work for symbols from pre-compiled Swift static libraries (with or without .xcframework). The issue is 100% reproducible. It's a regression from Xcode 13 because everything works as expected in Xcode 12.5.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload the sample project from https://github.com/andre-alves/xcode13-indexing-problem and follow the README."
