    description: "The iOS Simulator's Settings app on iOS 15.2 does not surface app-specific settings even after prompting for location permission. This particular bug is evidenced by the fact that the app-specific settings DO appear in the Settings app after the app prompts for any other non-location permission (e.g. Photos Library access). Furthermore, the Location Services menu is missing from the iOS Simulator's Privacy section and was previously present on other versions of the iOS SDK (I have filed a separate feedback for that issue, although I suspect they are related).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n~~ Build and run the attached sample app on the iOS Simulator with Xcode 13.2 and iOS 15.2. Then, in the sample app do the following: ~~\r\n\r\n1. Tap to request location permission\r\n2. Grant when in-use or always\r\n3. Check the Settings app\r\n4. The app does not appear in the Settings app\r\n5. Location permissions are not visible in Settings > Privacy\r\n6. Open the sample app again\r\n7. Tap to request photos permission\r\n8. Grant access to photos\r\n9. Check the Settings app\r\n10. The app does appear in the Settings app\r\n11. Location permissions are still not visible in Privacy\r\n\r\nThis can be replicated with any app targeting any SDK. The sample app is as simple as possible, however.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nThe iOS Simulator's Settings app should surface app-specific settings after prompting for location permission. The iOS Simulator's Settings app should show Location Services in the Privacy section.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe iOS Simulator's Settings app does not surface app-specific settings after prompting for location permission. Additional permissions must be requested before app-specific settings appear in the simulator. The iOS Simulator's Settings app never shows any Location Services in the Privacy section, regardless of location state, simulated location, or permissions requests."
