    description: "Link to SO: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53180469/why-is-appwillresignactive-called-when-first-opening-app\r\n\r\nWhen I load up the application the app delegate is calling applicationWillResignActive during the initial app load process. To my knowledge applicationWillResignActive is called when theres a phone call or text message received or when the anything interrupts the application. Heres the comment in the app delegate for appWillResignActive\r\n\r\nSent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state. This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions (such as an incoming phone call or SMS message) or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the background state. Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and invalidate graphics rendering callbacks. Games should use this method to pause the game.\r\n\r\nAnd I know this is being called when the app first opens because I logged it using NSLog and stopped it using breakpoints. This is the flow returned from me logging the function calls\r\n\r\nApplication Became Active\r\nApplication Will Resign Active\r\nApplication Became Active\r\nHeres the code as written in the app delegate\r\n\r\nfunc applicationWillResignActive(_ application: UIApplication) {\r\n\r\n    NSLog(\"Application Will Resign Active\")\r\n\r\n}\r\nfunc applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {\r\n\r\n    NSLog(\"Application BEcame Active\")\r\n\r\n}\r\nI think this could be a bug since why would the app resign active when your trying to first load up the application? Or is the the correct flow for loading up the app? If so the comment makes it very confusing"
