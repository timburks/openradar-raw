    description: "# Issue\r\nFrom tests we’ve done it appears the for iOS 14.8.1 and higher, system is not re-launching our app on region boundary changes after the device has lost power and is turned back on. As long as the device has not lost power, region monitoring seems to function correctly, and even relaunches the app on boundary changes.\r\n\r\nWe also tested this behavior on iOS 13, where even after a device reboot, region monitoring resumes, and re-launches the app in the background to handle region boundary changes.\r\n\r\n# Reproduction scenario\r\nAssumed for the following scenario’s is we have an app which has region monitoring setup, and some functionality is in place to track wether region exits/enters triggered (Console.app check for delegate calls `locationManager:didDetermineState:forRegion`).\r\n\t1.\tEnsure background refresh is enabled\r\n\t2.\tLaunch the app\r\n\t3.\tSetup region monitoring\r\n\t4.\tReboot the device\r\n\t5.\tDo relaunch or open the app\r\n\t6.\tExit your defined region\r\n\t7.\tEnter your defined region\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nRegion exit and enter are tracked.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n- Region exit and enter are not tracked after iOS 14.8.1.\r\n- Region exit and enter are tracked pre iOS 14.8.1."
