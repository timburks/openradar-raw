    description: "The universal/short link to our appâ€™s Mac App Store page (https://appstore.com/mac/zeteticllc/codebook) causes the App Store app on a Mac to go into an infinite loop when trying to load up the App Store page; a video demonstrating the problem is attached. Eventually an error alert appears saying unable to connect to the store, and then the application beachballs and has to be force quit. This has been reported to us by our customers and we can easily reproduce it. This is on macOS 11.6 Big Sur, affects Monterey as well.\r\n\r\nThis report was filed two months ago, and we've posted on the developer forums about it as well--no response at all, very disappointing. The short link is the only way we know of to provide a download link for our app in the Mac App Store that our international customers could reliably use."
