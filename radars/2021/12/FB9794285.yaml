    description: "Custom use of XCTOSSignpostMetric is broken for use with XCTest. This would be extremely useful for us as we are trying to automate specific timing-related performance tests that we donâ€™t have a good mechanism for measuring outside of signposts.\r\n\r\nThe XCTOSSignpostMetric.init(subsystem: category: name:) initializer does nothing.\r\n\r\nI reduced the issue to the smallest example possible: https://github.com/tspike/SignpostTest\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\nClone https://github.com/tspike/SignpostTest\r\nRun signpost UI tests\r\nObserve that no performance data is captured"
