    description: "Using a StateObject in a view to show different views depending upon certain app state. This has worked in the past, and works currently on iOS. However, when trying to run on watchOS is causes the following runtime error:\r\n\r\nruntime: SwiftUI: Accessing State's value outside of being installed on a View. This will result in a constant Binding of the initial value and will not update.\r\n\r\nAn ObservedObject causes the constant Binding occurs. With a StateObject, the UI works, but the error remains."
