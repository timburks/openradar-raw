    description: "This only happens on our non-app store build. Our server has the app site association:\r\nhttps://cloud.spartascience.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association\r\n\r\nWe add the web credentials for our app store distribution which eliminates this issue. However, the gray box shouldn't appear if we don't have the web credentials entitlement\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n    \"Passwords...\" AutoFill modal should pop up when focusing/activating the user log-in field if we have entitlements\r\n\r\nObserved behavior:\r\n    Initially when clicking on the username or password fields, this gray box appears instead of the password modal.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\n1. Launch Sparta Scan\r\n2. Click on the email field\r\n3. Type anything and the gray box should pop up"
