    description: "GCVirtualController does not display all buttons on screen when the device is in portrait orientation. My game allows users to play in both portrait and landscape orientations, but this bug means my users cannot use the virtual controller when in portrait mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Initialize GCVirtualController with configuration\r\n2) Call GCVirtualController.connect()\r\n3) Rotate device to portrait orientation (if not already)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGCVirtualController displays all buttons specified in GCVirtualController.Configuration.elements in both portrait and landscape orientations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the right-half controls are visible in portrait orientation.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve attached a sample project that can be used to demonstrate the issue, as well as some screenshots of the issue from my iPhone 11."
