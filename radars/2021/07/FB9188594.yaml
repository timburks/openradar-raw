    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nWe want to be able to assert that all of our objects were deallocated as expected after running our ui tests. However, we see that there are accessibility nodes that reference our view models and prevent that from happening only when running ui tests. When doing it manually through our ui we do not see the accessibility nodes retaining our view models, which is why we think it might be a bug on Apple's side.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Run any UI test\r\n2. Set breakpoint at the end of the test\r\n3. Look at memory and object graph and see view models being retained\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nObjects should be released and we should be able to assert that they were deallocated.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nView models are retained and we are unable to assert that they were deallocated."
