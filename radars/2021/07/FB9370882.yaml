    description: "As of iOS 15 beta 3, deallocating a GCVirtualController instance causes the app to stop responding to interface rotations. This is a problem because my app requires different GCVirtualController.Configurations for different games, but there’s no way to change a GCVirtualController’s configuration without deallocating + creating a new GCVirtualController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Initialize GCVirtualController with configuration\r\n2) Call GCVirtualController.connect()\r\n3) Call GCVirtualController.disconnect()\r\n4) Deallocate GCVirtualController by removing all strong references\r\n5) Attempt to rotate interface orientation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app continues to rotate as expected in response to interface orientation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app no longer rotates in response to interface orientation.\r\n\r\nI’ve attached a sample project to demonstrate this issue. Compile + run the project, then show + dismiss the virtual controller to see interface autorotation stop working. To “fix” this, change the “shouldDeallocateVirtualController” variable on line 12 of ContentView to “false”, which re-uses the virtual controller rather than deallocating it each time."
