    description: "The order of VNRecognizeTextRequest results is completely broken on iOS 15. The results candidates' bounding boxes are correct, but the order of the results, which we all rely on to be in a natural order of appearance, is wrong. Attached is a minimal project that reproduces the bug. It contains a test image with text which is then used as an input for the VNRecognizeTextRequest. The app displays the request’s results in a list, so you can easily see the results order inconsistency when running on iOS 14 vs iOS 15 simulator (or device).\r\n\r\nI really hope this gets fixed in the next iOS beta as this is a critical regression bug that I’m sure is affecting a lot of developers. Thank you, and please let me know if I can provide anything else."
