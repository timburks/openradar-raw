    description: "In a base OS installation, with no changes made, following a fresh install on an erased disk:\r\n\r\nSome keyboard shortcuts are enabled with no corresponding keystroke assigned. The keyboard shortcuts appear in System Preferences:Keyboard:Shortcuts.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nWith a fresh OS installation, look in System Preferences:Keyboard:Shortcuts. Examine the various categories, looking for which keyboard shortcuts are enabled and what keystrokes are assigned.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n\r\nAny shortcut without a keystroke assigned (those that show “none” for the keystroke) is not enabled.\r\n\r\nObserved behavior:\r\n\r\nSome keystrokes are enabled (its checkbox is checked) without having a keystroke assigned (“none” is shown). See the attached keyboard_shortcuts.png (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/attachment?aid=510004&signed_aid=ntnYJkpN7DF4bt42P96DbQ==).\r\n\r\nIn a fresh installation of macOS 12.0db2 21A5268h on a MacBookPro17,1, these keyboard shortcuts are enabled with no corresponding keystroke assigned.\r\n\r\nMission Control:Turn Do Not Disturb On/Off\r\nServices:Pictures:Set Desktop Picture\r\nServices:Messaging:New Email To Address\r\nServices:Messaging:New Email With Selection\r\nServices:Files and Folders:New Terminal at Folder\r\nServices:Files and Folders:New Terminal Tab at Folder\r\nServices:Files and Folders:Encode Selected Audio Files\r\nServices:Files and Folders:Encode Selected Video Files\r\nServices:Searching:Look Up in Dictionary\r\nServices:Text:Add to Music as a Spoken Track\r\nServices:Text:Convert Text to Full Width\r\nServices:Text:Convert Text to Half Width\r\nServices:Text:Open\r\nServices:Text:Show in Finder\r\nServices:Text:Show Info in Finder\r\nServices:Text:Show Map\r\nServices:Internet:Add to Reading List\r\n\r\nBeing enabled without a corresponding keystroke assigned is meaningless, and the Keyboard preference pane goes out of its way to prevent a user from creating this situation by requiring a keystroke when enabling a shortcut that does not yet have one assigned. However, this misconfiguration exists the default set of keyboard shortcuts as shipped by Apple in the base OS. It is unclear whether other bugs may exist due to a keyboard shortcut being enabled without having a corresponding keystroke assigned.\r\n\r\nI have seen this on fresh installations of both macOS 12.0db2 21A5268h and macOS 11.4 20F71."
