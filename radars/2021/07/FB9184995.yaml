    description: "We have a couple separate targets in Xcode for our XPC services that we want to gather code coverage for. In the attached screenshot `gather-coverage-for-XPC.png` you can see that we have told Xcode to gather the code coverage for both XPC targets. When we run our tests, we see coverage for the other targets but do not see any coverage in XPC targets.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Create a project with XPC and enable test coverage\r\n2. Run test that calls XPC and you can even set a breakpoint\r\n3. See regular classes are covered but classes that are in XPC target shown no coverage\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nXcode shows coverage for code in XPC target \r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nXPC target shows no coverage for code"
