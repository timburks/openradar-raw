    description: "Some sites has subdomains with different account. For example: paypal.com and sandbox.paypal.com. So, we need two users and two password to it. If i will use same email: user@icloud.me for both domain Safari will damage previous one:\r\n\r\n1. Register in sandbox.paypal.com with user@icloud.me, generate password by Safari and save it\r\n2. Then try to login into Sandbox using saved login and password from Safari Vault, should work\r\n3. Go to paypal.com and register usual account for the same email user@icloud.me, generate password by Safari and save it\r\n4. Then try to login into general paypal.com with saved login and password from Safari Vault, should work\r\n5. Try to return into sandbox.paypal.com, press logout if you logged in.\r\n6. Try to login using saved login and password suggested by Safari, should FAIL, it start using password from general paypal.com, instead of sandbox.paypal.com\r\n7. Try to check Safari/Settings/Passwords, search for paypal. You will found only one entry for both paypal.com and sandbox.paypal.com with the same password, last one generated. Previous one is lost. There are also no history for password change, so you unable to find that information and need to recover password.\r\n8. Then you recovering password from sandbox.paypal.com, Safari will overwrite previous paypal.com password by new one."
