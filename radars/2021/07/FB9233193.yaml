    description: "Apple Music gets resume feature\r\n- like most native + 3rd party apps since macOS 10.7 Lion\r\n- regardless whether due to app (re)start or due to system restart with [√] \"Reopen windows when logging back in\"\r\n\r\nWhen Apple Music restarts it restores the state of…\r\n1) Current song + its playback position\r\n2) Shuffle mode + Repeat mode\r\n3) Selection in Sidebar\r\nor\r\n4a) Search input in Sidebar\r\n4b) Controls in content area, i.e. Column browser and selection state (single or multi) per column: Genres, Artists, Albums\r\n4c) Filter input\r\n\r\n5) Scroll position in playlist / result-list\r\nYou do that just fine in Safari tabs, so should work in Apple Music too\r\n\r\nUser motivation:\r\n- When opening Apple Music, I'd like to continue just where I left off.\r\n- Starting afresh or somewhere else is easy, just change selection, filter, search.\r\n- But restoring the previous state is more effort.\r\n- So usability-wise it's wise to do how everywhere else on macOS!\r\n\r\nWould be great!"
