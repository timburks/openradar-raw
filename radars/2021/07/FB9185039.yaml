    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nApp Store Connect shows multiple crashes (see: app-store-connect-crashes.png) for v1.9.0 of our app while Xcode organizer shows only a single crash (see: organizer-crashes.png) on one device. Xcode organizer has much more detailed information.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Go to app store connect and view crashes under metrics for a version of the app\r\n2. Go to Xcode Organizer and view crashes for the same version of that app\r\n3. See that they disagree\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nXcode organizer and app store connect should show the same number of crashes. Also, it would be nice if we could download crashes directly from app store connect so that people on our team that aren't necessarily developers can also access them without having to retrieve them from customer machines.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nApp store connect shows more crashes but doesn't provide stack trace. Xcode shows a single crash"
