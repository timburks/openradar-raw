    classification: Security - App Sandbox Escape
    created: "2021-07-08T23:14:14.935065Z"
    description: "From app sandbox, we are unable to launch .swift scripts. In particular, main.swift with a header of \"#!/usr/bin/swift\". We get the error: `xcrun: error: cannot be used within an App Sandbox` At the same time, we are able to run other scripts with identical functionality such as .zsh scripts with a header of \"#!/bin/zsh\"\r\n\r\nWe would prefer to write our scripts in swift rather than zsh. Why are there specific restrictions on swift scripts? Note that all of the scripts are code-signed and included in the app bundle.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app with app sandbox enabled\r\n2. Create a .swift script that is included in resources\r\n3. Use Process (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process/2890108-run) to launch the script\r\n4. See that the console has error message and script does not start"
