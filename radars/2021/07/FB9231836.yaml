    description: "Our app uses subclasses of NSTextField and the related NSTextFieldCell and NSSecureTextFieldCell. We do this simply to have a customized appearance and do not change any of the underlaying mechanics of the classes.\r\n\r\nStarting with beta 2 of macOS 12: Manta Ray our NSSecureTextFieldCell is causing a crash when it is unexpectedly receiving a _shouldSuppressIndicators message from AppKit when the insertion point is set. This crashes the entire app that our text field is in. In production this means that the SecurityAgent crashes and the user can no longer log into the Mac. In testing our UI runner also will see this problem and the test rig will crash.\r\n\r\n_shouldSuppressIndicators is a private AppKit message being sent to our text field. We have no control over it.\r\n\r\nRegression testing:\r\nThis issue does not occur on releases of macOS earlier than beta 2.\r\nThe issue does not occur with the stock NSSecureTextField."
