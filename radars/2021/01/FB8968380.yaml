    description: Our HIDDriverKit extension crashes due to missing symbols when built with the latest Xcode 12. When the extension is built with Xcode 11.7, no crash occurs. The crash happens on macOS 10.15.7 on an Intel core i7 MacBook Pro. Iâ€™ve also tried building with Xcode 12.2 but it crashes as well due to missing symbols.
