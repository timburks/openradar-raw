    description: "When my app is in full screen on Big Sur and the theme is light mode, a white line appears occasionally at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nI have a titlebar accessory view controller. This has been flaky during Big Sur, so my guess is that itâ€™s involved.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Install iTerm2 3.4.0beta13 from https://iterm2.com/downloads, or clone https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2 and checkout commit 08faffe83b2209ad5b8f5196b7b116a485317d65 then build & run in Xcode.\r\n2. Enter full screen mode\r\n3. Type for a while. A white line periodically appears at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nYou can see a screen recording here:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/uploads/162bbc892099299d0f55eccce611446a/Screen_Recording_2020-10-19_at_9.58.57_AM.mov\r\n\r\nI am able to reproduce this easily on my own machine. I captured the view hierarchy (attached) and it does not appear there.\r\n\r\nI have tried removing the title bar accessory view controller, but that does not solve the problem.\r\n\r\n[sample project at https://iterm2.com/misc/whitebar.zip]"
