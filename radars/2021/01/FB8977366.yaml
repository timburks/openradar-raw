    description: "Related to UICollectionView with Compositional Layout.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a NSCollectionLayoutBoundarySupplementaryItem with extendsBoundary=false, the boundary of the section is extended unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nI’ve included a reproduction. When showing the supplementary item with extendsBoundary=false, I’d expect the item to be added without changing the size of the section. However as can be seen in the reproduction, the following section is pushed down with some whitespace when this supplementary item is added."
