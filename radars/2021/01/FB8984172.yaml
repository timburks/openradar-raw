    description: "When creating a new multi-platform App template, with Core Data enabled. If launched on iOS, e.g. iPhone Simulator the toolbar does not appear. Launching it on macOS does not have the problem.\r\n\r\nSome forum links:\r\nhttps://www.hackingwithswift.com/forums/swiftui/toolbar-not-working-from-app-template/5481\r\n\"@ShadowDES  \r\nDec 25\r\nYes, putting it in a navigation view and changing the .toolbar to your code works. I don't understand why Apple would put out a template that doesn't work at all (I've seen it before, just baffles me).\"\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/661950\r\n\"The template in Xcode 12.2 beta produces a blank white screen on iOS\"\r\nPosted 4 months ago by davidcc  \r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Launch Xcode.\r\n2. File->New Project->Multiplatform->App->Next->Name: Test App->Check \"Use Core Data\"->Next->Create\r\n3. In the windows, title bar, select Test App (iOS)->iOS Simulators->iPhone 12 mini\r\n4. Click the build and run play button.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nA toolbar with a plus button should appear on the screen.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe screen is blank."
