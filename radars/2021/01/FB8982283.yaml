    description: "We have a suite of custom in-house modal presentations styles that use the UIKit UIPresentationController APIs. We've noticed a VoiceOver bug with our modal presentations: if you activate a text field and then trigger one of our custom modal presentations, the text field underneath the modal steals VoiceOver focus when the modal presentation has completed. This issue only occurs with our custom modal presentationsâ€”the same issue does not reproduce with the system presentation style.\r\n\r\nIn the attached example project, you can trigger this behavior by focusing the text field, moving the focus to the \"show custom modal\" button, and then triggering the button. This will result in the focus first moving to the custom modal, and then errantly moving back to the previously focused text field. It is expected that focus stays on the presented modal view controller. You can find attached a video of this behavior as well.\r\n\r\nIf you perform the same steps but trigger the \"show system modal\" instead, you will notice that the aforementioned behavior does not occur.\r\n\r\nWe have only noticed this behavior when the presenting view controller has UICollectionView content. It doesn't appear to reproduce when the presenting view controller has a UIStackView content.\r\n\r\nTested on Xcode 12.3/iOS 14.3."
