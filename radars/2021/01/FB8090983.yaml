    description: "# Description\r\n\r\nIf you double-tap (iOS) or double-click (macOS) a populated SecureField, part of the content becomes highlighted on letter/digit boundaries - revealing information about the value stored in the SecureField.\r\n\r\nXcode 12.0 beta 2 (12A6163b)\r\nmacOS 11.0 Beta (20A4300b)\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct SecureFieldRadar: View {\r\n\t@State private var secret = \"12AB?abcd@3ef\"\r\n\t\r\n\tvar body: some View {\r\n\t\tSecureField(\"secret\", text: self.$secret)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct SecureFieldRadar_Previews: PreviewProvider {\r\n\tstatic var previews: some View {\r\n\t\tSecureFieldRadar()\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* run the sample code\r\n* the SecureField displays its value as a sequence of bullets\r\n* double-click (or double-tap) somewhere in the middle of the bullets\r\n\r\n# Expected outcome\r\n\r\nThe whole contents (all the bullets) would be selected. Or none of them.\r\n\r\n# Actual outcome\r\n\r\nBullets are selected based on the value stored in the text field.\r\n\r\nIn the example code, the SecureField has the value \"12AB?abcd@3ef”. If you double-click in the middle, then the bullets representing “abcd” are selected.\r\n\r\nYou can click in other areas to highlight “12”, “AB”, “3” and “ef”.\r\n\r\nI wouldn’t expect the SecureField to leak information about its value to an observer."
