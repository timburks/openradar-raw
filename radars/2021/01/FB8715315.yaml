    description: "In iOS 14, notification extension are frequently not loaded. Some tweets along with video here:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/thecosas/status/1304812909759873024\r\n\r\nThis seem to happen sporadically, but at least once a day in iOS 14. This is happening to my app, Due, (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/due/id390017969) which uses rich notifications.\r\n\r\nUsers are reporting the issue with other system apps as well. Most of the time a reboot is needed to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, if the notification extension was not loaded and resulted in a blank screen, tapping outside the notification to dismiss the expanded view, and 3D Touch-ing the same notification again can load the extension properly (though most of the time it doesn't happen and requires a reboot).\r\n\r\nThere are crash logs related to my app found, and there are no Jetsam logs during the time of the problem either."
