    description: "% mkdir foo && touch foo/file\r\n% (rm -rf bar && mkdir bar && cd foo && pax -rw -p m . ../bar)\r\n% stat -f %Fm foo/file bar/file\r\n1609694909.786078198\r\n1609694972.000000000\r\n\r\nbar/file should have an mtime that has subsecond resolution, like foo/file has.\r\n\r\nThis is important for mtime-based build systems. With the current behavior, builds that use pax to copy directories only work correctly if each build step takes at least a second. (Which is often the case --- but not always. When using `git bisect run` on a tiny project, this bug can cause problems.)\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/nico/hack/blob/master/notes/copydir.md for some general background."
