    description: "Please add the ability for PHPhotoLibrary to do a presentLimitedLibraryPicker with a specific set of photo asset IDs pre-selected, so that apps that have lost their photo permissions due to a reinstall or other issue can efficiently regain access to photos they were using previously without users having to manually go through and select them all again.\r\n\r\nOur app lets users bookmark + view a list of recently selected photos from their photo library. It doesn't really need to be able to access the entire library - users are only picking one photo at a time anyway and can do so perfectly well with the lovely new PHPickerViewController - but in order to make that function durable through reinstalls / syncs / etc, we either need to request access to the entire photo library, which is an unnecessary intrusion into users' privacy, or save a copy of every photo, which wastes a ton of storage space."
