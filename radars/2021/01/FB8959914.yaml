    description: "What is my desired use case of NSPersistentCloudKitContainer ?\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to persist / share data similar to the Notes apps between different iCloud users.\r\n\r\nData shared between specific users shouldnâ€™t be stored as public data, it should have some extra level of security, not available in the private context.\r\n\r\nIn my use case, I'd like to share budget data between users who may not be using the same icloud account or family options. This could be boy / girl friend or even business partners.\r\n\r\nThe NSPersistentCloudKitContainer provides excellent features in the public / private context but not in share / sync. Providing this functionality on top of NSPersistentCloudKitContainer mean circumventing a lot of the feature the api provides, which is counter productive."
