    description: "On an app targeting Mac OS 10.4 and later, I can use the `-requestEnableTethering`, `-requestTakePicture` and similar APIs on `ICCameraDevice` to take photos using connected cameras.\r\n\r\nOn iPadOS, if I want to control connected cameras in a similar fashion, I have to send the raw PTP commands to them, and I have to know which manufacturer uses which PTP command.\r\n\r\nIt would be really great to bring the tethered capture APIs in ImageCaptureCore from the Mac to iPadOS.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
