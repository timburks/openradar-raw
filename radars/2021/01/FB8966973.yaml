    description: "1. Turn on Home Sharing in iTunes 12.9.5.5 via File > Home Sharing > Turn On...\r\n\r\n2. Turn on Home Sharing on another computer. Both are using the same Apple ID in iTunes and Home Sharing.\r\nI also have \"share entire library\" selected in iTunes > Preferences > Sharing > Share my library on my local network.\r\n\r\n3. From one computer, select the other computer's library from the source drop-down list in the upper left corner of the iTunes window.\r\n\r\nThe albums in the other computer's library will appear. But if you select any album, no tracks will appear, and it will say \"No items\".\r\n\r\n4. If one computer has tracks that aren't in the other computer, selecting Show: Items not in my library will show the album, but if you try to import, it will give non-specific error:\r\n\r\n       There was a problem downloading \"<track name>\". An unknown error occurred (-50).\r\n\r\nFor me I believe this problem started with Mojave, but that may have been because that's when I stopped using the last fully functional version of iTunes (12.6.5.3).\r\n\r\nThe expected result is that iTunes Home Sharing should work in Mojave."
