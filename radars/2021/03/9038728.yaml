    description: "When updating the content of a ScrollView, if the new content requires the indicators to be visible (i.e. expanding the content size) the content will be improperly rendered with the full ScrollView width disregarding the ScrollView's indicators which will cover some of the content.\r\n\r\nA workaround is manually forcing the ScrollView to be re-updated either by changing a state or an observed object.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project\r\n2. The view takes 1 second to update and render a list inside the ScrollView\r\n3. Notice the border that wraps each element. The trailing size is hidden behind the ScrollView indicators\r\n4. Manually resizing the window trigger an update that fixes the content size.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe content should be rendered with a padding that takes into account the width of the indicators.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nCurrently, the content is rendered with the full ScrollView size and partially hidden by the indicator. Any updates that trigger re-rendering the ScrollView content will resize the content fixing the issue."
