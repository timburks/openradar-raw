    description: "When using an iPad Pro with a smart keyboard, GCKeyboard connected/disconnected notifications and the GCKeyboard.coalesced properties do not behave as expected.\r\n- When the smart keyboard is fully connected, GCKeyboard indicates that a keyboard is connected (correct)\r\n- When the smart keyboard is fully disconnected, GCKeyboard indicates that no keyboard is connected (correct)\r\n- When the smart keyboard is connected on the back of the iPad but not at the bottom (magnetic), GCKeyboard indicates that a keyboard is connected, even though the virtual keyboard is no longer displayed when a text field is first responder (incorrect).\r\n\r\nThis could be an issue when a user accidentally disconnects the keyboard while playing a game for example. The game would not pause.\r\nI've attached\r\n- a test app\r\n- a video exhibiting the problem with the test app\r\n- a sysdiagnose taken immediately after the video"
