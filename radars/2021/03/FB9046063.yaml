I imagine this bug is also present in Big Sur 11.3 Beta, but it will be a bit harder to test. I will try and get Big Sur 11.3 Beta 3 and an older version of the Pro Video Codecs, but it will be impossible to test this on Big Sur 11.3 Beta 4 as there will not be any updates available that require a reboot and applications being force closed."
