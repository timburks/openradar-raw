    description: "Xcode create invalid mapping models for Core Data models that have a date derived attribute which derivation expression is `now()`.\r\nFor those entities `sourceEntityVersionHash` and `destinationEntityVersionHash` for the mapping doesn’t match the version hash in the source and destination models.\r\n\r\nFor automatic migrations the mapping model isn’t used because the hashes don’t match.\r\nSo I created a sample project with a manual migration which the mapping model is loaded from a specific file or inferred.\r\n\r\nWhen migrating from the mapping model `Persistence.migrationModel = .migrationModel` the migration fails with error: \"Mismatch between mapping and source/destination models\"\r\n\r\nWhen migrating with inferred model `Persistence.migrationModel = .infered` the migration don’t fail but it isn’t possible to customize it.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround I create the option `Persistence.migrationModel = .fixedMigrationModel`, which will check if the version hashes don’t match and force them to be equal if the entity have a derived attribute of `Date` type and with derivation expression is `now()`.\r\n\r\nThe sample project can be found at https://github.com/diogot/CoreDataModelMigrationBug"
