    description: "Scenario :\r\n- You are on iOS 12\r\n- Have an old version of an app installed on your phone, the app only supports iOS 13+ but it used to support iOS 12.\r\n- App is offloaded by iOS\r\n- When you attempt to un-offload the app, the app fails to install\r\n\r\nLooking at the associated sysdiagnose, you can see the following error: \"The system version is lower than the minimum OS version specified for bundle at â€¦/Genius Scan Enterprise.app. Have 12.5.1; need 13.0\":\r\n\r\nWed Mar 3 20:52:29 2021 [292] <notice> (0x16f3cb000) -[MIClientConnection updatePlaceholderMetadataForApp:installType:failureReason:underlyingError:failureSource:completion:]: Update placeholder metadata requested by client installcoordinationd (pid 175) for app com.thegrizzlylabs.GeniusScanPro installType = 8 failureReason = 1 underlyingError = Error Domain=MIInstallerErrorDomain Code=9 \"The system version is lower than the minimum OS version specified for bundle at /private/var/installd/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installd.staging/temp.e0oYJC/extracted/Payload/Genius Scan Enterprise.app. Have 12.5.1; need 13.0\" UserInfo={LegacyErrorString=DeviceOSVersionTooLow, FunctionName=-[MIBundle isApplicableToOSVersion:error:], SourceFileLine=963, NSLocalizedDescription=The system version is lower than the minimum OS version specified for bundle at /private/var/installd/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installd.staging/temp.e0oYJC/extracted/Payload/Genius Scan Enterprise.app. Have 12.5.1; need 13.0} failureSource = 17 \r\n\r\nWhy this is critical?\r\n- This can result in document loss for the user who is unable to reinstall the app, as they won't be able to access their documents.\r\n- As an app developer, we are unable to provide a workaround.\r\n\r\nWhat should be the expected behavior:\r\n- Either iOS shouldn't offload the app if the app doesn't support the user's iOS version anymore,\r\n- Or better, when un-offloading, iOS should install the last compatible version."
