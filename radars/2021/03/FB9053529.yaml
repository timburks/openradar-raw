    description: "I have previously reported a similar issue in 2017. Apple has me there are no issues. But I am getting dozens of emails every day for the exact same issue:\r\n\r\n\r\nWCSession often fails. I keep having to tell users to restart both devices and to unpair and pair their watches again to get WatchConnectivity working. My app works for the vast majority of users, but a small percentage of users never get it to connect so they end up giving me bad reviews. I would like to verify whether the connection issues are caused by me initializing or using WCSession in a wrong way or if WCSession has bugs that Apple has not documented yet.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed analysis of the issue I have attached an Xcode project demonstrating the issue. I have also included screenshots of a user demonstrating the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated forum posts:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/662935\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/66569057/apple-watch-sends-data-but-cannot-receive-data-probably-since-watchos-7-3\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/9288\r\n\r\nSimulator-related issue: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/128205\r\n\r\nAnd dozens of other similar issues, some solved, some not so much:\r\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=wcsession+not+working&oq=wcsession+not+working"
