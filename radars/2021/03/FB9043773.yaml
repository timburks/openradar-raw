    description: "Note: Numbers correspond to the filenames of the attached screenshots/mockups.\r\n\r\nSTATUS QUO: The \"Keywords\" window has its min-width defined to be 3 buttons wide.\r\n- This is arbitrary, and makes no sense.\r\n- Means more restrictions and hence layout disadvantages than necessary without providing any design benefit I cloud think of.\r\n- When \"Info\" window with its smaller min-width on top, and \"Keyword\" window below:\r\n1) GAP to main window when aligning main window with wider \"Keywords\" window\r\n2) OVERLAP of main window when aligning main window with narrower \"Info\" window\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL: \"Keywords\" window min-width gets changed to 1 button wide as the meaningful minimum.\r\n- Then it's guaranteed that the minimum information and interaction unit of one button being guaranteed.\r\n- And it gives the user optimal layout flexibility.\r\n3) Possible to align \"Info\" and \"Keywords\" window next to min window\r\n4) Possible to make a very narrow (1 button wide) \"Keywords window next to the main window. Content is king. Keywords buttons very readable. Great layout."
