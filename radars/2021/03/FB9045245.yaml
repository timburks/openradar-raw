    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\n===\r\nThe cursor system simply does not work with SwiftUI, specially when relying on `onHover` to modify the cursor.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Open the attached project and run it\r\n2. Hover each of the buttons with the mouse pointer.\r\n3. The first button will modify the cursor appropriately\r\n4. The last 3 buttons will not since they use `onHover `\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n===\r\nAll buttons should present a `pointingHand` cursor when hovering regardless of their style.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n===\r\nThe cursor system is reset and becomes unreliable if the view updates (by applying a style, for instance)"
