    description: "Summary: When macOS 11.2.2 is installed on an external Thunderbolt 3 SSD, the Mac can boot from it properly, but only if FileVault is disabled. Once FileVault is enabled on the external drive, the Mac cannot boot and gets into a restart loop.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Attach a Thunderbolt 3 SSD.\r\n- Using Disk Utility, erase the external SSD as APFS/GUID Partition Map.\r\n- Download Big Sur 11.2.2 installer and run it, with the external SSD as the destination.\r\n- Install a fresh copy of macOS on the external SSD, all defaults, no migration.\r\n- At this point, the Mac can restart from the external SSD, and all is well.\r\n- Now, while booted from the external SSD, enable FileVault. Wait until encryption finishes.\r\n- Restart.\r\n- The Apple logo appears and the progress bar begins to fill, but then the Mac restarts in recovery mode. If I then select the external SSD as the startup volume, the cycle repeats. At no point does the login window appear, nor am I prompted to unlock the external FileVault volume.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n- When an external SSD with a properly installed copy of macOS is installed, with FileVault enabled, and that volume is selected as the startup volume, the Mac should in fact complete the startup process."
