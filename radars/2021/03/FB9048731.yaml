    description: "Trying to use Xcode to clone a repository or add a package dependency from my own site results in an alert saying “An unknown error occurred.” with the detail text “HTTP parser error: success (-1)”.\r\n\r\nURL: https://belkadan.com/source/Suffusion\r\n\r\nThe URL in question points to a gitweb site that can also be cloned directly (confirm with `git ls-remote https://belkadan.com/source/Suffusion`). Instructions for how to set up a similar site are at https://belkadan.com/blog/2020/01/Gitweb-on-Shared-Hosting/.\r\n\r\nA similar set up using nginx instead of Apache also fails with the same error: https://git.witchoflight.com/jade-rose\r\n\r\nUsing HTTP instead of HTTPS does not change the result."
