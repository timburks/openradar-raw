    description: "If you change the titlebarSeparatorStyle property of a NSSplitViewItem, the window does not update immediately. You have to set the focus to another app first for the window to update. Ans also then the window isnâ€™t update correctly. For example the shadow never really gets applied. It works if you set the property in the storyboard. But if you want to change it programatically, it does not work as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would expect something like the Finder in Big Sur: If you display the content of a Finder window as symbols, there is no shadow or line below the toolbar. If you switch to another view (like column view) a line is being added and the toolbar becomes transparent.\r\n\r\nI have added an example project to demonstrate the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/64644460/macos-11-changing-a-nssplitviewitems-nstitlebarseparatorstyle-does-not-update?noredirect=1#comment118124666_64644460\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Iomegan/SplitViewItem-titlebarSeperator"
