Build app.\r\n2. Capture photo.\r\n3. Try to share (use main AirDrop sharing option, not shortcuts to known device above) - if share popup doesn't appear once Photos permission granted please relaunch the app - it should work then.\r\n4. Get list of available/capable devices.\r\n5. Tap some device.\r\n\r\nExpected: DNG photo was transferred to selected device.\r\n\r\nActual: sharing failed, devices list closed.\r\n\r\nvariants/data-share - another branch with data not asset/file sharing (was made after Apple developer technical support) - it also not working\r\n\r\nvariants/thumbnail - version that fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nWe requested Apple Developer support and they confirmed it's iOS bug."
