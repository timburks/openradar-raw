    description: "When rendering a ZStack, if any Views with a lower `zIndex` than its siblings applies an `onHover` modifier, that closure gets called even if the View is overlayed (and potentially hidden) by other Views.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nThis is enough to exemplify the behavior:\r\n```\r\nZStack {\r\n    Rectangle()\r\n        .fill(Color.red)\r\n        .onHover { active in\r\n            if active {\r\n                fatalError(\"Shouldn't be hoverable [\\(active)]\")\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Rectangle()\r\n        .fill(Color.white)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nThe `onHover` closure shouldn't have been called (specially receiving `true` in the argument) since the view is being covered and, therefore, not actually being hovered.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe closure still get's called and receives `true` and the mouse pointer enters the view's bounds."
