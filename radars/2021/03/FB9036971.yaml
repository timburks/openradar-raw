    description: "When attempting to use CTFramesetter to layout text containing tabs, things get... weird.\r\n\r\nI've run into this bug a few different ways; I've included a swift playground showing one of them. I don't want to speculate too much, but the basic gist is that when a string contains tabs, the CTFrame object can end up with missing lines, and the lines can return unexpected results for CTLineGetStringRange.\r\n\r\nIn the provided example I would expect the line to be broken at the whitespace, and to see two visual lines, \"a\", and \"bb\"; I do see two CTLine objects but their ranges do not make sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nI encountered this error on macOS 10.14 & 10.15, and can reproduce on the simulator as well."
