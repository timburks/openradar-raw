    description: "As many people have reported on net articles like https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/672449 or https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71943(Flutter) or https://github.com/react-native-image-picker/react-native-image-picker/issues/1541(React Native), images on PHPickerViewController cannot be selected on iOS simulator on M1Mac. \r\n\r\nI also encountered this issue. This does not happen on Intel Mac with Xcode12.4, or iOS real device.\r\n\r\nI'd like this to be fixed since this annoys many people including me too much."
