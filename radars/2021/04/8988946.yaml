    description: "On a Catalyst app, the CLLocationManagerDelegate method didUpdateLocations is never called.\r\n\r\n1. I have requested permission using the requestLocation method.\r\n2. After granting it, the locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization method is called, with a positive authorizationStatus.\r\n3. There I call requestLocation on the CLLocationManager object, but neither didUpdateLocations nor didFailWithError delegate methods are called.\r\n\r\nThe same code works as expected on iOS."
