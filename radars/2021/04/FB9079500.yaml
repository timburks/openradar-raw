    description: "Environment:\r\nXcode Version 12.4 (12D4e)\r\niOS 14.4 Simulator or Device\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Download attached sample project and run on iPhone Simulator.\r\n2. Notice after 5s when the additionalSafeAreaInsets are programmatically updated the UICollectionViewOrthogonalScrollerEmebeddedScrollView doesn't size to the preferred heights of the containing cells. It remains at it's estimated height.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. This only occurs if the collection view is constrained to the top anchor of the containing view's layoutMarginsGuide.\r\n2. And if the additionalSafeAreaInsets are set after the collection view initially loads.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mdp3d49jhx64ucl/Compositional%20Layout%20Bug.zip?dl=0"
