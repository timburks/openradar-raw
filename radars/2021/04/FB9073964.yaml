    description: "How to reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave a CloudKit app with lots of historic data over a longer period of time in a given record zone. Install a fresh copy of your app in a device. Try to fetch some changes with CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation as new data arrives.\r\n\r\nObserved behavior:\r\n\r\nTo get a fresh server change token, CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation first needs to do a full history playback. This is unacceptably slow over a longer period of time, often yielding a delay of several minutes spent entirely on iCloud server side before any results are returned.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n\r\nSeveral improvements. Doing CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation for a long period of time should work faster.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, upon doing a fresh install, you often are not interested in the history (if you are, you can fetch specific pieces of history with CKQueryOperation). You would like to use CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation to receive any changes going forward. To do this, you need a fresh server change token. There should be a way to obtain the fresh token without having to do a full history playback.\r\n\r\nPossibly other changes could help here too, but in my practical experience, the combination of these two (the full playback being slow, and not being able to obtain a current token) is especially unfortunate."
