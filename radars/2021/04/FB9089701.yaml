Trigger a WebAuthn prompt in Safari on iOS 14.5.\r\n2. Wear a mask or otherwise have Touch ID fail.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n\r\n- Face ID falls back to passcode within a few seconds, especially when wearing a mask.\r\n- The passcode fallback can be used to authenticate.\r\n\r\nObserved behaviour:\r\n\r\n- Face ID takes three long fallback cycles before allowing passcode auth.\r\n- The passcode prompt is shown, but entering the correct passcode returns to WebAuthn the prompt as if no passcode was entered.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is consistent across sites and browsers."
