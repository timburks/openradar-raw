    description: "We run a 802.1x Ethernet network in our enterprise. We have a special\r\nmitigation LAN in our enterprise. Every computer who is not able to\r\njoin via 802.1x or MAC address bypass falls into this mitigation\r\nnetwork. The computers in the mitigation LAN have no Internet/Intranet\r\nconnectivity. They are only accessible for our helpdesk.\r\nThe Problem now is that our macOS computers fall into this mitigation\r\nLAN because it is not possible to force (not even with a profile) macOS\r\nclients to start a 802.1x session by themselves. Manual intervention\r\n(clicking on the \"connect\" button) is necessary otherwise the macOS\r\nclients are stuck in the mitigation LAN.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe want to force macOS to automatically connect to the Ethernet 802.1x\r\nnetwork after a reboot (without user intervention).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user has to manually connect to the 802.1X Ethernet network after\r\nevery reboot."
