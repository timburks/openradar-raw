    description: "Hello, I'd like to suggest a feature for an upcoming version of iOS:\r\nIn light of the huge market for iOS icons, customization is something that users really value. The current methods (Shortcuts, and the deprecated configuration profiles) are finnicky and don't provide a 1 to 1 replacement for default icons. \r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest an API for doing this in a clean way. It would take so much hassle out of doing something that users would really value."
