    description: "When Safari closes, (on purpose or a crash), it doesn't store which desktop each window was on, so when Safari is relaunched all windows are reopened in the current space.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Open a window, navigate to a web site.\r\n3. Open a second window, navigate to another web site, move that window to another desktop/space.\r\n4. Close Safari\r\n5. Reopen Safari, see both windows in the current space instead of each on their own space.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWindows should be reopened in the space they were in when Safari closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAll windows open in the current space. This is especially problematic when you have 30 windows spread across 5 spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nSafari Version 11.0.1 (13604.3.5)\r\nmacOS Version 10.13.1 (17B48)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nFB# FB5442741"
