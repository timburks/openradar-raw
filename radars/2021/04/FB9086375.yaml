    description: "What is happening?\r\nThere is 500ms-1 second delay before the video starts playing.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nVideo should play immediately without any lag.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n- iOS 14.4.2 (it doesn't happen on iOS 14.2)\r\n- AirPods Pro  (it doesn't happen on regular AirPods)\r\n- Another device (Macbook) paired with same AirPods. (I'm running Big Sur 11.2.3)\r\n\r\n1. Try to play the video, stop it, and play again\r\n2. You'll see a notification on the Macbook (\"Moved to iPhone\") and the video will start playing after 500ms-1 second.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't happen when I disconnect the AirPods or use other bluetooth headphones which support multiple devices so it seems like it's something with AirPods Automatic Switching introduced recently.\r\nThe issue only happens with AVPlayer. If you try this with Spotify, Youtube, TikTok etc. It works correctly.\r\n\r\nI'm playing a HLS Video so that might be a factor as well. \r\n\r\nPlease find a small repro View Controller below."
