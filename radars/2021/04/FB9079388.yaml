    description: "Our designers want our UISegmentedCoolor instances to follow internal branding guidelines. To that extent we need to set the selectedSegmentTintColor to a shade of blue; instead of the default color. In order to avoid issues with contrast we set the color of the text when selected to white.\r\n\r\nWhen the user is using very large accessibility text sizes and does a long press the largeContentViewer is displayed. However, the text color of the selected choice appears to be using the same attributes (i.e. color) of the segmented color. Show the result is white text on a white background.\r\n\r\nSee the attached images:\r\nBugWhiteText.png shows the problem\r\nBugRedText.png shows the problem as well using a different color to confirm that the text is there but drawn in the wrong color"
