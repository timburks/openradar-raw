    description: "Hi!\r\nI'm working on a networking extension for [QEMU](https://qemu.org) backed by vmnet. QEMU is distributed as source, but the com.apple.vm.networking entitlement is tied to a provisioning profile. As we can't distribute QEMU along with a developer account, we're unable to use this entitlement.\r\n\r\nOne option we're now looking at, in lieu of signing with this entitlement, is running the vmnet interface in a root-owned XPC service that communicates with the main QEMU process. Another option will be to begin distributing bespoke macOS QEMU builds signed with this entitlement, but this offers poor UX for users that want to build QEMU locally.\r\n\r\nBeing able to sign the QEMU binary with this entitlement, without needing a provisioning profile, would allow QEMU to continue being distributed as source and offer vmnet networking without requiring root access.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!"
