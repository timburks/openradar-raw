    description: "If you create an image with:\r\n [image lockFocus]; [sourceImage drawInRect:â€¦]; [image unlockFocus]\r\nAnd then you try to draw that image into a CGBitmapContext with 8 bits per component, there are rendering artifacts. It only works with 16 bits per component.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project that demonstrates the artifacts. Changing bitsPerComponent from 8 to 16 fixes it.\r\n\r\nI would expect that I could draw any CGImage into a bitmap context regardless of how it was created.\r\n\r\nIn the attached screenshot please note the artifacts on the bottom of the gradient and around the dashed line. pic.png shows the source image, which does not have those artifacts."
