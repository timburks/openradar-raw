    description: "Xcode (12.2 & 12.4) crashes when generating localized files for intent definition\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nApplication Crash\r\n\r\nWhat version of Xcode are you using?\r\nXcode 12.4 (12D4e) & Xcode 12.2 (12B45b)\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nXcode crashes when attempting to generate localized files for intent definition file.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Create new dummy Xcode project, select the app template. Create new intent definition file from SiriKit\r\n\r\n2. Add new custom intent; set category, title, and parameters in any way. Uncheck Confirmation, Widgets, and Configurable in Shortcuts. Check Suggestions and enter any phrase for the summary and description for Suggestions.\r\n\r\n3. For the new custom intent's response, configure any phrase for success and failure with any property respectively. \r\n\r\n4. When attempting to generate localized files, select localize under Localization under the File Inspector.\r\n\r\n5. Choose to localize the file under 'Base'\r\n\r\n6. Once intent definition file is generated for Base, check English to attempt to generate localized strings file for intentdefinition file.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expected the proper localized strings file with the associated intent response phrases assigned to their respective keys to be generated under the lproj directory (en.lproj in this case).\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nXcode crashes and a copy of the intent definition file is generated within the respective lproj directory (en.lproj in this case)"
