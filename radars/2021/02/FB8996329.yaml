    description: "REPRODUCTION:\r\n- Open Disk Utility 20.1 (1715.2) on macOS 11.2\r\n- Set the button bar to display \"Icons and Text\"\r\n- Click the label of any button, i.e. \"First Aid\"\r\n\r\nEXPECTED:\r\n- Clicking either the icon or text label or possibly even anything within a rectangular zone around them triggers the action, as is the UX standard in macOS apps.\r\n\r\nACTUAL:\r\n- Nothing happens.\r\n- Only clicking the icon triggers the action behind the button.\r\n- Did not have the time to test this in all first party macOS apps, but at least in Disk Utility I trapped into that usability pitfall."
