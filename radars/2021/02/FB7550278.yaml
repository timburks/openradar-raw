    description: "When working with the AVPlayer class with hls content, there are problems with changing the speed. If we show the content via airplay and try to change the speed from 1.0 to 2.0 (sometimes 1.5 or lower) the sound disappears automatically.\r\nThe rate is changed using the rate property like: playerInstance.rate = 2.0\r\nBy the debugger, during the installation the rate speed of the player changes by 2, and then automatically by 1 (visually, the stream works as if at speed 2, but in the player it is set automatically to 1). If you pause the content and then continue with the same rate, the sound and image work correctly\r\n\r\nIt is expected that when you change the speed, the sound does not disappear and the player does not automatically reset the rate to 1."
