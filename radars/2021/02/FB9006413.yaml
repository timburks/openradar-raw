    description: "REPRODUCTION:\r\n- Set your dictation locale to \"German (Austria)\".\r\n- Dictate a sentence which ends in an exclamation mark.\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL:\r\n- Siri / Dictation (also for iOS) should recognize \"Rufzeichen\" as the Austrian-German for \"Ausrufezeichen\".\r\n\r\nRATIONALE:\r\n- \"Rufzeichen\" is two syllables shorter and more convenient\r\n- No-one in Austria uses the word \"Ausrufezeichen\"\r\n- I have never heard it in my daily life nor in 8 years of academic life back in University.\r\n- Check you logs for \"Rufzeichen\" from Siri sessions from Austria. I bet that you will find plenty of \"Rufzeichen\" being spelled literally instead of being transformed to \"!\" and which people then corrected manually. Just look if you doubt it.\r\n- It's one of the more frequent used punctuation characters and I always wondered why Siri never recognized it.\r\n-- Only to realize that the official command is \"Ausrufezeichen\" as per:\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/mac-help/mh40695/11.0/mac/11.0\r\n\"Ausrufezeichen\" -> \"!\"\r\n-- Also consulted Wikipedia https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausrufezeichen\r\nThe entry paragraph mentions in bold that it's \"Rufzeichen\" in \"Österreich and Südtirol\" (Austria and South Tyrol).\r\n\r\nI hope that you have no more doubt now and change the speech recognition accordingly for people having set their language to Austrian German. This will increase Siri user satisfaction quite a lot in Austria!"
