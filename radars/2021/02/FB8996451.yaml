    description: "REPRODUCTION\r\n- Open a file in any Mac app built with normal Window manager behaviors, i.e. TextEdit, Preview, QuickTime, and most 3rd party apps.\r\n- In order to change the filename within the app context, in the window click the title or it's nearby triangle icon.\r\n- The file attribute dialog (Name, Tags, Where, Locked) opens.\r\n- Change the \"Name\" field.\r\n- Submit the change with the ENTER key.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED:\r\n- The ENTER key submits the changed name.\r\n\r\nACTUAL:\r\n- The ENTER key discards the title change.\r\n-- This contradicts macOS human interface guidelines.\r\n-- Usually ESCAPE cancels/discards and ENTER submits/saves.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n- This minimal file attribute dialog, that all standard window manager built macOS apps have integrated in the title bar, already is in macOS since ca 2012.\r\n- That annoying inconsistency exists maybe since its inception. But at least since macOS 10.15 Catalina and now under macOS 11 Bug Sur I also encountered it, 100% reproducible, but only on one particular user account. Not on freshly created users.\r\n- Interestingly this misbehavior is only in the Name field.\r\n- In the Tags field ENTER submits any tag additions/removals you have made.\r\n- I'd appreciate if this get's finally fixed, or if you tell me the rationale behind should this indeed be a conscious design decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFECTED USER ACCOUNT:\r\nThe main user, is as old as MacOS X 10.2 or 10.3 and carried over many upgrades and has a lot of customizations.\r\nIn another existing user and in a freshly created user I could not reproduce the bug!\r\nThere the ENTER key in the \"Name\" field submits as expected.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the reason? How can I isolate this? Things I could think of:\r\nIn that my main user I have some apps which may manipulate keyboard input and hence require certain privileges via System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy:\r\n- Accessibility\r\n-- Butler (for clipboard management)\r\n-- Divvy (window manager)\r\n-- Snagit (screenshots with scrolling)\r\n-- TeamViewer (not running as daemon, but I granted it privileges for on demand sessions requiring input sharing)\r\n- Input Monitoring: All only run on demand\r\n-- KeyCastr\r\n-- Google Earth Pro\r\n- Automation\r\n-- Some of my own AppleScripts I granted access to SystemEvents. But again they only run on demand.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"
