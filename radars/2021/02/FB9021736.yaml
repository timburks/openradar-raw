    description: "Zindex is ignore in UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout supplementary items in sections with an orthogonal value other than .none.\r\n\r\nIn the project, I’ve set the zIndex of the red `tlBadge` to 2, both on the layout item itself and again in the `visibleItemsInvalidationHandler` - neither of those are consistently effective at moving the item forward. Also, I’ve provided a commented out ‘fix’ for rendering the badge in `OtherBadges`, but it only fixes the rendering and NOT the hit test."
