    description: "When discovering our peripheral the scan response of this delegate contains an old data set of the previous discovery process. We did some BLE package sniffing on our end to make sure this is not an issue on the peripheral level. \r\nAs this can only be reproduced on iOS and not on Android it could be an issue on your end. \r\n```\r\npublic func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDiscover peripheral: CBPeripheral, advertisementData: [String: Any], rssi RSSI: NSNumber)\r\n``` \r\nAs CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey is default set to false it could be either the case that iOS is caching the result or the filtering of CoreBluetooth contains a bug. \r\n\r\nWe have a workaround where we set CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey too true, after we drop the first 5 results to make sure we are getting the latest result. \r\n\r\nCentral: iPhone 11 Pro / iOS 14.3\r\nPeripheral: nRF52840 Dongle"
