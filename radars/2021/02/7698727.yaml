    description: "Jul 15, 2010 at 12:42 PM\r\nSummary: Events in both my iPod Touch and iPhone Calendar are not found by search, either globally or in the application.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. With my personal data on an iPod Touch 3rd generation with iOS 4.1b, launch Calendar (alternatively do a global search from the app launcher).\r\n2. Enter “mindego” and press Search.\r\n\r\nExpected Results, and results in Snow Leopard iCal:\r\nTwo events found, 4/17/05 and 7/4/01.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing shows up in the search results, but both events are present on the device if navigated to by date, both in All on My iPhone and MobileMe.\r\n\r\nRegression: n/a\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe data was imported from my Palm by MissingSync.  Some of my personal data originated on my Newton, but not these two events.\r\nOriginally filed as 7698727 against iOS 3.1.3, and not fixed in 3.2 or 4.0.0.  Closed as a duplicate of 7028544, but not fixed in 4.1b.  Latest ICU log attached, but there doesn’t seem to be anything useful in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple\r\nJul 15, 2010 at 12:42 PM\r\nThis feedback was created from radar ID 8195301\r\n\r\nApple\r\nJul 20, 2010 at 7:22 PM\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
