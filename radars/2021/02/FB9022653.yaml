    description: "SwiftUI’s DatePicker currently only allows `date`, and `hourAndMinute` components via DatePickerComponents (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepickercomponents). It would be advantageous to also allow an `hourMinuteAndSecond` component, for feature parity with NSDatePicker’s elementFlags (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdatepicker/elementflags). \r\n\r\nCurrently I need to wrap the DatePicker with another text field to allow for users to input seconds. Adding a seconds components to the DatePicker would make this much easier."
