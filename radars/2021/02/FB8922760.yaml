    description: "REPRODUCTION\r\n- In Calendar.app (both on macOS and iOS) activate display of the holiday calendar.\r\n- In the list of calendars, activate that calendar\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL\r\n- Proposing an editorial improvement.\r\n- It would be fine if the holiday displayed could be as distinguished as possible, for Austria like i.e.:\r\nhttps://www.feiertage-oesterreich.at/2020/\r\n- The displayed data is differentiated by this data/style characteristics:\r\n-- Just the name: The holiday is common and celebrated, but NOT a public holiday.\r\n-- The name plus the suffix \"(ยง)\": This is a public holiday. It's a paid day-off for normal employees. Implicitly it is valid nation-wide.\r\n-- Location field contains comma separated regions/states: This holiday is not national but only on a regional level."
