    description: "REPRODUCTION\r\n- macOS 11.2.1 Big Sur on MacBook Pro 15'' (Mid 2014)\r\n-- But other people on the Internet with other Macs report similar experiences\r\n- Boot into a bootable USB3 attached HDD or SSD, formatted as APFS\r\n- Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault\r\n- Click \"Turn On FileVault…\", then follow the onscreen instructions until the initial encryption starts\r\n\r\nACTUAL\r\n- Encrypting is roughly only 3% (!) of maximum read/write speed\r\n\r\nEXPECTED\r\n- Ideal: Encryption automatically uses the resources more economically (as fast as possible while still not blocking the systems and not harming the CPU and storage too much, basically the fans only going a bit above maximum.\r\n- Alternative: Offer a min-max \"Speed\" slider, with some smallprint explanation text:\r\nMinimum - Your system remains almost unaffected for work, but initial encryption takes longer to finish.\r\nMaximum — Encryption finished quickly, but your system may gets less responsive drring that time. You may grab a coffee \U0001F609.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS & ATTEMPTED WORKAROUNDS\r\n- Many other people on the Internet moaned about the slow initial encryption speed, particularly when booted into external volumes.\r\n- In my case the HDD and SSD through their respective enclosure had both ca. 200-220 MB/sec for read/write performance. But during initial FileVault encryption speed only was 7-10 MB/sec, which is only a fragment of it, and the CPU only took 3-5%, fans remained at minimum 2000rpm all time. So neither CPU not storage was facilitated at all.\r\n- None of the following recommendation, which I found online, improved the speed:\r\n-- Energy saving preferences hints. Already made sure that the machine runs 24/7 during that initial encryption.\r\n-- caffeinate -> AFAIK unnecessary if Energy Saving preferences are set to 24/7 operation.\r\n-- sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0 -> Had no effect, also when removing/reattaching AC adapter on MacBook Pro (which pauses/resumes FileVault encryption)."
