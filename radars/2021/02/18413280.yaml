    description: "Summary:\r\nThe date-picker with UIDatePickerStyleInline with a hardcoded locale that has 24-hour format doesn't have 24-Hour-format values in the wheel if user's current locale has 12-hour format. But if we change the style to UIDatePickerStyleWheels all works correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable 24-Hour Time in settings. \r\n2. Create an empty project\r\n3. Add the date-picker on the screen.\r\n4. Set the date-picker style to UIDatePickerStyleInline.\r\n5. Set the date-picker locale to en_GB.\r\n6. Run the application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe date-picker allows picking the date in a 24-Hour format by spinning the wheel\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe date-picker doesn't have the 24-Hour format values in the wheel. But it's not 12-Hour-format style, because it doesn't have \"AM/PM\" tumbler. Also, if the current time is between 1 pm and 12 am, then initially the picker displays the correct 24-Hour-format date, but then when you spin the wheel there are no more 24-Hour-format values.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on iOS 14.1 and iOS 14.3"
