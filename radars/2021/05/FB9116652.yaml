    description: "*Please describe the issue:*\r\n\r\nA UIHostingController object presented modally from a UIViewController cannot be dismissed programmatically by means of `presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()`. The UIHostingController is dismissed however if it is pushed rather than presented. See https://github.com/adil-hussain-84/SwiftUIExperiments/tree/master/App2 for a small, minimal UIKit application which demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\n*Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:*\r\n\r\n1. Initialise a UIHostingController object (which has a SwiftUI root view).\r\n2. Present (modally) the UIHostingController object from a UIViewController.\r\n3. Tap a Button in the SwiftUI view contained within the UIHostingController which calls `presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()`.\r\n\r\n*What did you expect to happen?*\r\n\r\nThe UIHostingController object is dismissed.\r\n\r\n*What actually happened?*\r\n\r\nThe UIHostingController object is not dismissed."
