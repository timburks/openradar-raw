    description: "## Please describe the issue:\r\n\r\nI cannot change my in-app purchase description. App Store Review won’t approve the app until I change the in-app purchase description. However, App Store Connect says I cannot change my in-app purchase description until my app is approved. So I am in a catch 22 situation.\r\n\r\n## Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\nOpen https://appstoreconnect.apple.com\r\nClick on ‘My Apps’\r\nClick on ‘[App Name]’\r\nClick on ‘1 unresolved iOS issue’\r\nIt says ‘the display name and description for your promoted in-app purchase products are the same… please revise the display name or description for your promoted in-app purchase products to ensure each individual metadata item is unique’\r\nClick on back button\r\nIn the left hand menu click on In-App Purchases -> Manage\r\nIt says message At least one of your in-app purchases is associated with a version of an app that's not yet approved. Until this version is approved, you can't submit any changes for review.\r\nClick on in app purchases reference name ‘[In App Purchase name]’\r\nClick on App Store Information -> Localizations -> English (UK) -> Description\r\n\r\n## What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI can change the description\r\n\r\n## What actually happened?\r\n\r\nNothing, I cannot change the description"
