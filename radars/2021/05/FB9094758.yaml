    description: "Basic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nNSPersistentCloudKitContainer doesn't sync records on iCloud until switching the app to background/foreground\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nCore Data API\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- macOS Big Sur 11.3 (20E232)\r\n- Xcode 12.5 (12E262)\r\n\r\n## Description of the problem\r\n\r\n`NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` doesn't send newly created/modified/removed records to iCloud immediately. It only syncs:\r\n\r\n- When the persistent container was loaded\r\n- When the app was switched to background\r\n- When the app was switched to foreground\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this issue, I attached 2 videos:\r\n\r\n- One is with CloudKit Dashboard\r\n- Another one is with multiple Macs\r\n\r\nAlso, I attached my source code (RedirectWebForSafari.zip) that was used for the above videos.\r\nThe code creating NSPersistentCloudKitContainer is here:\r\n`RedirectWebForSafari/RedirectWebForSafari/Modules/Database/AnyCoreDataRepository.swift`\r\n\r\nHope these will be helpful.\r\n\r\n## step-by-step set of instructions to reproduce the problem\r\n\r\n1. Create `NSPersitentCloudKitContainer` object that can sync records via iCloud\r\n2. Add a record with the container's `viewContext` and do `try viewContext.save()`\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\nThe added record is uploaded to the iCloud and I can find it on CloudKit Dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nThe added record is not uploaded to the iCloud and I can't find it on CloudKit Dashboard.\r\nTo upload it, I need to change the app to background/foreground, or quit & reopen the app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, I found another person who got this issue, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/simonemontalto/status/1286659669046505472?s=21"
