    description: "Basic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nUndo/Redo of TextField and TextEditor doesn't work well\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nSwiftUI Framework\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n\r\n## My environment\r\n\r\n- macOS Big Sur 11.2.3 (20D91)\r\n- Xcode 12.5 RC (12E262)\r\n\r\n## Description of the problem\r\n\r\nLet's say there is a SwiftUI view including this code:\r\n\r\n@State var textFieldText = \"\"\r\n@State var textEditorText = \"\"\r\nvar body: some View {\r\n    VStack {\r\n        TextField(\"\", text: $textFieldText)\r\n        TextEditor(text: $textEditorText)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn this case, I confirmed that Undo/Redo of `TextField` and `TextEditor` don't work perfectly.\r\n\r\n- `TextField`: Undo/Redo doesn't work at all.\r\n- `TextEditor`: You can Undo/Redo, but you can still do that even after changing the focus to another view.\r\n\r\nI attached a video that I did the following step-by-step set. Hope it'll be helpful. \U0001F642\r\n\r\n## Step-by-step set of instructions to reproduce the problem\r\n\r\n1. Open and run the attached Xcode project (SwiftUITExtFieldCanNotUndo.zip), then you'd see a window which has 2 text boxes. The top one is `TextField` and the bottom one is `TextEditor`\r\n2. Click the first text box (`TextField`) and type \"abc\"\r\n3. Open Edit menu on the menu bar, then:\r\n  - Expected: \"Undo\" is selectable\r\n  - Reality:  \"Undo\" is unselectable\r\n5. Click the second text box (`TextEditor`) and type \"abc\"\r\n6. Open Edit menu and click \"Undo\" to make the second text box empty. \r\n7. Click the first text box again.\r\n8. Open Edit menu on the menu bar, then:\r\n  - Expected: Redo is unselectable\r\n  - Reality:  Redo is selectable and it redos the second text box even the first text box is focused"
