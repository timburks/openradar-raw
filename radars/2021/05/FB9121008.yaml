    description: "macOS sometimes shows a modal dialog such as the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nIt’s unclear to the user:\r\n\r\n* why that dialog shows up (was the user trying to launch that app? Was Finder trying to interact with it?)\r\n* what the user can do about it (could there be a relaunch button?)\r\n\r\nMoreover, while there is a Help button, it leads to an empty page (see second screenshot)."
