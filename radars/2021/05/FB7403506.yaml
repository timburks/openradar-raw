    description: "iOS version - 13.1\r\n\r\nIn certain conditions UITextView becomes blank when dismissing view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Create view controller with UITextView. Set attributed text with specified 'NSAttributedString.Key.font' attribute to the text view. It should be fairly long, for example: \"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. \".\r\n2. Modally present created view controller, i.e. by 'func present(: animated: completion:)' method of UIViewController.\r\n3. Dismiss view controller by calling 'dismiss(animated: true)' on presented view controller.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nUITextView appears blank, i.e. without text, during dismiss animation view controller. This is not apparent with default animation speed, but effect very visible after turning on Slow Animations in Simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nText is visible. As on iOS 12."
