    description: "WebM is an audiovisual media file format. It is primarily intended to offer a royalty-free alternative to use in the HTML5 video and the HTML5 audio elements. The development of the format is sponsored by Google, and the corresponding software is distributed under a BSD license. Native WebM is supported by many of the major browsers. \r\n\r\nWebM can be a container for Ogg Opus. Currently, the only way to play Ogg Opus on Mac or iOS is using CAF (Core Audio Format) files, which is used exclusively on Apple platforms.  To make applications or websites that utilize Ogg Opus audio, the files have to be doubly encoded in WebM and CAF even though the contain the exact same data.\r\n\r\nPlease support WebM on Apple platforms, both in the system APIs and Safari."
