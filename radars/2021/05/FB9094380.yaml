    description: "An equivalent of `UIViewController.hidesBottomBarWhenPushed` is missing in SwiftUI. The current workaround is to wrap the TabView in a top-level NavigationView responsible for all navigation, which goes against the principles of Master-Detail navigation and I've found causes strange race conditions in complex apps handling a significant amount of state.\r\n\r\nI believe a modifier that bridges the original `UIViewController.hidesBottomBarWhenPushed` property onto the SwiftUI View it's applied to would solve the issue gracefully."
