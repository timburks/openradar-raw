    description: "Which part of Find My are you seeing issues with?\r\n• Items\r\n\r\nWhat is the Apple ID you are signed in with when you encounter this issue?\r\n• Any\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n\r\nA user should be able to hide AirTags location from themselves when they loan a tagged item to a friend. For example, I have an AirTag in my car. I loan my car to my brother. I don't need to know where he's going, so I should be able to disable the location on my AirTag for a given length of time, (variable options, say 6, 12, 24 hours, or even an until date). If he doesn't return in the assumed time, the location will turn back on and I can check to see if he's made a run for and left the country with my car.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be great if I could pass the location info to my brother for the set time above. That would be related to FB9098024."
