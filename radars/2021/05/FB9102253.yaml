    description: "I am providing a GraphicRectangular complication in my app, via CLKComplicationTemplateGraphicRectangularFullImage, and I would like to have the complication accessible to my blind users, as I have gone to great lengths to make the app blind-friendly.\r\n\r\nI set accessibilityLabel of my CLKImageProvider (this is the only place where I seem to be able to set the accessibility label to a complication), but this label is ignored by VoiceOver - VoiceOver just reads an app name instead of my provided accessibility label.\r\n\r\nvar imageProvider = CLKFullColorImageProvider(/* graphical weather forecast */)\r\nimageProvider.accessibilityLabel = “A string describing the weather represented in chart”\r\n\r\nlet template = CLKComplicationTemplateGraphicRectangularFullImage()\r\ntemplate.imageProvider = imageProvider\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nVoiceOver reads my provided accessibilityLabel\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nVoiceOver reads just the name of the app which provides the complication. This even applies to some system provided complications (now playing, weather)."
