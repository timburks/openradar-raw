    description: "# Basic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nSuggestion: more system settings accesible through Shortcuts\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nShortcuts\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nSuggestion\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nDear Apple Feedback Team:\r\n\r\nIt would be very convenient for users to be able to adjust Apple Watch System Settings via shortcuts.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nNew actions, like “set Apple Watch orientation to left/right wrist” and “set Apple Watch orientation to Digital Crown on the left/right”.\r\nThis would enable users that constantly change its Apple Watch from the right wrist to left wrist and viceversa to create a shortcut like “Hey Siri, left wrist”, to very quickly set the correct Apple Watch orientation.\r\n\r\nIt is a convenience for users.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, I think that most, if not all system settings should be accesible via Shorcuts.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. Kind regards."
