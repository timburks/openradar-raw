    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onchange(of:initial:_:)-8wgw9\r\n\r\nThe docs on this page under the Parameters section state:\r\n\"initial: Whether the action should be run when this view initially appears.\"\r\n\r\nHowever this is not the case. In my testing, the action is run every time the view appears not just when it initially appears. This can be demonstrated with below code, when navigating back the onChange action runs again, the same as onAppear.\r\n\r\nI would suggest changing the documentation to be:\r\ninitial: Whether the action should be run every time this view appears\r\n\r\nThe param would actually be better named appear instead of initial. If however the description is correct and it is the behaviour that is wrong then please let me know and I will submit a SwiftUI feedback report so we can get it fixed.\r\n\r\nimport SwiftUI\r\n\r\nstruct AppearTest {\r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n        \r\n        var body: some View {\r\n            NavigationStack {\r\n                VStack {\r\n                    NavigationLink(destination: Text(\"Pushed Text\")) {\r\n                        Text(\"Push a View\")\r\n                    }\r\n                    .padding()\r\n                }\r\n                .onAppear {\r\n                    print(\"onAppear\")\r\n                }\r\n                .onChange(of: 0, initial: true) {\r\n                    print(\"onChange initial\") // has same behaviour as onAppear\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}"
