    description: "The following library modification requests are idempotent:\r\n- Add Tracks to a Library Playlist:`https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library/playlists/{id}/tracks`\r\n- Add a Resource to a Library: `https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library`\r\n\r\nFrom https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent:\r\n> An HTTP method is idempotent if the intended effect on the server of making a single request is the same as the effect of making several identical requests.\r\n> [â€¦]\r\n> All safe methods are idempotent, as well as `PUT` and `DELETE`. The `POST` method is not idempotent.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above library modification requests are idempotent, they use the `POST` method indicating to the developer that they are not idempotent and preventing compliant HTTP libraries from retrying the request when needed. Instead, those requests should use the `PUT` method to indicate that they are idempotent."
