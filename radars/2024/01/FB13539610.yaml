    description: "Dear Apple Team,\r\n\r\nI propose an accessibility enhancement for the Apple Watch: a virtual button feature on the touchscreen adjacent to the digital crown. This feature would emulate the functionality of the digital crown, catering to users who, due to motor strength or dexterity limitations, find it challenging to press the crown physically.\r\n\r\nThe addition of this virtual button would not only advance the Apple Watch's accessibility but also reflect Apple's commitment to inclusive design. It would be particularly beneficial for individuals with reduced motor strength or fine motor skills, like my wife, and others facing similar challenges.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the intricacies of such an integration, I have confidence in Apple's capability to evaluate and implement this feature while upholding the aesthetic and functional standards of the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your consideration of this suggestion and am open to further discussions or participation in user testing as needed.\r\n\r\nBest regards."
