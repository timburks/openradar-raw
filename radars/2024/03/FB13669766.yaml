    description: "Multiline UILabel with limited height has wrong first/last baseline anchors. When the height constraint isn't a multiple of label's line height then first/last baseline anchors are misplaced. \r\n\r\nSteps: \r\n- Create a multiline label with height constraint. \r\n- Add first/last baseline constraint to another view \r\n* clearly visible when dynamic font in use \r\n\r\nExpected result: correct position of view that has constraint to the first/last baseline of label \r\nActual result: first/last baseline of label are misplaced like the views constrained to them. \r\n\r\nXcode version: 15.2"
