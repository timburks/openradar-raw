    description: "* Please describe the issue:\r\nWhen using Swift Playgrounds app (both on macOS and iPad), the application fails to run playground page if it contains function annotated with @inlinable. The app itself won't crash but the compiler will. Console.app on macOS is full of crash reports. It's hard to find why the page won't run because playgrounds will not mark problematic part of the code.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nCreate an empty playground on iPad or macOS and write function annotated with @inlinable, for example:\r\n\r\n@inlinable\r\nfunc thisShouldWork() {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nThen click on 'Run My Code'\r\n\r\n* What did you expect to happen?\r\nThe app will compile and run given code.\r\n\r\n* What actually happened?\r\nThe compiler fails to compile the code and crashes. The app continues to run and shows 'There was a problem running this page.' error modal. Note that annotating variables inside struct works and compiles."
