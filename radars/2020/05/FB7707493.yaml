    description: "If you subclass UITextField in order to listen for deleteBackward() on UIKeyInput this only works with the native keyboard. I've tried various custom keyboard extensions and none of them trigger deleteBackwards when deleteBackwards is pressed on the keyboard. \r\n\r\nTo recreate try this:\r\n\r\nclass MyTextFieldSubclass: UITextField {\r\n    override func deleteBackward() {\r\n          // This should be called on delete backwards but it's not.\r\n         super.deleteBackward()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nNote. I've only tested it with \r\nkeyboardType = .numberPad"
