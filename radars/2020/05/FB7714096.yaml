    description: "I noticed a bug in tableview's keyboard handling when the navigation gesture to go back is being used. When you have a screen and you push on another that has a table with text field in the rows and a text field is selected thus keyboard appears and the table is resized to be smaller so you can still scroll to all rows, this resizing is broken if you start a back gesture and then cancel it thus remain on the same screen, the table is now the full screen size and thus the rows are now obscured by the keyboard and can not be scrolled to.  I've attached a sample app that demonstrates the issue and also a screen capture video. After launching it on iPhone simulator (iPad is not affected) the steps are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Tap Next.\r\n2. Tap Row 1's Placeholder, keyboard appears (if it doesn't check Simulator keyboard settings).\r\n3. Scroll to Row 25 and back to Row 1.\r\n4. Begin a navigate back gesture but cancel it to stay on this screen.\r\n5. Try again to scroll to Row 25, you can no longer reach it.\r\n\r\nXcode 11.4.1\r\niPhone Simulator 13.5"
