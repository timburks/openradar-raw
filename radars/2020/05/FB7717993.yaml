Run it in iOS Simulator for iPad.\r\n\r\nIn short: When you enter an accented character via marked text at the end of a text view and then hit ⌘Z, an exception is raised.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the crash, simply follow these steps (assumes a US keyboard layout):\r\n• Run this sample project in the iOS Simulator for iPad.\r\n• Click the “Capture Keyboard” button in the toolbar of the simulator (not sure if this is necessary, but keyboard shortcuts seem to work more reliable with this activated).\r\n• There’s a text view shown. At the end of the text, type ⌥E to insert an accent character (´). Note that the text view inserts the accent as marked text.\r\n• Type e so the marked text is replaced with é\r\n• Hit ⌘Z to undo\r\n• Crash \U0001F4A5\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nUndo the change.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nCrash.\r\n\r\nTested on in iOS Simulator for iPad Air (3rd generation), iOS 13.5, Xcode 11.5 (11E608c)"
