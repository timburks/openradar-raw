    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nMethods of SFSafariTab and  needs @available(OSX 10.14.4, *)\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nSafariServices\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nApplication Crash\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCurrently (macOS 10.15 SDK, Xcode 11.5), for example, navigate(to:) in SFSafariTab is defined like this:\r\n\r\n>    /// Navigates this tab to the given URL. The extension doesn't need permission to access the URL to navigate to it.\r\n>    open func navigate(to url: URL)\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the following documentation, it's actually available from macOS 10.14.4:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafaritab/3075412-navigate\r\n\r\nSo, I think this should be defined like this:\r\n\r\n@available(OSX 10.14.4, *)\r\nopen func navigate(to url: URL)\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of this issue, I didn't get any compile error and I released my Safari extension including it even for macOS 14.0 users and one of them reported it didn't work. He sent me a log with Console.app and the extension surely crashed because of this issue: \r\n\r\n> default\t18:01:20.481009 +0300\tTranslateWebForSafari Extension\t-[SFSafariTab navigateToURL:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x6000036f2620\r\n\r\nNot only this, SFSafariPage's getContainingTab(completionHandler:) also has the same issue. I also found it from his log:\r\n\r\n> default\t18:01:21.091526 +0300\tTranslateWebForSafari Extension\t-[SFSafariPage getContainingTabWithCompletionHandler:]: unrecognized selector sent to \r\n\r\nI didn't check in detail but maybe there are other methods like these.\r\n\r\nFYI, this is his bug report: \r\nhttps://github.com/mshibanami/TranslateWebForSafari/issues/1"
