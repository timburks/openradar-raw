Go to Settings | Privacy | Location Services | Safari Websites and change the setting to \"Never\".\r\n2. Wait a couple months to forget you've done this.\r\n3. Go to https://geolocation-debug.glitch.me\r\n4. Click the \"aA\" button in the address bar, go to \"Website Settings\", and set Location to \"Allow\".\r\n5. Click the \"Call getCurrentPosition()\" button.\r\n6. Notice that the call is denied.\r\n\r\nThis was very confusing. There should be some indication that Safari itself is disallowed from using location, rather than letting users set a website setting that Safari can't honor."
