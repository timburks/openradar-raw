    description: "While Foundation's JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject:) *does* specify that the resulting data is encoded in UTF-8, JSONEncoder.encode(_:) *does not*.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because it means the following code sample from the JSONEncoder page (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonencoder) and several third-party Codable tutorials is not necessarily correct:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet data = try encoder.encode(pear)\r\nprint(String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)!)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelying on the JSON spec alone, the data could be UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.\r\n\r\nIn practice, JSONEncoder appears to be implemented using JSONSerialization (on Darwin and Linux) and people rely on this, so I wouldn't expect the encoding of the returned data to change any time soon. It would still be nice if JSONEncoder's returned data encoding was documented though."
