    description: "Sometime in the last few months my Safari bookmarks stopped syncing to either of my iOS 10 devices.  I eventually got desperate enough to try the usual FAQ last resort of deleting all bookmarks from my iPad, and then reenabling iCloud sync for it.  That didnâ€™t help, and now I have no bookmarks on it, and the bookmarks on my iPhone are months out of date.\r\n\r\nBroken: iOS 10.3.3 14G60 on iPhone 6S; iPad IPAD Mini 4 WI-FI, Cellular\r\nWorks:  MacOS 10.13.6 17G12034 MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015); 10.14.6 (18G4032) MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\r\n(sysdiagnose_2020.05.17_16-29-27-0400.tar.gz)"
