    description: "I recently updated Xcode from version 11.3 to 11.5 and one of my packages (that I use in one of my app, I developed both the app and the package) can't compile because of a permission error:\r\n```\r\nerror: unable to open dependencies file (/Users/arguiot/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Euclid_Calculator-esmjlsretjpuvpajvqzmllnvcpse/Build/Intermediates.noindex/Euler.build/Debug/Euler.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/Fibonacci-PACKAGE:https://github.com/arguiot/Euler::MAINGROUP::REF_0::REF_32.d) (in target 'Euler' from project 'Euler')\r\nCommand CompileSwiftSources emitted errors but did not return a nonzero exit code to indicate failure\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to be an Xcode problem (or `xcodebuild` toolchain) because the `swift build` command seems to work on the package. Unfortunately, there is no way of using the same command for my app, I have to use Xcode.\r\n\r\nOne obvious solution is to use Xcode 11.3 but WWDC and iOS 14 are coming and I don't want to be in a situation where I can't use the new features.\r\n\r\nI already tried \"common\" stuff like cleaning the build folder, switching the build system to the legacy build system, ...\r\n\r\nI also tried to give read & write access to everyone on the DerivedData folder (and subfolders)."
