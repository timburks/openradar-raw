    description: "Icons from the Launchpad can get permanently stuck on the screen, requiring one of a few obscure workarounds or a logout to correct.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Launchpad.\r\n2. Search for an app that’s not on the current page.\r\n3. Drag the app away and then quickly release it.\r\n4. The icon may get stuck permanently on the screen, on top of all windows.\r\n5. To make it go away, one can:\r\n• Enter wiggly “move mode” in Launchpad\r\n• Kill the Dock or Finder process\r\n\r\nSee this link for various versions of step 5: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/221613/macos-app-icon-stuck-on-my-screen\r\nAs of this feedback, the linked StackExchange question has 44 votes and its top-voted solution has 83, indicating that this is not an obscure problem.\r\n\r\nAlso see attached recording."
