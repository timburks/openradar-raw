    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nXcode doesn't use selected toolchain to resolve swift packages\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat version of Xcode are you using?\r\nXcode 11.4.1\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nWhen using the Swift 5.3 development snapshot dated May 4, 2020.\r\n\r\nI am attempting to try out the new Swift Package Manager resources from SE-0271, which is included in the latest toolchains for Swift 5.3. However Xcode fails to resolve the swift packages with the following error:\r\n\r\n/Users/danielctull/Developer/Advent of Code/Package.swift: package at '/Users/danielctull/Developer/Advent of Code' is using Swift tools version 5.3.0 but the installed version is 5.2.0\r\n\r\nThe project can be found at https://github.com/danielctull/advent-of-code, I have attached a zip of the directory of the package and you can see it runs successfully using the Swift 5.3 nightly docker image here: https://github.com/danielctull/Advent-of-Code/runs/648828041\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Download and install the Swift 5.3 toolchain\r\n2. Select this toolchain in Xcode\r\n3. Open the supplied Advent of Code package\r\n4. See the error about the Package.swift using 5.3 but the installed version being 5.2.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expected Xcode to be able to build packages which require features found in the Swift 5.3 development toolchain I had downloaded by using that toolchain to resolve the swift package.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nFailure to resolve package manifest and thus a failure to build anything."
