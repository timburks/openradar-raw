    description: If you open two editors and the project navigator on a 13" notebook, the majority of files in project navigator look likes this "V....swift" which is anything but useful. This is not because the sidebar would be too small, the full file name would fit easily but the file is 3 levels deep and the sidebar has no horizontal scrolling, despite Apples mice and trackpads having optimal support for this feature.
