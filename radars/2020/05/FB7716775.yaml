Click \"Don't allow\".\r\n7. Reload.\r\n8. Click the \"Call getCurrentPosition()\" button.\r\n9. Notice that it denies geolocation without prompting. (This is reasonable.)\r\n10.

Notice that it says \"Location: Ask\", which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nChanging the location setting to \"allow\" does allow use of the API.
