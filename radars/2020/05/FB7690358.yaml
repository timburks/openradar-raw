    description: "Which preference pane are you seeing issues with?\r\nSecurity & Privacy\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nWhen an application is attempting to install a DriverKit System Extension (dext), the “System Extension Blocked” popup appears. Upon clicking “Open Security Preferences,” one would expect to be taken to the UI for authorising the system extension. If the System Preferences app was already open on the “Security & Privacy” pane, this user interface does not appear until navigating to the overview and re-entering the pane. It is neither clear from the UI that this is required, nor is it clear why it should be required even once you know what to do.\r\n\r\nSee attached screen recording.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch an application which installs a dext. (A demo app is attached in both binary and source forms; the binary is signed with a development certificate, so kext/dext signature checks in SIP must be disabled, and the amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1 boot-arg must be set.)\r\n2. Ensure the System Preferences.app is launched and that the Security & Privacy pane is open.\r\n3. Perform whatever steps necessary in the app to trigger a dext activation request. (In the DemoDriver app, hit “Install Dext”)\r\n4. Receive the “System Extension Blocked” popup.\r\n5. Click “Open Security Preferences”\r\n6. Focus shifts to the System Preferences app\r\n\r\nExpected: Ability to approve the extension\r\n\r\nActual: Approval UI is missing until user navigates away from security pane and re-enters it.\r\n\r\nThis affects the current release macOS 10.15.4 (19E387) and current beta 10.15.5 (19F72f) versions, and likely all earlier macOS 10.15.x releases.\r\nFile Uploads\r\nSystem_Profile_full.spx\r\nsysdiagnose_2020.05.06_15-58-26+0200_Mac-OS-X_Macmini6-2_19F72f.tar.gz\r\nno-dext-consent-when-pane-open.mov\r\nDemoDriver.zip\r\nDemoDriver-source.zip"
