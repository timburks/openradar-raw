    description: It would be useful for AVComposition (and AVVideoComposition) to be able to conform to NSCoding so that it can be persisted for use between app sessions. The best workaround for this currently seems to be to define an identical API on top of AVComposition which conforms to NSCoding, and then have a way to generate an AVComposition off of this identical API. It's a bit cumbersome and requires maintenance as new features of AVComposition are exercised.
