    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\n\r\nWhen I’ve been rewriting code from completion handlers to ObservableObject I crashed the compiler, seg fault 11 is the result.\r\n\r\n- It only happens for the @Published property\r\n- @State property is fine and the compiler throws an error “Invalid redeclaration of ***”\r\n- Other (custom) property wrappers work fine too and throw proper human readable error.\r\n\r\nTools:\r\n\r\n- Xcode Version 11.4.1 (11E503a)\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\nJust try to build the attached project and a set fault is thrown.\r\n\r\nIf it is Xcode project instead fo the package it behaves the same.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nProper human readable error in the form “Invalid redeclaration of ***”\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n\r\nCompiler crash.\r\n\r\nMinimal code required to reproduce this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Combine\r\n\r\nclass NumberObservableObject: ObservableObject {\r\n\r\n    @Published var number: Int = 0\r\n\r\n    func number() {}\r\n}\r\n```"
