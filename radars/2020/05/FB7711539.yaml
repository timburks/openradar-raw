    description: "Since iOS 13.5\r\nWhen dragging a subview from a UIView:\r\n- The lift preview is fine and correctly positioned\r\n- When the drag of a subview starts, the preview works as expected\r\nWhen dragging an arranged subview from a UIStackView:\r\n- The lift preview is fine and correctly positioned\r\n- When the drag of an arranged UIView starts, the preview comes \"flying in\" from the right side of the screen\r\n- Expected behavior is the same from using a UIView as a container for subviews.\r\n\r\nIn the example attached you can clearly see the behavior when running the code in iOS 13.5.\r\nWhen using previous versions of iOS this behavior does not occur"
