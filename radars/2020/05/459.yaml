    description: "When we write a keypath that accesses a computed property that performs a cast to another type inside, the framework and the app compiles properly, but the Unit Test framework fails with Segmentation Fault: 11.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. uncompress the attached project (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Yk4NGpgBzasXkEexZ562yVTemyUZRpCc).\r\n2. open the attached project. I used Xcode 11.4.1 (11E503a) and macOS Catalina 10.15.4\r\n3. build the framework (cmd + B). It will compile successfully\r\n4. build the unit tests (cmd + shift + U). The compiler will fail with segmentation fault 11."
