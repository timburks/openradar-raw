    description: "I'm working on creating a Mac Catalyst version of an iPadOS app I'm building now. Using QLThumbnailProvider, I was able to get thumbnail generation for the custom file formats my app supports working with no issue in the Files app on iOS and iPadOS.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I go to embed my Thumbnails extension in my Mac Catalyst build target, I get the build error: 'Thumbnails.appex' is a Thumbnail extension, which is not available when building for Mac Catalyst. You may need to restrict the platforms for which this app extension should be embedded in the target editor.\r\n\r\nPlease consider allowing iOS thumbnail extensions to work with Mac Catalyst applications in a future software release.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!"
