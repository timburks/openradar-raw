    description: "On a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar the Keyboard preference pane now allows the option to switch to F1, F2 etc. keys for all apps, as requested by rdar://32719268. This is good.\r\n \r\nThe problem is there's a weird behavior when screen sharing is used to open the pane:\r\n1. Control the MacBook Pro using Screen Sharing.\r\n2. Close System Preferences if open.\r\n3. Wait a minute until the Touch Bar goes completely black.\r\n4. Using the screen sharing, open System Preferences, and\r\n5. Switch to the Keyboard pane.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard pane will be the same as the one on non-Touch Bar apps. But this doesn't actually work on the Touch Bar Mac. For example, if you now use the checkbox \"Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" to toggle the function keys, it has no effect, even if you use the MacBook Pro keyboard rather than Screen sharing.\r\n\r\nThis pane is persistent: once the non-Touch Bar pane appears, it will continue to display even if you switch to other panes and back using the Touch Bar MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nNote: It may be that it isn't really Screen Sharing that triggers the problem. It could be that it is related to starting the Keyboard pane when the Touch Bar is black, but it is harder to do that without using Screen Sharing."
