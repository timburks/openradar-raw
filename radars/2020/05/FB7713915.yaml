When you have a screen that uses a nav bar button to push on a second screen, if a back gesture is started then cancelled, and then the user does go back to first screen, that nav bar button is greyed out making it look disabled. I've attached a sample app that demonstrates the issue and also a screen capture. After launching it on iPhone simulator the steps are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Tap Next.\r\n2. On left edge of screen begin a drag to go back gesture but cancel it to remain on this screen.  \r\n3. Go back to previous screen either by doing a drag gesture or tapping the back button.\r\n4. Bug is that the Next button is now greyed out as if it is disabled but it still works.\r\n\r\nXcode 11.5\r\niOS Simulator 13.5"
