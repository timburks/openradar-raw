    description: "We created an app that opens a second screen showing a Collection view (PhotosViewController) displaying images of the phones photo library\r\nWe use the recommended PHCachedImageManager to retrieve the images from Photos library (See attached project)\r\n\r\nWe saw that when opening and closing the collection view multiple times the memory usage of the app grows. This eventually leads to the app being killed by the OS because it uses too much memory.\r\n\r\nOur investigations showed us that the PHCachedImageManager referenced in the collection view is still in memory even though the  PhotosViewController is already deallocated.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproducing using the apache Project\r\n\r\n* Grant photos permission to the app (app may be restarted)\r\n\r\n* tap “show photos”\r\n* tap back to close the\r\n* open “Debug memory graph” in Xcode\r\n* filter for “PHCachedImageManager”\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\nPHCachedImageManager is NOT allocated although PhotosViewController is already deallocated which is the only instance holding a reference\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nPHCachedImageManager is still allocated although PhotosViewController is already deallocated which is the only instance holding a reference"
