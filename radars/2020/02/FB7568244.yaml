    description: When viewing my submitted feedback, I can use the search field to filter for specific components, but it would be nice™ if I could group my feedback by component too, either in a standard table (like Mail’s classic mode) or in scrollable sections (like an iOS table, or like Finder’s “Group By” view setting in List view).
