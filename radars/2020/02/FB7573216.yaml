    description: "Calling the MKMapItem.openMaps when Apple Maps app is uninstalled from the device will cause the system alert that proposes to restore the Apple Maps to appear twice.\r\n\r\nCalling MKMapItem.openMaps(with: [sourceMapItem, destinationMapItem], launchOptions: [MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeKey: MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeDriving]) to open the Apple Maps with the route from the source to the destination, when the Apple Maps app is uninstalled will cause the Maps restoration alert to be called twice or even three times in a row. Two times it flashes immediately and one more time after selecting one of the options."
