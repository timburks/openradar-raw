    description: "Feedback Assistant marks beta release notes as unread, which then show up with an indicator icon in both the app’s sidebar and the Dock. But not only do I get let down when I see an unread message that turns out to be release notes, I’m not a watchOS developer, and so having that be “unread” isn’t useful to me.\r\n\r\nI /also/ think they should be categorized separately from “Inbox”, but that’s less important."
