    description: "Starting in iOS 13.4 (as of build 17E5223h), calling SSReadingList.default()?.addItem(...) prompts the user to confirm adding the webpage to Safari Reading List.\r\n\r\nI can appreciate the need to confirm user consent before saving arbitrary webpages from an app to a user’s Safari Reading List. But please provide a way for a user to indicate that an app is allowed to add webpages to Safari Reading List without being prompted every time. An “Always Allow” option in that alert would avoid unnecessary alerting while also limiting the ability of apps to spam users’ Safari Reading Lists.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Run the attached sample app on a device running iOS 13.4.\r\n2. Tap “Save to Safari Reading List”. Observe that you are prompted for permission to add a webpage to Safari Reading List.\r\n3. Tap “Add”.\r\n4. Tap “Save to Safari Reading List” again. Observe that you are prompted for permission for the same app to add a webpage to Safari Reading List.\r\n5. Run the attached sample app on a device running iOS 13.3.1.\r\n6. Observe that an app can add webpages to Safari Reading List without being prompted at all, resulting in a nicer experience.\r\n\r\nThis is a big issue for reading apps, where the customer might want to add lots of webpages to Safari Reading List."
