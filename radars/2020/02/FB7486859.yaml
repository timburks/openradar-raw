    description: "Users are unable to select multiple folders in UIDocumentPickerViewController on iOS 13.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have 2 folders in your iCloud Drive.\r\n2. Open the sample app. (Make sure you are signed in to iCloud.)\r\n3. Tap the button.\r\n4. Tap \"select\" to enter the multi-item selection mode.\r\n5. Verify you are not able to select the two folders.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from iOS 12. If you follow the steps above using a device running iOS 12, you will see on step 5 that you are able to select the folders.\r\n\r\nSample app code here: https://github.com/addisonwebb/FB7486859"
