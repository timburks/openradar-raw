    description: I have a hotkey for “copy area of the screen to clipboard”, which is the usual way I take screenshots. This is a little more featured than the screenshot button in the New Problem window since it allows quickly capturing an entire window. I expected to be able to just Paste that in on either the Attach files screen or even the Description screen, but no such luck. I had to save it first.
