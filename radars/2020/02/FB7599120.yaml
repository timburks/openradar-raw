    description: "All the time getting an error for some iCloud accounts when trying download photos from iCloud because the photos are not presented locally on a device. The error occurs for some iCloud photos:\r\n\r\nError Domain=CloudPhotoLibraryErrorDomain Code=25 \"Failed to download CPLResourceTypeOriginal for ARUQNQfwZKmf/HcerGPjcRjjf1/H#PrimarySync (Record not found)\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Failed to download CPLResourceTypeOriginal for ARUQNQfwZKmf/HcerGPjcRjjf1/H#PrimarySync (Record not found)}\r\n\r\niOS Settings -> Photos has iCloud Photos enabled. Also in iCloud settings the iCloud is on for Photos app.\r\n\r\nThe code I use to export photos:\r\n\r\nlet options = PHImageRequestOptions()\r\noptions.version = .original\r\noptions.isSynchronous = false\r\noptions.isNetworkAccessAllowed = true\r\noptions.deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat\r\nlet id = PHImageManager.default().requestImageDataAndOrientation(for: asset, options: options) { data, _, _, info in { /*...*/ }\r\n\r\nAfter I deleted some photos and added some new, seems the error has gone on my devices. But my clients (users) sometimes see this error and I cannot figure out what to suggest them to fix the error."
