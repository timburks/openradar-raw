    description: "When filing a new Feedback, Feedback Assistant automatically collects a sysdiagnose. This is good for parallelism and a reasonable default behavior across users, but when submitting something like *this* Feedback, it’s just wasted time and network traffic. A user who knows what a sysdiagnose is should be able to cancel it—or, if that’s not reasonable given the way the sysdiagnose command works, turn off the behavior where it automatically starts.\r\n\r\nBonus: allow attaching a system profile instead, like Radar, since a sysdiagnose can be very slow if your computer has had a lot of activity recently.\r\n\r\nRunning macOS Catalina 19C57.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have since discovered that clicking “Continue” before the sysdiagnose has finished allows submitting a Feedback without the sysdiagnose (FB7568244). This isn’t very discoverable, though, and I don’t entirely trust Feedback Assistant not to try to attach it *anyway,* post-submission, in the background."
