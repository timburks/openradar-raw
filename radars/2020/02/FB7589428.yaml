    description: "I’m embedding Sparkle in my application, and currently doing so with a project reference under my top-level xcodeproj-also-serving-as-a-workspace. However, this means when I build my application in Debug mode, Sparkle.framework also gets built in Debug. It would be nice™ if the “Configurations” section of the Project Editor allowed selecting a configuration to use for referenced projects. This would also be helpful if the top-level project had configurations that didn’t exist in the referenced project.\r\n\r\nObviously this gets tricky for projects at the same level in the workspace hierarchy, but it seems reasonable when they’re nested like this."
