    description: The new simctl privacy command does not support setting the notification permission. This is a great new addition and will remove the need for 3rd party tools to set system permissions before running automated testing. The ability to set the notification permission is a necessity before running any tests that might trigger the notification request. Given that developers are encouraged to request updated permission all the time, this prompts the system alert quite frequently and is a blocker for unit and UI tests. Please consider updating this command to include the notification permission. It could be added all as one or split into notifications-local and notifications-remote to separate the different requests.
