    description: "The Downloads page on https://developer.apple.com/download/more do not provide a resource to be able to build Playground Books using Xcode 11.3. The current list stops at 11.1.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, it is not possible to build the projects since the PlaygroundBluetooth and PlaygroundSupport do not support Swift 5.1.3\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n- Navigate to https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=Swift%20Playgrounds%20Author%20Template\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nThe download pages should provide a Download option for Xcode 11.3 and the current Xcode Beta 11.4\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe last download option is for Xcode 11.1\r\n\r\nIf one tries to build the project on Xcode 11.3, they will be presented with the error:\r\n\r\nmodule compiled with Swift 5.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1.3 compiler: $HOME/Swift_Playgrounds_Author_Template_for_Xcode_11.1/Template/SupportingContent/PlaygroundsFrameworks/iphonesimulator/PlaygroundSupport.framework/Modules/PlaygroundSupport.swiftmodule/x86_64-apple-ios-simulator.swiftmodule\r\n\r\n\r\nComment added Feb 18, 2020 at 9:38 PM:\r\nThe latest provided template is still invalid: https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Swift_Playgrounds_Author_Template_for_Xcode_11.3/Swift_Playgrounds_Author_Template_for_Xcode_11.3.xip\r\n\r\nThis download also gives the issue \"~/Swift_Playgrounds_Author_Template_for_Xcode_11.3/Template/PlaygroundBook/Modules/BookCore.playgroundmodule/Sources/LiveViewSupport.swift:9:8: error: module compiled with Swift 5.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1.3\""
