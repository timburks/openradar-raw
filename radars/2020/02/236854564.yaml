    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you create a swift class that inherits from UIButton and then subclass it once more(eg. UIButton > MYButton > MyButtonSubclass), then set the interface builder's button's class to the secondary class(MyButtonSubclass) you receive a warning in the interface builder on any currently set events (eg. Touch Down) saying, \"(MyButtonSubclass) is no longer a valid event source.\" If you build and run the project you will notice that the event method is still called when the button is pressed. This happens in both Xib and Storyboard files. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Obj-c View Controller with xib\r\n2. Create a button in the interface builder\r\n3. Connect button to action event\r\n4. Create a Swift UIButton subclass\r\n5. Subclass custom button class\r\n6. Set the Button element's class in the interface builder to my swift button (tested in a Storyboard as well)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button element in the interface builder should keep it UIButton event hookups when a UIButton is subclassed two levels deep.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou  will receive a warning in the interface builder on any currently set events (eg. Touch Down) saying, \"(eg. MyButtonSubclass) is no longer a valid event source.\" If you build and run the project you will notice that the event method is still called when the button is pressed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/46jn20fxu0oxhkl/InpectableBug.zip?dl=0"
