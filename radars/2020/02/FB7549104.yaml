    description: "# Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n0. Set your tab width to 2 spaces (Xcode > Preferences > Text Editing > Indentation)\r\n1. Make a new project in a git repo.\r\n2. Add a file that uses tabs for indentation, and commit it.\r\n3. Change one of the lines that has tabs in it.\r\n4. Click on the change bar on the left of the editor and choose “Show Change”\r\n\r\n# What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nThe tabs in the old code and the new code both use 2 as the indent width.\r\n\r\n# What actually happened?\r\n\r\nThe tabs in the old code use 4 as the indent width. The new code correctly uses 2."
