    description: "A new feature was added in Catalina that lets the user use their local user account password (or Touch ID) to log into Apple websites when that local user account is logged in with iCloud. \r\n\r\nThis is undesired behavior for users who use third-party password managers. Safari takes several seconds to load the custom authentication UI and then the user has to click \"Cancel\" to display the normal username and password fields on the website. This makes the process of logging in much longer than it would be if Safari didn't show custom authentication UI.\r\n\r\nIt is highly annoying that Safari treats Apple websites differently than any other website.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n1. Navigate to an Apple website where you can log in with your Apple ID. (appleid.apple.com, developer.apple.com, etc.)\r\n2. Wait for Safari to present custom login UI.\r\n3. Click \"Cancel\".\r\n4. Wait for webpage to load username/password text fields.\r\n5. Use third-party password manager to fill form.\r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\nAdd a setting to Safari to disable this behavior. The desired behavior is that Safari does not treat Apple websites differently than other websites. When navigating to a log in page, Safari should show the standard username and password fields."
