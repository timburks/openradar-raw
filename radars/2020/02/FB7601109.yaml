    description: "If you access the presentationController property before setting the modalPresentationStyle, the style is ignored.\r\n\r\nThis code will result in a full screen modal presentation, as expected:\r\n   let viewController = UIViewController()\r\n   viewController.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen\r\n   _ = viewController.presentationController\r\n   present(viewController, animated: true)\r\n\r\nThis code will result in a page sheet modal presentation, which is not expected:\r\n   let viewController = UIViewController()\r\n   _ = viewController.presentationController\r\n   viewController.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen\r\n   present(viewController, animated: true)\r\n\r\nI would expect to be able to access the presentationController property at any point and it not to affect the modalPresentationStyle value. This resulted in a day of dev time lost to trying to figure out why the modal style was not being applied!\r\n\r\nI have attached a minimal project to display this behaviour. This was observed on Xcode 11.3.1, with iOS 13.3 simulator."
