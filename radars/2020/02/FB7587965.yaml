    description: "Though I haven’t dug into the reason, sysdiagnoses on my laptop are about 450-500MB. On my (upgraded, home, wireless) internet connection, this results in problem report submissions timing out just before the files finish uploading. If I retry several times, one of them tends to eventually make it through, but that’s a huge waste of bandwidth for everybody.\r\n\r\nGiven that this team probably doesn’t have control over sysdiagnose size, please consider a resumable upload implementation for large attachments."
