    description: "When an XCTestCase subclass overrides ‘name’, the new name isn’t used in either the Test Navigator in Xcode or in the log output. You have to override the undocumented `languageAgnosticTestMethodName` instead. (And that still doesn’t allow customizing the whole line for textual output; you have to also override `nameForLegacyLogging` in that case.)\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of this in the attached archive’s ExpectedOutputTests class (also at https://belkadan.com/source/ROSE-8/commit/6ba964352de647ceb0394a3d54e302a15f1e672f)."
