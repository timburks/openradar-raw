    description: "I have an NSTextView whose contents are populated programmatically. I do this by setting the NSTextView’s ‘string’ property, and letting it pick up its attributes from the ‘typingAttributes’ property. However, there’s no way to configure that from Interface Builder, leaving me to put in some dummy text and then do this workaround:\r\n\r\n\toutput.typingAttributes = output.textStorage!.attributes(at: 0, effectiveRange: nil)\r\n\toutput.string = \"\"\r\n\r\nAt least for a non-rich-text-supporting and/or non-editable NSTextView, configuring the font of an empty instance should result in setting the typing attributes, rather than simply being ignored as it is today."
