    description: "# Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Make a new empty project.\r\n2. Add https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift.git as a package dependency.\r\n3. Use Show in Finder to find the checkout that Xcode has made.\r\n4. Close the project.\r\n5. Open the xcodeproj inside the SQLite.swift checkout.\r\n\r\n# What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nOne dialog that the project is locked and that I canâ€™t make any changes.\r\n\r\n# What actually happened?\r\n\r\nEvery few seconds, I get a dialog about the workspace again. (See screenshot.)"
