    description: "SwiftUI previews for different localeIdentifiers don’t match what is expected, nor what is displayed on simulators and devices.\r\n\r\n1. Open and run attached sample project.\r\n2. Check text displayed in TextFields for localised text, across three languages, using two different Text field initializers; not what is expected.\r\n3. Run each scheme in project (one for each language) on simulator and/or device, and compare to SwiftUi previews. They don’t match.\r\n4. See comments in ContentView.swift for more details.\r\n\r\nSample Project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hvdqfu1UBIOM2DuR0xpb2IgYbfYk1923/view?usp=sharing"
