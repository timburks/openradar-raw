    description: "When a text field is the first responder in a sheet on an iPad in Portrait mode and the textfield changes to disabled, the app crashes.\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached example project.\r\n2. Run on an iPad/iPad Simulator (I tried this with the 12.9 inch 3rd gen)\r\n3. Make sure that the iPad is portrait mode\r\n4. Open the sheet by pressing \"Open Sheet\"\r\n5. Select the text field\r\n6. Make sure that the onscreen keyboard is shown\r\n7. Press the \"Disable Text Field\" button\r\n\r\nNow the application will crash."
