    description: "When a SwiftPM executable target has a different product name from its target name, Xcode will use the product name as the module name rather than the target name. This can be a problem if you have an executable target whose product name is the same as a library target’s module name, or differing only in case.\r\n\r\n(I’m not sure how it should behave for libraries. Arguably the library name doesn’t have to be the same as the module name either, as long as all the autolinking stuff is worked out.)"
