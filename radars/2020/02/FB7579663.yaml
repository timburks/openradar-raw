    description: "We have had it suggested to us by a very in-the-know testing service around accessibility behaviours in software, that the “Actions Available” message, to indicate that there are actions available by swiping up or down on a table view cell, should be read to the user every time they visit a given cell.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this is only read once for any individual table view, or perhaps once per re-use of a given cell class."
