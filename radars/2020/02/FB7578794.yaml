    description: "There needs to be a mode of Do Not Disturb that makes it where notifications will not display even if the device is being used. This is most important for the use-case of mirroring your display via AirPlay or presenting via the broadcast feature to an app like Zoom. There is no good, quick way to disable all notifications so that it doesn't show your personal messages while presenting.\r\n\r\nI expect either a mode of do not disturb that does this, or even just a global on/off switch for notifications as a whole."
