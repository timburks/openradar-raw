    description: "On all Macs I have checked, the folders created at ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Retired for each user account are not able to be read by the user account in whose Home it is located. This is an issue for some automated processes (including some Xcode simulator automation) which need to read contents of the user Home. Many processes expect to have at least some level of permissions on anything inside ~/ when run as a particular user.\r\n\r\nIf each instance of this folder must be owned by root for some reason, then there should be an ACE added for the user in whose Home it is created, or it should be relocated outside of the user Home."
