    description: "Our app provides a way for the user to log in using one of several identity providers, including Apple, thanks to the \"Sign in with Apple\" feature provided by the AuthenticationServices framework.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, and unlike the other identity providers, Apple currently does not expose an authorization scope that allows us to retrieve the user's picture or avatar.\r\n\r\nWe display the user avatar (when available) in the Profile page of our app, beside the user's full name. UI-wise, it's a nice colorful touch, and it's in line with what several other apps (including Apple apps) do on several platforms.\r\n\r\nPlease add a way to retrieve user avatars through the AuthenticationServices framework."
