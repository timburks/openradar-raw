    description: "- I instruct Siri to play a playlist while connected to a Bluetooth speaker (either my car or an external speaker, issue is reproducible either way).\r\n\r\n- The first song of the playlist plays at normal sound level.\r\n\r\n- The 2nd song starts playing at full sound level as if Sound Check was disabled (usually much louder than the first song).\r\n\r\n- After around 5-10 seconds, it decreases volume back to Sound Check level. From there on it continues playing at this level over all other songs to come.\r\n\r\nEvery time I connect to a Bluetooth device and start playing a playlist this issue is reproducible. The Sysdiagnose file was created shortly after the 2nd song played and the volume went back to normal level."
