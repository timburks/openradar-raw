    description: "UIKit offers much more control over the styling of list separators than SwiftUI does. While ListStyles offer some degree of control, one cannot generate custom ListStyles at the moment, limiting customisability to the first party styles.\r\n\r\nSome behaviour that currently cannot be implemented in SwiftUI:\r\n- The ability to hide separators\r\n- The ability to change separator colours\r\n- The ability to align the leading and trailing edges of separators to custom anchors/alignments"
