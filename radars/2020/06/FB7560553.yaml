    description: "This is regarding my thread on the Apple developer forums, found here:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/128357\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to have my Safari app extension change a tab’s (or page’s) user agent. I was attempting to create a Safari app extension equivalent of the Chrome and Firefox extension “GoodTwitter”. The objective is to set a particular cookie and change the user agent to force the Twitter website to use the old design.\r\n\r\nIn this case the user agent I would like to set is “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko”, so I would need a way to set an arbitrary value (i.e. functionality equivalent to the “Other…” option under the menu Develop > User Agent).\r\n\r\nEven if this use-case isn’t Mac App Store friendly due to its weak foundation (being dependent on technically deprecated Twitter behavior) it would still be nice to have the API access."
