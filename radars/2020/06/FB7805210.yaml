Open Xcode beta on a machine that has not previously used Xcode with a developer account\r\n2. Create a new project\r\n3. Choose \"Add team\" from the team selection dropdown\r\n4.

Open Xcode's Account preferences\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI should be able to manage my accounts within Xcode.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nXcode crashes whenever I open the Accounts pane."
