    description: "1. Create a `UIColorPickerViewController` and set its delegate.\r\n2. Open the color picker on an iPad.\r\n3. Tap outside the color picker's view.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n- The color picker is dismissed\r\n- The delegate receives a `colorPickerViewControllerDidFinish` message\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n- The color picker is dismissed\r\n- The delegate does not receive a `colorPickerViewControllerDidFinish` message\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nIt is useful to be able to update application state when the user has finished picking a color, even if the color change is being monitored via `colorPickerViewControllerDidSelectColor`. For example, we don't want to save a user's color selection hundreds of times as they drag their finger around the 'Spectrum' view, so we should wait until the user has finished with the color picker. But on iPad, the color picker can be dismissed without using the 'close' button by tapping out side its view. \r\n\r\nThe other interpretation is that a tap outside the view is considered a 'cancel'. This seems unlikely since the color picker offers no such cancel action on iPhone (or more precisely, when the horizontal size class is compact). And if this the intention, `colorPickerViewControllerDidCancel` should be provided."
