    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nWhen running the Build command in XCode Version 11.5 (11E608c) on https://github.com/spokestack/spokestack-ios/commit/264963dafbe039fe65e2a033db1d60285f6fb2ea, a \"Segmentation fault: 11\" occurs.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nWhen running the Build command in XCode on https://github.com/spokestack/spokestack-ios/commit/40f87f49076a0959c1f83d8a8054d5280a2a972a, the command completes successfully. \r\n\r\nThe difference between the Build command causing a segfault and completing successfully is a single \"throws\" in a protocol function implementation. See https://github.com/spokestack/spokestack-ios/commit/264963dafbe039fe65e2a033db1d60285f6fb2ea for the diff.\r\n\r\nI have attached the segfault stack dump and a zip of the project at https://github.com/spokestack/spokestack-ios/commit/264963dafbe039fe65e2a033db1d60285f6fb2ea that will segfault when the Build command is run.\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nWhen the Build command is run on the provided example project, I expected a \"Type 'AppleSpeechRecognizer' does not conform to protocol 'SpeechProcessor'\" error from the compiler.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nWhen the Build command is run on the provided example project, I receive a \"Segmentation fault: 11\" error from the compiler."
