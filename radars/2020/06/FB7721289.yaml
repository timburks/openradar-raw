    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nInterface builder displays image from framework but the image loading fails at runtime\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\nWhat version of Xcode are you using?\r\nXcode 11.5\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nWhen trying to load an asset from another framework, Interface Builder correctly displays the image in the image view. When ran on a device/simulator the image loading will fail. \r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated by loading the image from code using the appropriate bundle hint, however in that case setting images to image views from Interface Builder becomes useless. At the moment, being able to pick an image from a secondary bundle leads to false expectations.\r\n\r\nI think this could be solved by allowing the user to specify the module to load the image from (either via a \"BundleName/image\" syntax or by a dropdown), similar to how we load custom classes from other modules.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nCreate an iOS project, add a framework and add a Media.xcassets catalog to this framework. Add an asset to this catalog. Back in the main project open the storyboard and add an image view and assign the asset as the image for this image view. Run the application.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nThe icon should be displayed on the screen in the attached image view.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe image view remains blank and a warning is produced in the console: \r\nCould not load the \"xcode\" image referenced from a nib in the bundle with identifier \"com.example.ImageLoading\""
