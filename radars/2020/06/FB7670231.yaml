Please be as exact as possible.\r\nA. XXX XXX XXX Action(Open/Close) Garage Name(Dad garage's) Door Name(Front door)\r\n\r\nQ.What was Siriâ€™s response?\r\nA.In the iOS v13.4 (\"Ok opening, Door command sent successfully\"), v13.3.1 (\"Door command sent successfully\"), v12.4.4 (\"Door command sent successfully\")\r\n\r\nQ.What response did you expect from Siri?\r\nA.You can see here, in the iOS v13.4 adds \"Ok opening\" message automatically although door is opening or closing. So this extra message confuses to our customer while door closing. It shows : \"Ok opening, Door command sent successfully\"\r\n\r\nQ.Did this issue happen once, or does it happen every time?\r\nA.It happens every time in the iOS v13.4\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n\r\nProblem description\r\n==========================================\r\nWe are using Siri to open or close the garage doors. It works fine. Our customers are facing one issue in the iOS v13.4. It seems like in the v13.4 Siri adds one extra message on the response of the Siri shortcuts. I have tried in another iOS version 13.3.1, 12.4.4. It shows exactly what I want. But iOS v13.4 adds \"Ok opening\" extra message with my original message on the response of Siri. The problem is \"Ok opening\" shows every time although I am trying to open or close the door. So our customers are getting trouble while closing the door. Because Siri says, \"Ok opening, door command sent successfully\".\r\n\r\nFYI: \"door command sent successfully\" is our message and \"ok opening\" is the extra message. \r\n\r\nStep by step instruction to reproduce the problem\r\n==========================================\r\n- Please be sure you have iOS v13.4\r\n- Install the Tailwind app\r\n- Login with demo account credentials.\r\n- Hey Siri, \"Close garage door 1\"\r\n- You will see the output : \"Ok opening, Door command sent successfully\"\r\n- Output should be: \"Door command sent successfully\" only.\r\n\r\nWhat result you expected\r\n==========================================\r\n- \"Door command sent successfully\" only.\r\n\r\nWhat results you actually saw\r\n==========================================\r\n- \"Ok opening, Door command sent successfully\""
