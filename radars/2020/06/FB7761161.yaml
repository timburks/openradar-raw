    description: I’m using picture-in-picture support to watch WWDC sessions from the Developer app, but I’m multi-tasking while I do so. Occasionally I want to jump back to hear something I missed, which is something you can do in the Developer app and in QuickTime! But picture-in-picture doesn’t have that option, even though it has a play/pause control.
