    description: "# Please describe the issue:\r\nWhen updating the app information for an app version that has been already approved for external testing, the app information sent out to new testers will include the original app information that was present when the review happened. The documentation here (https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deva50a6ab41) says \"You can update this information anytime and testers will see the updates in the TestFlight app.\"\r\n\r\n# Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Create a new version and build number\r\n2. Fill in app information\r\n3. Submit for TestFlight external app review\r\n4. Send out build to one tester (let's name it A)\r\n5. Create a new build with same version but bumped build number\r\n6. Change app information to something else\r\n7. Send out build to another tester (let's name it B)\r\n\r\n# What did you expect to happen?\r\nUser A received the first version of the app information in the invite email.\r\nUser B received the updated version of the app information in the invite email\r\n\r\n# What actually happened?\r\nUser A received the first version of the app information in the invite email.\r\nUser B also received the first version of the app information in the invite email. \r\nMeaning the app information wasn't updated, even though the AppStoreConnect page shows the updated version.\r\n\r\nAttached screenshot of what's visible on AppStoreConnect and what's sent out to the user.\r\nThen changed the app information to something different, but still the original message is being sent out"
