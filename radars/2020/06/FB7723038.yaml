    description: "In Photos Version 5.0 (151.19.150) on macOS Catalina 10.15.5\r\nWhen I open a Shared Album\r\nand I right-click a video\r\nand I choose Import\r\nthen the video is imported to my photos library\r\nbut the video date is set to today\r\n\r\nI would expect that the original video date is maintained also in my Photos library.\r\n\r\nSee the attached screen recording for an example:\r\n- The original video was taken and published to the Shared Album using the iOS Camera/Photos app on 28. August 2019.\r\n- After importing to my Photos library, the video date displayed is today, 3. June 2020."
