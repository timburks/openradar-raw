    description: Users are already allowed to adjust the width of the code completion popover, and it would be advantageous to adjust the size vertically as well. There have been many instances lately where a method has more than eight overloads, and the limitation of the popover to eight lines makes it more difficult than necessary to compare the signatures all at once.
