    description: "PDFKit Checkbox Widget Annotations do not respect their isReadOnly flag\r\n\r\n- Create a PDFDocument instance with a PDF file that includes checkbox annotations\r\n- loop through the annotations on all pages, setting their isReadOnly flags to true\r\n- Save the PDFDocument to another file\r\n- Open the resulting PDF file in a PDFView (or the Files app)\r\n- Notice that the checkboxes can still be toggled by the user (but other types, such as text and choice widgets are not editable)\r\n- Open the same file with a PDF reader that does not use PDFView (eg: Google Chrome), and the checkboxes will not be editable)\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\nCheckboxes that are set read-only should not be modifiable in a PDFView."
