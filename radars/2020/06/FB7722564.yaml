When typing awakeFromNib (see attached screenshot) auto-complete shows 2 awakeFromNibs in the list. One provides:\r\n\r\noverride class func awakeFromNib() {\r\n\r\nand the other:\r\n\r\noverride func awakeFromNib() {\r\n\r\nAs you can see the first is a class method but there was no way to know that from the auto-complete list. It would be a nice improvement if we could see in the list if the method is a class method or an instance method. Perhaps the M icon could have a variation if it is a class method? How about small m for instance method and captial M for class method?\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ytutzrGl.png"
