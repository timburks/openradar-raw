    description: "Description:\r\nAfter unlocking a machine on 10.15+ using the personal recovery key, running the command ``sudo fdesetup usingrecoverykey `` will show ``true``. But after changing the recovery key and not rebooting running the same command will still return ``true`` even though the machine is no longer unlocked using the recovery key. On previous macOS versions that supported running ``sudo fdesetup usingrecoverykey`` after changing the recovery key it would return ``false``. The current behavior breaks any automation workflow that wants to rotate the recovery key after using it unlock the drive, as it will continue to return unreliable information.\r\n\r\nReproduction Steps:\r\n - Enable FileVault on a machine running 10.15 or 11.0 with the Personal Recovery option, through System Preferences is fine, take note of the recovery key. \r\n - Shutdown the machine.  \r\n - Type password wrong 3 times\r\n - Select option that appears to use recovery key\r\n - Use the recovery key to unlock the machine\r\n - Change the password, and arrive at the desktop\r\n - Open terminal.app and run ``sudo fdesetup usingrecoverykey``, it should return ``true``\r\n - Now change the recovery key using the following command ``sudo fdesetup changerecovery\r\n-personal`` and follow the prompts entering your username and password \r\n- You should be presented with a new recovery.\r\n- Now that youâ€™ve changed the recovery key run ``sudo fdesetup usingrecoverykey`` again. It should still return ``true`` when in fact it should now return ``false`` This is new behavior from previous versions of macOS that would return false after changing the key.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\n\r\nAfter rotation of the FileVault recovery key the command ``sudo fdesetup usingrecoverykey`` should return ``false``\r\n\r\nActual Behavior:\r\nThe above command still returns true, even though the disk is no longer unlocked using the old recovery key.\r\n\r\nImpact Numbers:\r\n  This behavior affects the 8000 machines we currently run automation on, and tens of thousands of other machines at various companies that try the same automation."
