    description: "In UIKit, developers can use the `isModalInPresentation` property on `UIViewController` to enforce a modal behavior and prevent users from dismissing the modal using the swipe down gesture. This is especially useful when the sheet cannot be dismissed in order to prevent data loss.\r\n\r\nHowever, in SwiftUI there is no such documented equivalent for sheets. This feedback suggests adding either a modifier or a parameter on `sheet` to replicate the behavior of `isModalInPresentation`, for example:\r\n\r\n`view.sheet(isPresented: $isPresented, isModal: true) { ... }` or `view.sheet(isPresented: $isPresented) { Text(\"Modal\").presentationType(.modal) }`\r\n\r\nThis would avoid using workarounds such as swizzling UIViewController or trying to manipulate the behavior of sheets using a UIViewControllerRepresentable."
