    description: "I've created a UIInputViewController subclass for a keyboard extension. According to the documentation, the textDocumentProxy.selectedText property should contain \"The currently selected text in the document.\" However, in many cases, the selectedText property doesn't match what the user has selected in the UI.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n-  type the following text into a notes field in the contacts app: \"This is text0. This is text1. This is text2. This is text3. This is text4. This is text5. This is text6. This is text7. 1234567890bcdefghijklmnop\"\r\n- select the entire text\r\n- read the contents of textDocumentsProxy.selectedText from the UIInputViewController of a keyboard extension\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n- the textDocumentProxy.selectedText property contains: \"This is text0. This is text7. 1234567890bcdefghijklmnop\"\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n- the textDocumentProxy.selectedText property contains the entire text:  \"This is text0. This is text1. This is text2. This is text3. This is text4. This is text5. This is text6. This is text7. 1234567890bcdefghijklmnop\"\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible on both iOS 13, and the first iOS 14 beta. It reproduces on simulators and iPhone hardware.\r\n\r\nBecause of this truncation, I can't reliably provide functionality such as adding quote marks to selected text."
