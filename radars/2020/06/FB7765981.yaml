    description: "Set your wallpaper to the built-in Catalina Day wallpaper. The menu bar becomes progressively harder to “read” as you move toward the right side of the screen. I have a mild visual impairment and it’s very difficult for me to read the date and time.\r\n\r\nNon-solutions:\r\n1. using a different wallpaper,\r\n2. turning on reduced transparency (no other transparency causes me issues)"
