    description: "I’d expect to be able to duplicate a file in the Project Navigator—whether in a Group or Folder Reference. Within a Folder Reference, this is pretty easy (it should do whatever Duplicate in Finder does), but within a Group there’s a question of target membership and such. A way to sidestep these questions, and make it obvious that this is a new file, is to show the Add File dialog once the file is duplicated, with the original’s targets pre-selected.\r\n\r\nDuplicating Groups sounds a little more difficult, but that could be left for later."
