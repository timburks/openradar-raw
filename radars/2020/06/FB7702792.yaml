It has a 1080p BenQ display attached to its HDMI port and a Samsung U28E590 4K display attached to the frontmost left Thunderbolt 2 port via a MiniDP-to-DisplayPort cable. The 4K display is designated as the main display.\r\n\r\nThe MacBook is permanently set up on my desk, the screens are permanently plugged in. When I turn on all 3 devices (in the same order every morning), it is random which display will be considered \"Display 2\" or \"Display 3\" (the 4K display is always Display 1, being the main screen).\r\n\r\nGiven I have certain applications assigned to particular displays, this means my windows constantly end up moved and resized to fit on the wrong screen.\r\n\r\nCan you please fix this?\r\n\r\nFor my particular use case, it would already help if displays apart from the main screen were sorted by model name or pixel dimensions, or by the name of whatever port they are attached to. \r\n\r\nThank you."
