    description: "I have a table view cell that shows an unread badge/symbol.  If the `unread` value changes on the server, the new value is pushed to me and I hide the view.\r\n\r\nI am using `UITableViewDiffableDataSource` and applying a `NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot` with the `reloadItems(_:)` method.\r\n\r\n```func configure(with foo: Foo) {\r\n  unreadView.isHidden = foo.unread\r\n  accessbilityUnreadLabel.isHidden = foo.unread\r\n}```\r\nFor whatever reason when the `configure(with:)` method is called it seems like it is still using the old object, instead of what I applied because `foo.unread` is still representing the old value, rather than using the value from the updated item. When the cell recycles due to scrolling and when it prepares to appear again `foo.unread` is now the correct value.\r\n\r\n*Expected Behavior*\r\nI would expect the applied snapshot to result in my `cellProvider` callback to receive the new item, instead of a stale/apparently old version.\x03\x03"
