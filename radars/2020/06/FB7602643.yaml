    description: "When installing a custom B2B app via the family purchase feature, app updates are not displayed nor downloaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a privately available B2B app\r\n2. User A (Apple ID A) downloads the app via a redemption code\r\n3. User B (Apple ID B) is a family together with User A\r\n4. User B downloads the B2B app, too, via the family purchases list\r\n5. The B2B app receives an update\r\n\r\n6. User A sees this update and can download it\r\n7. BUG: User B never sees the update and canâ€™t download it - the new version is only downloaded after deleting and re-downloading the B2B app."
