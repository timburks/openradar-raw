    description: "Bindings are not working through navigation stack, when data is bound between State in a root view and a Binding in pushed view. The bug has been confirmed in SwiftUI labs. Attached is a SwiftUI view that showcases the issue. Two bugs happen there:\r\n\r\n1. Expected behavior: After tapping “push next” and interacting with Stepper, value should change in the label above. Actual behavior: text above the stepper in pushed view is not being updated to reflect changes.\r\n\r\n2. Expected behavior: After tapping “push next” and interacting with Stepper, value in root (previous) view should be updated. Actual behavior: when interacting with stepper multiple times in quick succession, it doesn’t properly change the value in root (previous) view, as if the user input was throttled. This doesn’t happen in the root view itself, which uses the same component in the same configuration."
