    description: "Currently the `UIKeyboardLayoutStar` private class has a `_currentHandBias` property  that determines if the user shifted their keyboard either to the left or to the right.\r\n\r\nMaking this information consumable for developers would make it easier to accommodate to the user's preferences in the UI."
