    description: "For some files, compression_stream_process will fail if the destination buffer is larger. It succeeds if the destination buffer is 32kb but it will fail if the destination buffer is 512kb.\r\n\r\nThis seems specific to the file that is being decompressed. My sample project includes files which can reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nI've attached a project that reproduces the issue very easily. https://www.dropbox.com/s/z58fqyuec1ce7i8/CompressionBug.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\nThank you for your help! I've been using the Compression framework for years and this is the first issue I've run into. A customer reported that some of their files couldn't be opened. It turns out this bug is specific to their files for some reason."
