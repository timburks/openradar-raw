    description: "When the keyboard disappears, `keyboardWillHideNotification` should always be fired. With the new iOS 14.2 beta, this is not always the case.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n- Have a UIViewController that can become first responder (with a custom view)\r\n- Add a UITextView as a subview of this view controller, and put the focus in it\r\n- Call `resignFirstResponder()` on this text view\r\n- The keyboard will disappear and the view controller will then become first responder\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n`keyboardWillHideNotification` should be fired.\r\n\r\nObserved result:\r\n`keyboardWillHideNotification` is not fired, even though the keyboard disappeared."
