    description: "**Details**\r\n\r\n- Are you missing Health data? (You can view Activity Health data in Health app > Browse > Activity > (Type) > Show All Data)\r\nYes\r\n\r\n- Please describe the missing data including the source (Fitness app, third party app, manual entry, restore from backup) of that data if known.\r\n\r\nFitness app recording on watchOS of run, cycling, etc. end up without GPS samples in Health when viewed on iOS.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\n**Please describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:**\r\n\r\nMany of our users (and publications) are reporting missing route (GPS) samples from the workout that’s added/viewed in Health on iOS. These workouts are being recorded on watchOS 7 in the Fitness app and then later viewed on iOS 14. This results in our application mistakenly being blamed for GPS samples that aren’t available to us nor the user.\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix for this problem (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211865) is difficult for us to convince the 10-100s of people who are writing into our Support channels to do."
