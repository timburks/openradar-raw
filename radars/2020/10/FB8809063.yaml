    description: "Context: Catalina on an Intel Mac.\r\n\r\nThe fallout from this can be seen by looking at this Carthage bug: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/3019\r\n\r\nWorkarounds (until Carthage itself is updated) include using a wrapper script to exclude the arm64 architecture from simulator builds. But this only fixes the dependencies. The main project must also be updated to EXCLUDE_ARCHS=arm64 for simulator builds, because by default, Xcode will attempt to build for arm64 when doing a simulator build, even though there's no way to run arm64 Simulator on an Intel Mac. Xcode should be smart enough to know this, and not include arm64 in the default build if it's not explicitly excluded. It wastes time and disk space and ultimately fails."
