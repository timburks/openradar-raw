    description: "Core Data batch insert returns error when batch inserting an entity with unique constraint on multiple attributes.\r\n\r\nI have a sample code illustrating the problem:\r\nhttps://github.com/billibala/BatchInsertAndUniqueConstraints\r\n\r\nI expect the insert to goes through. \r\n\r\nMy work around of this problem is... create an extra attribute to store the compound key there instead. Obviously this is more error prone. But it's a workaround.\r\n\r\nI hope Core Data team can update the documentation or the, better, fix the issue.\r\n\r\nThe documentation does says we can use coma-separated list in unique constraint. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/loading_and_displaying_a_large_data_feed"
