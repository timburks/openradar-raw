    description: "Animated transition between elements laid out in HStack and VStack is incorrect. Consider the following view body:\r\n\r\nif isHorizontal {\r\n    HStack {\r\n        Text(\"Hello,\").id(1)\r\n        Text(\"World!\").id(2)\r\n    }\r\n} else {\r\n    VStack {\r\n        Text(\"Hello,\").id(1)\r\n        Text(\"World!\").id(2)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: when isHorizontal state variable changes, “Hello,” and “World!” animate between their positions in vertical and horizontal stack. Actual behaviour: there is a weird cross-fade transition. Attached is a sample SwiftUI view that showcases the issue."
