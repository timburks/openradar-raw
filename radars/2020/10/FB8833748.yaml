    description: "LocalAuthentication supports LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithWatch and LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometricsOrWatchis on macOS.\r\n\r\nOn iOS this isn't available but it would really add practical value as Face ID is often unavailable when wearing masks for covid19 protection\r\n\r\nPlease make it a priority to bring these policies to iOS as mask wearing will be with us for a while."
