    description: "I was seeing an error when trying to export a video from a shared album. The error message was \"The operation could not be completed. An unknown error occurred (-17507)\", and the NSError returned did not have any suggestions on how to fix the issue. The preset was AVAssetExportPresetPassthrough and the file output type was MOV.\r\n\r\nI do not know why this asset did not work, but I was able to use this code with the same asset in iOS 13 without issues, so I suspect this is iOS 14 specific.\r\n\r\nI generated the sysdiagnose, and the error occurred around October 20th, 2020, 4:15PM EST."
