    description: "I am trying to use the new iOS 13 class, UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout but am not able to get meaning information from the NSCollectionLayoutSection.visibleItemsInvalidationHandler. In the simple example (see code, see movie file) I keep getting output like the following when I swipe to the next cell. I do not know why cell 0:0 shows up constantly even though I am toward the middle or end of my cells in the collection view.\r\n\r\nitem: 0:0\r\nitem: 2:0\r\nitem: 3:0\r\n \r\nitem: 0:0\r\nitem: 3:0\r\n \r\nBackground: My collectionView is setup such that a cell takes the entire screen. As the user swipes through the cells I need to know the \"current\" visible cell. However, since cell 0:0 always shows up in the array of visible items I cannot do what I need to do. Ultimately, I am trying to workaround an issue where when the user rotates the device the scrolling is incorrect and I see half of two separate cells - which is wrong since I am paging."
