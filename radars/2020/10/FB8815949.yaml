Move mouse to console area and expand the console size by pulling up\r\n\r\n5. The maximum size of console area will be about 2/3 of screen, can't get bigger\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\n- Console area should be able to fully expand as same as the screen size, it works on Xcode 11 and below\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n- The console area only expands to 2/3 of screen, causing hard to read output messages \r\n\r\nDemo video: https://i.imgur.com/baVLReH.mp4"
