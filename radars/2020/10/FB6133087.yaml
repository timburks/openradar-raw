    description: "SwiftUI currently provides the following types to set horizontal and vertical alignment where applicable: HAlignment, HorizontalAlignment; VAlignment, VerticalAlignment. Some APIs use one, some another despite the fact that they have identical set of possible values.\r\n\r\nSwiftUI should only provide one type for describing alignment across an axis."
