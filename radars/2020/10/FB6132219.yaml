    description: "The highest arity of ViewBuilder.buildBlock() is 10, which prevents from building views with more than 10 direct children. While it is possible to work around this using Groups and other containers, inability to have more than 10 direct children is a serious limitation in more complex view hierarchies.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample SwiftUI view that showcases the issue. Expected behavior: The code compiles and shows 6 labels divided by 5 dividers. Actual behavior: the code doesnâ€™t compile. Comment out the last line (11th child) and the code compiles again."
