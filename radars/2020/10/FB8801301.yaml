    description: "Basic Information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nBluetooth audio fails after connecting iPhone via USB port\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nBluetooth\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\nWhat does the Bluetooth issue you are seeing involve?\r\nSomething else not on this list\r\n\r\nWhat kind of device were you trying to use?\r\nHeadphones / speakers\r\n\r\nWhat is the make / model of the device?\r\nMultiple, for example Apple AirPods and JBL Flip 5\r\n\r\nHas the device ever been paired with a different computer before?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nDo you have any third party Bluetooth software installed?\r\nI don't know\r\n\r\nDo you use any other Bluetooth devices with your Mac?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when this last occurred? (Example: 12:00 pm EST 02/14/2018)\r\n10/14/2020\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\n\r\nThis is an issue that is present for at least 5 years in macOS. \r\nHowever, I decided to open a radar now that I could reproduce it (somewhat consistently). \r\nFor full context, please read this post of mine here: https://gist.github.com/nicolasembleton/afc19940da26716f8e90#gistcomment-3422499\r\n\r\nThe issue is that bluetooth audio (e.g. my Apple AirPods) starts failing \"randomly\" (more on this later), and once it does, only a bluetooth/audio daemon restart fixes it (or a mac reboot). Interestingly, a daemon restart is not always possible - not sure why - so I have to do it at least a couple times until my macOS menu bar audio icon grays out (so I know it's actually restarting). I haven't figured out the reason for this yet.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- With AirPods paired and playing music, connect an iPhone to the USB-C port.\r\n\r\nWhat happens:\r\n- Audio will either go silent, or start transmitting lots of noise (cut off music, on/off stream).\r\n\r\nWhat was expected to happen:\r\n- The audio shouldn't fail at all.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not the only way to reproduce this issue, but it's ONE way that I was able to somewhat consistently reproduce it. \r\nIf you read the thread I linked above, you'll see this has been happening for at least 5 years, and multiple users see different behaviors/fixes, but the issue is there. \r\nThis is by far the #1 problem with macOS in my opinion. It has been happening TO ME for over one year, and I've even bought new AirPods, but no luck. I have yet to buy a new macbook to see if this still happens."
