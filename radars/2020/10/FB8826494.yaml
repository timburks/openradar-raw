    description: "The crash occurs when Text (initialized with Date) is a child of a ScrollView. Note it doesnâ€™t seem to matter how deeply nested Text is within the ScrollView. Got the same crash with 5 levels of HStack between the ScrollView and Text. See attached \"bt_all_output.txt\" for backtrace when the crash occured.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the crash with Xcode 12.0.1 (12A7300) as well as Xcode 12.2 beta 3 (12B5035g) on an 11 inch iPad Pro, iOS 14.0.1 device as well as simulator.\r\n\r\nCode below is the simplest way to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport SwiftUI\r\n\r\n@main\r\nstruct DateTextCrashApp: App {\r\n    var body: some Scene {\r\n        WindowGroup {\r\n            ScrollView {\r\n                Text( Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 20), style: .relative )\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```"
