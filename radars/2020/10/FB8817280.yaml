    description: "Using the Text View with string interpolation and a formatter has a bug when supplying a MeasurementFormatter. If I configure a MeasurementFormatter's numberFormatter, when I pass as the formatter param to a Text view, if I change a locale setting, e.g. the Temperature format in the Settings app, then my measurement formatter loses its number formatting.  I've attached a sample project that demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\n 1. Launch application in iPhone SE Simulator.\r\n 2. The number is output with 6 fractional digits as the formatter specified.\r\n 3. Keep app running, go to homescreen, open Settings app, General, Language & Region, Temperature Unit, change it from C to F or vice versa.\r\n 4. Switch back to the running app.\r\n \r\n What expect to happen:\r\n Number should still be 6 decimals.\r\n \r\n What actually happens:\r\n Number is shown with only 3 decimals.\r\n\r\nAdditional info\r\nI've tested the behaviour of the MeasurementFormatter in ObjC and Swift apps and I have only experienced the problem in SwiftUI. Also in SwiftUI if I do not pass the formatter into a Text then the issue does not happen, e.g. Text(degreesFormatter.string(from:degrees))"
