    description: "There is no way to make ScrollView fill its content either on vertical or horizontal axis. The equivalent of this behaviour in UIKit would be using NSLayoutConstraints to constrain width of the content view to the width of the scroll view’s content layout guide.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample SwiftUI view that showcases the issue. Expected bahaviour: green background is full-width, touches both left and right edge of the ScrollView. Actual behaviour: it doesn’t.\r\n\r\nUsing Xcode 11 Beta 1."
