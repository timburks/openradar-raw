    description: "Basic information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nInaccurate documentation for UICollectionViewCell\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\nPlease provide the URL of the content you reporting an issue with:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionreusableview/1620141-prepareforreuse?changes=_9&language=objc\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nThe documentation says that the default implementation of the `prepareForReuse` method does nothing. However, the stack trace in the attached image shows that `-[UIView(Animation) _removeAllAnimations:]` was being called from `-[UICollectionViewCell prepareForReuse]`.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Created a collection view\r\n2. Created a cell and overrode the layer class\r\n3. Overrode the `removeAllAnimations` method on the layer class\r\n4. Breakpoint in `removeAllAnimations`\r\n5. Add `CABasicAnimation` with large repeat count to cell\r\n6. Call `reloadData` on the collection view\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI added some animation to the collection view cell. The documentation describes that the default implementation of `-[UICollectionViewCell prepareForReuse]` should do nothing, so I expected the animation in the collection view cell to persist after reloading was complete.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThe animation in the collection view cell abruptly stopped after the data was reloaded. It took a while to figure out the root cause since the documentation does not mention that any existing animations will stop after `-[UICollectionView reloadData]` or `-[UICollectionViewCell prepareForReuse]` are called."
