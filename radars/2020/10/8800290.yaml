    description: "dtrace output for some programs is intermittently producing lines with invalid encoding, rendering it unusable for downstream tooling.\r\n\r\nThe encoding is definitely not valid utf-8, but doesn't seem to be any particular encoding. The fact that it seems to happen only on long lines makes me wonder if there's some kind of buffer overflow/overwrite happening. \r\n\r\nFor more context, I believe this dtrace bug is the root cause of this downstream issue: https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph/issues/32\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nsudo dtrace -x \"ustackframes=100\" -n \"profile-997 /pid == $target/ {{ @[ustack(100)] = count(); }}\" -o \"my_output.stacks my-app-binary\r\n\r\nAfter profiling for a while (30s?) and exiting dtrace, my_output.stack sometimes contains invalid utf8 about 1/3 of the time.\r\n\r\n## What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nOnly valid utf-8 should be output by dtrace\r\n\r\n## What actually happened?\r\n\r\ndtrace output contains some invalid lines"
