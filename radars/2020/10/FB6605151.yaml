    description: "I have a simple app, where I have compositional layout with nested groups, to achieve cells of different size. \r\nOn each cell, I want to have the same kind of badge.\r\n\r\nWhen specifying the same kind of supplementary item kind for items in nested groups (within the same section), an exception is thrown that there are duplicate supplementary items. \r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: different items can have the same kind of supplementary item, because they would correspond to the same kind of cells within a section."
