    description: "1. Launch Contacts.\r\n2. Select a contact that has a birthday.\r\n3. Right click the birthday and select \"Show This Date in Calendar\".\r\n\r\nWhat expect to happen:\r\nCalendar should launch and show this date.\r\n\r\nWhat happens:\r\nCalendar launches but does not show the date.  Console reports: \r\nSince sending application [sess=100003 pid=1155 uid:501,501,501 g:20,20 pV:2949] is not permitted to send this AppleEvent to this process, returning an errAEEventNotPermitted reply.\r\n\r\nI noticed this on 10.15.6 (19G2021) but I had my friend test on Big Sur Beta 9 and is has the same problem."
