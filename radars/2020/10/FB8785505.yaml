    description: "I have an app that uses AVCaptureSession to show preview from camera and capture photos. AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer is used for preview.\r\nThe issue I’m seeing happens on iOS 14 only, and only on iPhone 11 Pro. Not reproducible on XS. Happens both if built with Xcode 11.6 or 12.\r\n\r\nSometimes, device enters such state that preview from camera are black. \r\nIf I log preview layers state when this occurs, it has following state:\r\nlayer.isPreviewing - false\r\nlayer.session.isRunning - true\r\nlayer.session.isInterrupted - false\r\nlayer.connection.isEnabled - true\r\nlayer.connection.isActive - true\r\n\r\nThis affects all apps that use similar stack at once. The season is running and preview is black. Sometimes taking a photo fixes it and previews start coming through.\r\n\r\nThis happens on Apples own AVCam example project too, if one small setting is changed.\r\n\r\nChanging photoOutput.isLivePhotoCaptureEnabled to false makes the AVCam app become affected too. \r\nAny session with such output gets black preview. Another session with photo output with isLivePhotoCaptureEnabled true is not affected and shows preview as expected.\r\n\r\nMany other apps are affected as well, for example Vivino. They observe isPreviewing property on the layer, which never becomes true, so they show placeholder forever.\r\n\r\nIt’s not always that device is in such state. Sometimes everything is as normal and previews show up as expected.\r\nBut sometimes, the previews don’t work for hours straight, and even restarting the phone does not help. \r\n\r\nWe got customer reports that they cannot use camera in our app after updating to iOS 14. But next day they could use it again. On our own testing, I got the preview blackness on few days for many hours in a row (I was able to investigate and find out that setting isLivePhotoCaptureEnabled to yes “fixes” it). But some days I was not able to get the issue again.\r\n\r\nIn sysdiagnose, last it happened was October 6 around 8-9 am gmt.\r\n\r\nAttaching example project which is the same as AVCam sample with one line change."
