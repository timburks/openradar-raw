    description: "Regardless of the settings I use regarding architecture, I am unable to archive the application for submission to the App Store. This app uses a Swift package which depends on another Swift package with a binary dependency. That binary dependency is built only for x86 and not Apple silicon. \r\n\r\nDuring archiving, it continually builds the Swift packages in both x86 and arm64 architecture, regardless of build settings. When it tries to reference the binary dependency which is in x86, it fails in the `import` reference.\r\n\r\nThe application builds and runs fine however I unable to submit to the App Store.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nOpen Xcode Project from Github here:\r\nhttps://github.com/brightdigit/Speculid/releases/tag/3.0.0-alpha.2-wip\r\n\r\nArchive application"
