    description: "Setup: \r\niPhone X running iOS 14 Beta 3 and iMac running macOS 10.15.5 with Messages in iCloud enabled. \r\n\r\nCurrent behavior:\r\nRunning an SMS filter app on the iPhone X called VeroSMS (you can try with any other as well), the SMS are getting filtered successfully on iPhone X and are sent to the SMS Junk category without raising any alert. \r\n\r\nHowever, that SMS still shows up as an alert on connected devices such as Apple Watch or macOS via Messages in iCloud feature.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nWhen an SMS is marked as spam/junk on 1 device, Messages in iCloud should sync that metadata and prevent other devices from getting an alert. Otherwise the entire purpose of SMS Filtering API become moot.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI do not have a sysdiagnose attached as I have long turned off Messages in iCloud. Replicating it is pretty straight forward. If you aren't able to replicate and *really* need a sysdiagnose let me know."
