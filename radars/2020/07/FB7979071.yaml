    description: "App Store should allow developers to submit static SwiftUI views (à la WidgetKit) instead of screenshots. These \"screenshots\"—when viewed by a user—would reflect their device type, locale, color scheme, and even accessibility settings.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n1) Users can better understand whether an app will work well on their device/locale/accessibility accommodations, before purchasing.\r\n2) Developers don't need to manually generate screenshots for each device type, with each app update.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n* Apple introduces a new AdapativeScreenshot extension type, and developers implement this extension by adding their views to this target.\r\n* Developers generate SwiftUI view archives for each app screenshot. Apple allows developers to either generate these from view previews or by \"screenshotting\" a view on their device.\r\n* Developers submit SwiftUI view archives to App Store Connect with their app, which encodes all the information needed to render the view.\r\n* When a user browses the App Store, their device downloads the AdaptiveScreenshot extension and uses this to render the views. Alternatively, Apple pre-renders the views for each configuration.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nFYI, I posted this idea to Twitter, and it was very popular, and I was told to submit feedback.\r\nhttps://twitter.com/JadenGeller/status/1282510611176292352"
