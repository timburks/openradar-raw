    description: "When using StoreKit testing in Xcode 12.0 beta 2 (12A6163b) we see intermittent SKErrorUnknown errors for SKProductsRequest on autorenewing subscriptions. We see them both when interactively testing by selecting the .storekit in the schema as well as when running tests via SKTestSession. \r\n\r\nSometimes, restarting Xcode, the Simulator or the device addresses the issue, sometimes not. In any case, reliable testing isnâ€™t possible."
