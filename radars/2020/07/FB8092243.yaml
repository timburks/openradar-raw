    description: "The “defaults write com.apple.appleseed.FeedbackAssistant Autogather -bool NO” command makes things so much better for my Mac - automatically gathering files while I’m trying to work slows things down and uploading large datasets with my limited bandwidth takes a lot of time. It’s disruptive to my work.\r\n\r\nAlso, many of my reports are enhancement requests which do not need these large files.\r\n\r\nI can understand why you’ve chosen this as a default, but please expose this functionality in Preferences. At the very least, document it somewhere other than in the app’s string constants."
