    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\n\r\nThe CTL_HW_NAMES struct array macro defined in sysctl.h for the iOS 14.0 simulator has a typo-- there is no comma separating the third-to-last and second-to-last structs in the array.  This leads to any code referencing CTL_HW_NAMES failing to build for the simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\nIn an iOS project objective c file, `#import <sys/sysctl.h>`.  Then try to reference the macro in some line of code, such as `struct ctlname ctlnames[] = CTL_HW_NAMES;`.  Now try to build the project for the iOS 14 simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI expected the project to build without errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n\r\nThe project failed to build with these errors:\r\n\r\n<source file>: error: expected '}'\r\n            struct ctlname ctlnames[] = CTL_HW_NAMES;\r\n                                        ^\r\nIn module 'Darwin' imported from <source file>:\r\n/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator14.0.sdk/usr/include/sys/sysctl.h:612:2: note: expanded from macro 'CTL_HW_NAMES'\r\n        { \"target\", CTLTYPE_STRING }, \\\r\n        ^\r\n<source file>: note: to match this '{'\r\nIn module 'Darwin' imported from <source file>:\r\n/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator14.0.sdk/usr/include/sys/sysctl.h:585:22: note: expanded from macro 'CTL_HW_NAMES'\r\n#define CTL_HW_NAMES { \\\r\n                     ^"
