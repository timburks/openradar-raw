    description: "In Xcode 11 and earlier, up through Xcode 11.6, when the scheme management sheet is open for a workspace or project, it is possible to drag the schemes within the list to reorder them visually, both in the sheet and wherever the scheme selection dropdown appears.\r\n\r\nAs of Xcode 12 beta 1, and continuing through the current newest beta (12 beta 3), this functionality has been lost. Attempting to drag schemes in the management sheet gives GUI feedback as if a drag-and-drop is taking place, but once the drag is finished the scheme remains in its original position, and usually the current *selection* (i.e. the scheme with a focus highlight in the list) has changed instead. The drag does not take effect visibly or invisibly.\r\n\r\nIf I return to Xcode 11 and reorder the schemes, and then reopen the same workspace in Xcode 12, the new order remains intact.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely annoying - being able to reorder schemes in a large and complex workspace is often critical to an efficient workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new workspace in Xcode 11. Add a few Swift packages or projects to it, or otherwise generate at least three or four schemes.\r\n\r\n2. Select the Product -> Scheme -> Manage Schemes menu command (or otherwise evoke the scheme management UI by whatever means is preferred). Observe that it is possible to drag the schemes, and that the ordering defined by such dragging persists and affects all relevant GUI. Close the workspace.\r\n\r\n3. In Xcode 12, open the same workspace. Select Manage Schemes again, and attempt to click and drag the schemes as in Xcode 11 before. Observe that there is no visual or functional effect whatsoever on the scheme ordering, and that the feedback the GUI provides for the drag is misleading; it appears as though completing the drag action incorrectly registers as both cancelling the drag *and* as a single click on the GUI at the point at which the drag should have concluded."
