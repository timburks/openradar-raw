    description: I have a workspace that contains projects from multiple folders with separate git repositories. I modified files in one project, then went to Source Control > Discard All Changes…. The sheet asked me which repositories to discard changes for, which gave me a momentary fright that I had accidentally modified the files in the other repositories as well. But no, the sheet just didn’t check first. It would be better if it didn’t show those repositories at all, or showed them greyed out with an explanation, just as if there are /no/ changes the sheet won’t come up.
