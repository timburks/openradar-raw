    description: "Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. On a fresh macOS Big Sur installation with default shell settings, open Terminal.app\r\n2. Create a new folder with a German umlaut in its name by typing „mkdir Motörhead“\r\n3. Change into Motörhead using the „cd“ command.\r\n4. Notice that you indeed have changed into Motörhead and are ready to rock \\m/ but the window title is suggesting otherwise: sadly, it is cut off after the first umlaut.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression. Changing into Motörhead used to work in former macOS versions."
