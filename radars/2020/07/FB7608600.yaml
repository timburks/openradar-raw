    description: "AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey is supposed to only pre-scan the audio file for precise duration and seeking.\r\n\r\nIn case of FLAC files however a significant and unexpected audio quality degradation occurs when this flag is set.\r\n\r\nWith Core Audio it is currently not possible to both have precise duration and timing and play FLAC files in pristine quality.\r\n\r\nAttached a sample project for testing to easily open and play FLAC files and toggle AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey.\r\n\r\nListen closely how the stereo image falls apart when choosing a FLAC file with AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey set.\r\n\r\nXcode project attached to this report. Sample FLAC files for your convenience:\r\n[url removed from OpenRadar]\r\n\r\nThank you for looking into this issue. It would be extremely painful to rely on 3rd-party FLAC libraries only for this reason if FLAC support is already in the framework."
