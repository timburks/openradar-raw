    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nAfter creating a swift package that includes resources, I needed to generate an xcodeproj file to open the project in Xcode and add custom build phases or use Xcode's code coverage for my CI.\r\nBut after running the command \"swift package generate-xcodeproj\" and opening my project it doesn't compile because it can't find the \"Bundle.module\" that is compiled with the Swift Package Manager.\r\n\r\nI don't see any mentions about opening a swift package that includes resources with Xcode in the documentation so I'm not sure if this is a bug.. is it expected to open a swift package that includes resources with a xcodeproj?\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Create a new swift package\r\n2. Add resources to that package and use them using Bundle.module\r\n3. Open terminal and go to the module folder\r\n4. Run the command `swift package generate-xcodeproj`\r\n5. Open the project using the `xcodeproj` file\r\n6. Compile the package\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expect Xcode to compile correctly and generate the `Bundle.module` that is created by Swift Package Manager.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nXcode fails to compile because with the error: Type 'Bundle' has no member 'module' and I'm not able to use `Bundle.module` anywhere with my xcodeproj file."
