    description: "When debugging a mixed Obj-C/Swift project, the debugger doesn't work for Swift code. At the first time, Xcode prints \r\n\r\nCannot create Swift scratch context (couldn't load the Swift stdlib)\r\n\r\nin the LLDB console. I've put \"log enable lldb types -f /tmp/types.log\" into ~/.lldbinit as suggested here:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/651375\r\n\r\nAttached, you'll find the types.log."
