    description: "On iOS 13.5.1 on iPhone SE\r\nWhen I open a Shared Album\r\nand I tap a video\r\nand I open the “Sharing” menu by tapping the icon in the bottom-left corner\r\nand I choose to include all photos data in the sharing options\r\nand I tap “Save video”\r\nthen the video is saved to my device\r\nbut the video date/time is set to today/now.\r\n\r\nI would expect that the original video date is maintained also on my device.\r\n\r\nSee also the attached screen recording:\r\n- the video was taken and shared on August 28, 2019 using the iOS Camera app.\r\n- after importing the video to my iPhone, its date is set to today (July 7, 2020)"
