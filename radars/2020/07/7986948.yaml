    description: "Executing a PATCH to appStoreVersionLocalizations followed by a PATCH to appStoreVersion to modify releaseType results in an error saying “Invalid State” and “The attribute 'releaseType' can not be modified.” \r\n\r\nHowever, ‘releaseType’ can be modified but after unknown amount of time after the PATCH to appStoreVersionLocalizations.\r\n\r\nIt appears that PATCH to appStoreVersion needs to happen before a PATCH to appStoreVersionLocalization as some sort of processing is needed after a PATCH to appStoreVersionLocalization.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this behavior was fixed, documented, or a more descriptive error can be returned saying why ‘releaseType’ couldn’t me modified :)\r\n\r\n——\r\n\r\nOur solution was to move the PATCH to appStoreVersion before the PATCH to appStoreVersionLocalization. \r\n\r\nJust reporting this as the behavior we experienced was unexpected\r\n\r\n——\r\n\r\nGitHub issue in fastlane: https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/16679\r\nGitHub solution/PR in fastlane: https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/16843"

    title: Updating appStoreVersionLocalizations will put appStoreVersion in an “invalid state” which will prevent appStoreVersion from being updated
