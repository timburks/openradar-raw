    description: "While watching WWDC 2020 session 10649, \"Add custom views and modifiers to the Xcode Library,\" it occurred to me that it would be nice if other, non-Swift languages supported by Xcode could add content to the IDE's Library using either:  \r\n\r\n - An API that's either a direct port of or is similar to Swift's `LibraryContentProvider` protocol.  (This should be a good fit for Objective-C/Objective-C++, as those languages have protocols.  \r\n - Some other API akin and functionally equivalent to it.  (For plain C and C++, which don't support protocols.)"
