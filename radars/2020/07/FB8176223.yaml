    description: "When embedding a SwiftUI view into UIKit, there is no way to disable SafeArea behaviour. \r\n\r\nThis is important within UITableView/UICollectionView... sometimes when a SwiftUI UIHostingController is added to the hierarchy, it happens to be at the boundary of a safeArea in screen bounds and so applies dodging/expanding behaviour depending on the `edgesIgnoringSafeArea` modifier, even though within a scrollView this doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nThere is a `disableSafeArea` bool on UIHostingView, however this is private. The .edgesIgnoringSafeArea modifier does not achieve this purpose as it will extend the frame if enabled / dodge the safe area if set to `[]`\r\n\r\nIs there a way to achieve this?"
