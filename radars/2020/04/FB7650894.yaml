    description: "When using a UIHostingController with a SwiftUI view, it will size itself based on the size of the SwiftUI view. However, it doesn't set the `preferredContentSize` property to that value. This makes it not useful when you try to use that hosting controller as content in a popover.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the workaround I'm using is making a subclass of UIHostingController that just does the following in the viewDidLayoutSubviews method: `preferredContentSize = view.subviews.first?.frame.size ?? .zero`."
