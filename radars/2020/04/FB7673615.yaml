    description: "Although we have safeAreaInsets, it doesn't always serve all the needs. The clear example â€“ [vertical/horizontal]ScrollIndicatorInsets, for bottom horizontal indicator we need a special value that will represent how much we need to inset from screen edge because of display's rounded corners. Mobile Safari, as seen from disassembly, has a complicated mechanism to achieve that, involving use of \r\n_inscribedRectInBoundingPathByInsettingRect:onEdges:withOptions:\r\nBut there is no any equivalent for that method in public api, and thus, no way of solving that problem by non-apple developers rather that hardcode values, which is very bad."
