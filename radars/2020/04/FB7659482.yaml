    description: "See attached project for an example reproduction. But this is a summary of the steps to reproduce this:\r\n\r\n- Create an iOS application targeting iOS 13.4's SDK\r\n- Add a UITextView to the view controller\r\n- Set `keyboardAppearance` on the text view, for example, as a result of rotating the interface (in `viewWillLayoutSubviews`)\r\n- Open app\r\n- Tap on the text view to make the keyboard visible\r\n- Rotate the device\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n- The keyboard appearance changes from light to dark or viceversa\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n- The keyboard appearance that was visible before we rotated remains.\r\n\r\nIf you dismiss the keyboard and show it again, the appearance is now correct."
