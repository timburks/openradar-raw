    description: If I want to see what windows I have open in an app, I can use Mission Control or the Windows menu. If I want to see what windows are open in a current space, I can use Mission Control. What I canâ€™t do is see what windows are open in the current app /only in the current space/. That could be a new Mission Control mode, but it might be simpler to group items in the Windows menu in each app.
