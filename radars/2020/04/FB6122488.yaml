    description: "Basic information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nDebugger output for \"po\" prints \"Couldn't IRGen expression, no additional error\" when using custom binary framework\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nHow to use:\r\nHave Xcode 11 installed\r\nUnzip\r\nOpen FooApp/Serenity-FooApp.xcworkspace\r\nOpen AppDelegate.swift\r\nSet a breakpoint on line 23 `print(\"Run `po foo` -> Does it print `error: Couldn't IRGen expression, no additional error`?\")`\r\nRun until breakpoint is reached\r\nRun `po foo` in the debugger\r\nError should appear (\"Couldn't IRGen expression, no additional error\")\r\n \r\nTo see the source behind the Utility.framework binary or rebuild it:\r\nOpen Utility/Utility.xcproject\r\nTo try the app with a modified binary build the framework (release build) and put the binary into Utility/Release/apple\r\nNote: changing stuff (e.g. removing Result.swift or some other code) fixes the issue. But this fix is random!\r\n\r\n\"po\" cannot be used anymore in the debugger, the only output is \"Couldn't IRGen expression, no additional error\"\r\nsee https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/blob/20926499a0690721c4aa996c169ab540abb8f3a0/source/Plugins/ExpressionParser/Swift/SwiftExpressionParser.cpp#L1744\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease describe the business impact, if any, of the issue you are reporting\r\nDebugger cannot be used anymore"
