    description: "When moving files around by drag'n drop, there is always a green plus as if the files will be copied, even in cases where files are in fact moved.\r\n\r\n1. Select a couple of files in one group\r\n2. Drag'n Drop them to a different group.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nBy default there should be no green plus symbol as the files are moved to the new group, unless ALT is pressed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nThere is always a green plus, whether ALT is pressed or not, yet if ALT is pressed the files are copied, otherwise they are moved."
