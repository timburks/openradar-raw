    description: "With a connected Apple Magic Mouse (or Apple Trackpad) on my 11\" iPad and iOS 13.4, I cannot scroll lists. This includes:\r\n\r\n- Settings (list of categories)\r\n- Home screen (can't scroll to sideways to another screen of apps)\r\n- and many more\r\n\r\n I tried to do that using click&hold&drag (the way scrolling a lists works in Xcode Simulator) and 1 finger (and even 2 finger) scroll on the mouse itself (the way scrolling works in macOS).\r\n\r\nThis makes me very frustrated.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see the linked video from my friend Marcin: https://twitter.com/krzyzanowskim/status/1242725296664653824"
