    description: "Configuration: iPhone Xs Max, iOS 13.4\r\nReproducibility: 100%\r\n\r\nAfter using notification centre all applications stop receiving such lifecycle events as UIApplication.applicationDidBecomeActive(_:) and UIApplication.applicationWillResignActive(_:).\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1 Launch any app with push notifications\r\n2 while application is in foreground state receive a new push notification and expand it by swipe gesture\r\n3 tap «More»\r\n4 tap on «Settings»\r\n5 navigate back to the application\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\napplicationDidBecomeActive would be called\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe only applicationWillEnterForeground is called\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nKilling an app and opening again changes nothing. System-wide these lifecycle methods are not delivered to any application anymore.\r\nOnly applicationWillEnterForeground and applicationDidEnterBackground work.\r\n\r\nTo fix this required either to restart the device or to receive new push a tap «view»\r\nAfter that, all lifecycle methods are fixed and delivered.\r\n\r\nThese lifecycle events are crucial to add/remove blur on switching between apps and protect users from exposing their private info"
