    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nWhen running UI tests, an XCUIElement representing a text field returns its placeholder value when there is no text typed into it (e.g. `text` property is `nil` or an empty string). It's expected that `value` would not return the placeholder value, as the XCUIElementAttributes protocol provides the `placeholderValue` property, as well as `value`.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Run the UI tests.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n`XCUIElementTextFieldValueUITests.testTextFieldValue()` passes.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n`XCUIElementTextFieldValueUITests.testTextFieldValue()` fails the assertion check: \"XCTAssertEqual failed: (\"My Placeholder Text\") is not equal to (\"\")\""
