    description: "I've downloaded iTunes 12.6.5.3 for Mac and Windows from here:\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208079\r\n\r\nThe Windows version DOES NOT exhibit this bug.\r\n\r\nSince March 15th, the MacOS version cannot download or update iOS apps.   Prior to March 15th it worked OK.  MacOS High Sierra is the latest version of MacOS that this version of iTunes is supported on (as per the support note above it will not run on Mojave or Catalina).\r\n\r\nInstall new app fail\r\n1. start iTunes\r\n2. switch to app view\r\n3. click on \"App Store\" tab.\r\n4. purchase app/get free app (eg: TikTok)\r\n5. window briefly flashes \"downloading ...\"\r\n6. app is not downloaded\r\n\r\nUpdate fail\r\n1. start iTunes\r\n2. switch to app view\r\n3. click on updates tab\r\n4. click on \"Update All Apps\" button\r\n5. window briefly flashes \"downloading ...\"\r\n6. no apps are updated\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the windows version works, and the mac version does not, then the implication is that Apple wants us to use the Windows version and retire our macs.  I suspect this was not Apple's intention.\r\n\r\nDiagnostics attached"
