    description: For operations that Voice Control can’t do easily, it would be nice™ if they could be summoned by keyboard shortcut. This includes both menu items and things like web-page-specific hotkeys (not to mention poorly-written apps that directly respond to key events), so simply allowing quick access to menu items wouldn’t achieve the full purpose.
