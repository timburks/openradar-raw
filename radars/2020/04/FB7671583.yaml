    description: "The system ui element RPSystemBroadcastPickerView does not function in an application using new UIScene lifecycle. \r\n\r\nWhen tapping the Start Broadcast button, the broadcast does not start and the following error is seen in the logs: \r\n\r\n[Assert] Error in UIKit client: -[UIWindow setScreen:] should not be called if the client adopts UIScene lifecycle. Call -[UIWindow setWindowScene:] instead.\r\n\r\nThis view works as expected when using the AppDelegate to manage the application lifecycle."
