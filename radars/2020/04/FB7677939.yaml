    description: "Since the signing certificates expired in 2019, a new version of the macOS 10.12 Sierra installer was posted for download at https://support.apple.com/HT208202 Within this version however, there is something broken, so that the 'createinstallmedia' tool cannot be used with it. It only gives the misleading error message '/Volumes/XYZ is not a valid volume mount point.'\r\nFrom some reports of others I could find in the net, I can conclude that there seems to be a kind of validation going on on the supplied '--applicationpath' which fails as the new installer has a 'CFBundleShortVersionString' of '12.6.06' while the previous one had '12.6.03'.\r\nPlease fix this downloadable version, so that it is possible again to create an non-expired install boot stick of Sierra."
