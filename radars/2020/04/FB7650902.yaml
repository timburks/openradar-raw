    description: When using the `popover` modifier in SwiftUI on iOS it should set the size of the popover based on the content shown inside of it. It seems to do this when you use the modifier on macOS, but on iOS it's a static, somewhat large size. To reproduce just use the modifier with a small view for the content.
