    description: "When using Voice Control, if there’s a word it doesn’t know, it’s hard to get it to type what you want. A series of corrections, deletions of spaces, and lowercasing can eventually get to the right place, but it’d be much easier if there were a “spell” command to go with the “literal” command.\r\n\r\n(Related to my just-filed FB7678947, about manual keypresses, which would also solve this problem…if a little more clunkily.)"
