    description: Using the NSMutableAttributedString and adding a text attachment with an image is no longer working as expected in iOS 13. In iOS 12 and below I am able to trigger a tap by implementing the delegate function shouldInteractWith textAttachment. In iOS 13 that function does not get triggered unless I long press on that image.
