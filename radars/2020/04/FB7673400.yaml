    description: "We disable header maps (USE_HEADERMAP = NO) to enforce that C++ headers are included using their complete path (e.g., \"mycompany/foo.hpp\", not just \"foo.hpp\"). When using the New Build System, this breaks the Issue Navigator: it doesn't jump to an error in the editor when clicking on an issue in a header. The Issue Navigator works when using the Legacy Build System.\r\n\r\nThe example project is the macOS Command Line Tool template with \"USE_HEADERMAP = NO\" and \"HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = include\" set at project scope.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/ryb-ableton/XcodeNewBuildSystemIssueNavigatorBug\r\n2. Open \"XcodeNewBuildSystemIssueNavigatorBug.xcodeproj\"\r\n3. Build\r\n4. Open the Issue Navigator pane\r\n5. Click on the error (on the \"I'm an error - try to navigate to me\" text)\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nXcode jumps to the error in the editor\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nAn alert sound is played and Xcode does not open \"foo.h\""
