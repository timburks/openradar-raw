    description: "A test project to reproduce the bug can be found at: https://github.com/advantej/VoiceOverBug\r\n\r\nThe following steps were performed on a iPhone X, iOS 13.2\r\n\r\n1. Run the VoiceOverBug application and observe that there is one cell with a red background color in a table view which has a green background color (see screenshots at: https://github.com/advantej/VoiceOverBug/blob/master/README.md)\r\n2. Turn on voice over\r\n3. With the accessibility focus on the cell, swipe left. The cell disappears from the view hierarchy. (Red view is gone.) Confirm this in the view hierarchy debugger. (see screenshots at https://github.com/advantej/VoiceOverBug/blob/master/README.md)\r\n4. Sometimes a combination of left/right swipes are needed to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nWhen the issue is observed, the following assertion is seen in the debugger:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-04-20 12:00:48.490943-0700 VoiceOverBug[1959:1403324] [AXCommon] *** Assertion failure in -[NSObject(AXPrivCategory) _accessibilitySearchSubtreesAfterChildElement:direction:searchType:allowOutOfBoundsChild:range:shouldScrollToVisible:], NSObjectAccessibility.m:8722: We should always have been able to find the index of the child[<UITableView: 0x103858600; frame = (0 44; 375 734); clipsToBounds = YES; autoresize = RM+BM; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x283ae1620>; layer = <CALayer: 0x28349dae0>; contentOffset: {0, -993}; contentSize: {375, 1350}; adjustedContentInset: {0, 0, 0, 0}; dataSource: <VoiceOverBug.ViewController: 0x102c0b990>>] element if we had one to begin with <VoiceOverBug.MyTableViewCell: 0x102b112c0; baseClass = UITableViewCell; frame = (0 0; 375 1350); clipsToBounds = YES; hidden = YES; autoresize = W; layer = <CALayer: 0x2834b2b80>>\r\n```"
