    description: "STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n0. Open Voice Control preferences\r\n1. Open Commands\r\n2. Create a new custom command to “Paste Text” in Any Application. I used “hello hello” as the key phrase and “goodbye” as the text.\r\n3. Try to use this new command in, say, a Feedback description.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\nThe text appears, as if I’d typed “goodbye” or said “type goodbye”.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS\r\nThe command is recognized (per the dictation overlay window) but then the computer just beeps."
