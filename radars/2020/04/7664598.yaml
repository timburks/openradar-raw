    description: "See attached file containing the demo app.\r\n\r\nMultiline label is created with constraints centring it in the container and also with an explicit width constraint. Width constraint is later de-activated. After de-activation, for some width constants (200.0), label is resized to its intrinsic width, while for others (75.0) is keeps the fixed width.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: after deactivation of the explicit width constraint label should be resized to its intrinsic width, regardless of the fixed width value.\r\n\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/v3E79XPM"
