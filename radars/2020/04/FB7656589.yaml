    description: "Xcode regularly shows me an \"Update to recommend settings\" warning in the category \"Validate Project Settings\" about setting changes that would not change anything. E.g. it suggests to enable \"Hardned Runtime\" for targets that already have it enabled because I have this set on project level and ALL MY TARGETS inherit that setting. Apparently the checker only looks at the target settings which is wrong. It must look at the COMBINED settings as Xcode names them. These are the settings that apply when building.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshots."
