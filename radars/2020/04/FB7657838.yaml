    description: "When a user signs up using Hide My Email option in Sign in with Apple, a private relay email address is generated. Emails can be sent to the private relay address only from the registered domains in the developer portal.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have a case in our invoicing app. Our users can create invoices and send them to their customers. To automatically mark the invoices as sent, we send those emails from our domain to their customers on behalf of our users. In those emails, we set our user's email address in the reply-to field of the email so that their customers can get back to our users if they have any concerns regarding the invoice sent.\r\n\r\nBut as we checked, even if we set the private relay email address in the reply-to field of the emails we send, the reply back emails are not getting redirected to the original Apple ID address. We suppose this is because only registered domains can send the emails. But, we can't register all of their customer's domain in our developer portal.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example. But we have lot of other cases where we send various different emails to our user's customers on behalf of our users. So, kindly take this into consideration and make the reply back emails delivered to their original Apple ID address. Thanks in advance."
