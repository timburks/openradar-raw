    description: "(Note that this ticket refers specifically to `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` on Catalyst. See FB7663947 for the related iPadOS ticket. To my knowledge, `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` has never worked on Catalyst, unlike iPadOS, where it has worked until iPadOS 13.4.)\r\n\r\nOn Mac Catalyst, ICCameraFile's `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` method does not read data from the camera file.\r\n\r\nWhen `requestReadData` is called with an offset of 0 and a length corresponding to the size of the file, the completion block is executed with a nil Data object. (The error is also nil.) The expected result is a Data object with the actual contents of the camera file (and a nil error).\r\n\r\nThe attached project reproduces this sample issue. (There is no app UI; see the messages logged to the console.) This project:\r\n\r\n- Instantiates an ICDeviceBrowser, sets its delegate, and starts its browser.\r\n- When an ICCameraDevice (such as an SD card) is connected, the code automatically sets its delegate, and opens a session.\r\n- When the ICCameraDeviceDelegate's `deviceDidBecomeReady(withCompleteContentCatalog:)` delegate method is called, `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` is called with on the first ICCameraFile object. (Using the first ICCameraFile is arbitrary; the results are the same regardless of which file is chosen.)\r\n- The `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` completion block is subsequently called with a nil Data object, and a nil Error object.\r\n\r\nFor Open Radar: The minimum code sample to reproduce this is at https://gist.github.com/mjrusso/b223bf8db93e64d858e80b6fb8ab6ef8"
