    description: I suggest that the ability to use a custom catalog and/or ignore individual updates be kept in macOS. As a system administrator for a Hollywood animation company, we are not able to update our production computers until pipeline tools are built for a new version of the operating system. We need to be able to block updates until we can successfully update and push pipeline tool updates. This is also very important when Apple QA fails and then pushes bad updates that need a Supplemental update 2 days later. That causes very expensive outages that could be replaced with swapping out Apple devices for Linux or Windows systems where we can manage updates. Our technology department has increasingly talked about leaving the Apple ecosystem because the spiraling loss of administrative ability of macOS in a corporate environment. Each year Apple focuses macOS making it a clone of iOS, alienating the people who used it because it was such a powerful desktop that was great at managing it in the corporate world. Senior VPs say that they are not merging the 2 operating systems while everything that makes macOS a powerful desktop platform for administrators gets removed for a more iOS level of administration. Facts don't lie, and macOS is merging with iOS philosophy despite the 2 facing.
