    description: "Important: this is a regression in iPadOS 13.4. This has worked with previous versions of iPadOS, since beta versions of 13.2.\r\n\r\nOn iPadOS, ICCameraFile's `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` method does not read data from the camera file.\r\n\r\nWhen `requestReadData` is called with an offset of 0 and a length corresponding to the size of the file, the completion block is executed with a non-nil, 0 byte Data object. (The error is nil.) The expected result is a Data object with the actual contents of the camera file (and a nil error), not a 0 byte Data object.\r\n\r\nThe attached project reproduces this sample issue. (There is no app UI; see the messages logged to the console.) This project:\r\n\r\n- Instantiates an ICDeviceBrowser, sets its delegate, and starts its browser.\r\n- (User must tap OK at the permission prompt to access files on connected cameras and storage.)\r\n- When an ICCameraDevice (such as an SD card) is connected, the code automatically sets its delgate, and opens a session.\r\n- When the ICCameraDeviceDelegate's `deviceDidBecomeReady(withCompleteContentCatalog:)` delegate method is called, `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` is called with on the first ICCameraFile object. (Using the first ICCameraFile is arbitrary; the results are the same regardless of which file is chosen.)\r\n- The `requestReadData(atOffset:length:completion:)` completion block is subsequently called with a Data object that is 0 bytes in length.\r\n\r\nExample console output:\r\n\r\n> [DeviceFinder] started ICDeviceBrowser; connect camera device now\r\n> [CameraDevice] session opened\r\n> [CameraDevice] device ready, with complete catalog of 178 items\r\n> [CameraDevice] about to requestReadData for file '　 　 \U0001F141 |    DSCF2030.RAF | 0 |                ' with size 50544640\r\n> [CameraFile] in requestReadData completion block\r\n> *** [CameraFile] data read via requestReadData is empty!\r\n\r\nInstead, the expected output is:\r\n\r\n> [DeviceFinder] started ICDeviceBrowser; connect camera device now\r\n> [CameraDevice] session opened\r\n> [CameraDevice] device ready, with complete catalog of 178 items\r\n> [CameraDevice] about to requestReadData for file '　 　 \U0001F141 |    DSCF2030.RAF | 0 |                ' with size 50544640\r\n> [CameraFile] in requestReadData completion block\r\n> *** [CameraFile] data read via requestReadData has 50544640 bytes!\r\n\r\nFor Open Radar: The minimum code sample to reproduce this is at https://gist.github.com/mjrusso/b223bf8db93e64d858e80b6fb8ab6ef8"
