    description: "/usr/bin/ssh in macos 10.15.4 hangs if used with the -p flag to specify an alternate port and used with a hostname.  This was not present in macos 10.15.3\r\n\r\nFor example, assuming hostname is a valid hostname, 1.2.3.4 is its corresponding IP address, and on the target hostname, ssh is running on both the default port 22 and a second port, 8822:\r\n\r\nThe following work as expected:\r\n\r\nssh hostname\r\nssh 1.2.3.4\r\nssh -p 8822 1.2.3.4\r\n\r\nHowever, this will hang forever until interrupted:\r\n\r\nssh -p 8822 hostname\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it doesn't matter what port or hostname you use, as long as it isn't a numeric IP address.  For example, all of these will hang as well:\r\n\r\nssh -p 8888 hostname\r\nssh -p 8822 hostname-that-does-not-exist\r\n\r\nIn contrast, using an invalid port with a numeric IP address gives the expected error:\r\n\r\nssh -p 8888 1.2.3.4\r\nssh: connect to host 1.2.3.4 port 8888: Connection refused\r\n\r\nAnd using an invalid hostname without the -p switch also gives the expected error:\r\n\r\nssh hostname-that-does-not-exist\r\nssh: Could not resolve hostname hostname-that-does-not-exist: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\r\n\r\nUsing maximum verbosity doesn't give any clues, and max debugging on the sshd target host shows no connection is ever initiated:\r\n\r\nssh -vvv -p 8822 hostname\r\nOpenSSH_8.1p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3\r\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\r\ndebug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 47: Applying options for *\r\ndebug1: Connecting to hostname port 8822.\r\n\r\nnetstat shows no connection attempt being made"
