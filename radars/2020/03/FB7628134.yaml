    description: "Some built-in apps like Messages allow custom vibration pattern to be set for their notifications. For example, we can set a custom vibration pattern for Messages.app in Settings > Notifications > Messages > Sounds > Vibration.\r\n\r\nThis function is not present for third-party apps, but really should be. This would be very helpful for users to differentiate their alerts from different apps."
