    description: My screensaver (flurry) came on as normal, I jogged the mouse/keyboard as normal, but then it wouldn’t let me type in my password. Clicking on the password field, and also on “Cancel”, did nothing. There was no blinking caret in the password field, and my typing did nothing. I had to force quit (cmd-opt-shift-esc), at which point the screensaver stopped, and the blinking caret appeared and I could enter my password.
