    description: "UIViewControllers that adopt the UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate protocol and set the presentationController?.delegate will not be released from memory when dismissed if the modally presented UIViewController is inside a UINavigationController.\r\n\r\n\r\ndeinit will not be called on the modally presented view controller. Instruments will confirm the leak as well.\r\n\r\nThis happens when the Deployment Target is iOS 11 or iOS 13."
