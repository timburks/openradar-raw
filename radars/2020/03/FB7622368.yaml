    description: "Xcode does not seem to honor system settings when performing network requests for the Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM).\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n0. Make sure you have to use an enterprise proxy to access sites like github.com.\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project.\r\n2. In the project navigator, select your project (usually the topmost item).\r\n3. In the “PROJECT” list, select your project, then click “Swift Packages” at the top.\r\n4. Click the “+” button to add a dependency.\r\n5. Enter “https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs.git” as the package URL (without quotation marks)\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n6. Xcode displays a sheet “Verifying OHHTTPStubs.git” for a brief moment.\r\n7. Xcode displays a screen with information about the repository and request version specification information (such as “version: up to next major; 9.0.0 < 10.0.0”).\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n6. Xcode displays a sheet “Verifying OHHTTPStubs.git” for 90–100 seconds.\r\n7. Xcode displays another sheet on top: “An unknown error occurred”"
