    description: "On iOS 13 Home app shows a wrong German translation when a blind is fully open.\r\n\r\nWhen a blind is fully closed, Home app shows “Geschlossen” (“Closed” in English). (That’s correct)\r\n\r\nWhen a blind is fully open, Home app shows “Öffnen” (To “Open” in English). (That’s wrong)\r\nIt should actually show “Offen” (“Open” in English).\r\n\r\nApple Home running on iOS 12 shows the correct word “Offen” when the blind is fully open."
