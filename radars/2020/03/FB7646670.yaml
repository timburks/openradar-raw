    description: "I noticed 2 issues with the up/down message list navigation arrows in Mail on iOS 13.4. The buttons now are activating on touch down rather than the expected touch up. And the down button has a high mis-press rate, it seems its touch area is too small, tapping a little to the left of the icon works better.\r\n\r\nTo test this out, go in Mail, Inbox and select a message down the list. Press the up arrow but hold your finger, you will see it changes the message before you lift up. Try and use the down arrow and you will see it barely works at all, press a little to the left and it works."
