    description: "MLUpdateTask objects are not released after trainings ended. Application code after training doesnâ€™t have any references to CoreML related objects, but they still in the memory.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to reproduce the issue just use Apple sample code https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/core_ml_api/personalizing_a_model_with_on-device_updates\r\n\r\n1. Run the sample application\r\n2. Make some trainings\r\n3. Open Debug Memory Graph\r\n4. Observe that MLUpdateTask objects are not released and consume ram space\r\n\r\nExpected: MLUpdateTask objects should have been released after trainings\r\nUnexpected: MLUpdateTask objects are not released after trainings\r\n\r\nModel used for training is simple K Nearest Neighbors Classifier with input image size 227x227."
