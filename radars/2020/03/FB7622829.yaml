    description: "When making purchases using watchOS 6.4 beta (this has been happening on all beta versions released as of 03/11/2020): \r\n- The purchase goes through correctly, I get the iOS prompts for the App Store password, and confirm the purchase.\r\n- However, the SKReceiptRefreshRequest fails, and the receipt is not stored on device. When trying to fetch the receipt in the appStoreReceiptURL, the file is not present. \r\n- The iOS version of the very same app works correctly and succeeds in fetching the receipt. \r\n- I’m logged out of the App Store account on both iPhone and Watch, and logged into a Sandbox account on both. \r\n- The Sandbox account is correctly configured for the app and works correctly on the iOS version. \r\n- The confirmation prompts on the watch correctly show that I’m using the Sandbox environment."
