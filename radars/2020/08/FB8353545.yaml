    description: "The AppKit project has often shipped their release notes on a separate page from the main macOS release notes, but Feedback Assistant’s version of the macOS release notes does not provide a way to view them. For macOS Big Sur 11 Beta 4, there’s a line\r\n\r\n> See AppKit Release Notes for macOS Big Sur 11 . [sic]\r\n\r\nbut it is not a link."
