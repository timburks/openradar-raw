    description: "The traffic hotspotted to an iOS device that is connected to a VPN does not go through the VPN tunnel. \r\nHere are the steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- iPhone on iOS 13.5 is connected to a VPN and has hotspot enabled\r\n- Connect a Mac to the iPhone's hotspot\r\n- Check the Mac IP. The real iPhone's IP is seen by the mac. \r\n- I expect that the traffic hotspotted goes through the VPN tunnel\r\n\r\nIs it technically possible to send the traffic coming from the hotspot connection to the VPN tunnel in iOS?"
