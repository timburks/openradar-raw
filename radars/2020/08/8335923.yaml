    description: "Latest build of Safari has stopped rendering our games if using WebGL. This is fine previously before iOS14/Safari 14.\r\n\r\nhttps://mo-demo.wi-gameserver.com/resource-service/game.html?game=americanroulette&partnercode=mockpartner&realmoney=false&demo=true&gaffing=true\r\n\r\nWe have tested an this was broken on xcode release 1 but fixed in xcode release 2 on Safari but we want to ensure this is resolved on iOS also.\r\n\r\nWe don't see any changes for webGL logged in the safari 14 changelog so we are unsure what is has caused this change.\r\n\r\nWhen loading the game with canvasrendering forced (extra url parameter) the game loads on safari as expected. Link for this below.\r\nhttps://mo-demo.wi-gameserver.com/resource-service/game.html?game=americanroulette&partnercode=mockpartner&realmoney=false&demo=true&gaffing=true&canvasrendering=true \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1.) Follow this link on safari 14 MacOs or iOS14 safari: https://mo-demo.wi-gameserver.com/resource-service/game.html?game=americanroulette&partnercode=mockpartner&realmoney=false&demo=true&gaffing=true\r\n2.) Note the WebGL fails to render.\r\n3.) Follow same link on previous safari build and notice this issue was not present before.\r\n\r\nPlease advise."
