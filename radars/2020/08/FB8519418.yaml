    description: "Please consider making OS_ACTIVITY_STREAM public. Itâ€™s often extremely useful to have a streaming log access in apps, especially during beta testing times. Currently, most folks do not use os_log or shim os_log which makes it lose most of the benefits it offers, so that a streaming log can be implemented.\r\n\r\nIt would be much faster and more efficient to use the existing streaming functionality directly. \r\n\r\nSee following example project, which would be great to have without using the private ActivityStreamSPI.h\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/steipete/459a065f905a41f8f577fb02ef34206e\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apple/llvm-project/blob/apple/master/lldb/tools/debugserver/source/MacOSX/DarwinLog/ActivityStreamSPI.h\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this feature."
