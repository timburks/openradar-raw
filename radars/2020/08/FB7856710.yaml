    description: "Hi\r\n\r\nWe are developing an app, where password autofill is enabled via webcredentials associated domain.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of passwords saved in Keychain in my device, however, when I open the app, only three passwords are presented in the input toolbar. I often need another account to sign into, but there is no way to chose this user.\r\n\r\nIn Web there is usually “key” button in a toolbar, from where you can access “all saved passwords” screen. But, for some reason, this key button is missing in our app.\r\n\r\nWhen keyboard attached, the passwords toolbar is also missing, unless you detach and reattach the keyboard, which is quite inconvenient to do every time you want to sign in."
