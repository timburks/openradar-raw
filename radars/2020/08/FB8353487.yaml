    description: "The attached file [omitted for Open Radar] uses Shift-JIS, but mistakenly got an xattr claiming it was UTF-8:\r\n\r\ncom.apple.TextEncoding: utf-8;134217984\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, TextEdit refused to open this file, claiming that the contents weren’t valid UTF-8. What /was/ surprising is that even when I used the “Options” pane in TextEdit’s Open window to choose Shift-JIS, TextEdit /still/ refused to open the file and /still/ claimed that the contents were invalid UTF-8. It wasn’t until I deleted the xattr that it respected my choice in the Open window, at which point it had no trouble loading the file as Shift-JIS. Saving it also correctly wrote Shift-JIS into the com.apple.TextEncoding xattr.\r\n\r\nRunning macOS Catalina 10.15.5 (19F101), which has TextEdit 1.15 (355)."
