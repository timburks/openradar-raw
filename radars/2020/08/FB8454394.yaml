    description: "In iOS 14, user can be asked if they allow to be tracked with usage of AppTrackingTransparency framework. If user responds \"Allow Tracking\" in pop up dialog (ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized) and if attempt to communicate with iAd framework with usage of requestAttributionDetailsWithBlock: method is attempted, iOS terminates the app. In every subsequent app launch (dialog doesn't show up anymore, but state remains ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized), app will crash when requestAttributionDetailsWithBlock: is called. If state ever changes to ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied, attempt to call requestAttributionDetailsWithBlock: ends up in success.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Upon app launch, ask for consent to be tracked with usage of requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler: from AppTrackingTransparency framework.\r\n2. Reply \"Allow Tracking\" in pop up dialog.\r\n3. Attempt to invoke requestAttributionDetailsWithBlock: method of ADClient class (app will be terminated in this moment)."
