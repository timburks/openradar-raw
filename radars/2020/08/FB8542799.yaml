    description: "Hi, \r\n\r\nthere seems to a discrepancy in the behaviour in an app compiled with Xcode 11 and 12 when calling `popToViewController(_:animated:)` on a navigation controller embedded in an `UITabBarController`. When we consecutively push two view controllers with `hidesBottomBarWhenPushed: true` and then call `popToViewController(_:animated:)` with the first view controller as an argument the app compiled with Xcode 11 will pop to the desired view controller and unhide the tab bar as expected, but the app compiled with Xcode 12 will pop to the desired view controller and keep the tab bar hidden. This issue is amplified by the new `UIMenu` history shown when long-pressing on the back button as `popToViewController(_:animated:)` seems to be called. I've attached sample project compilable in both Xcode 11 and 12.\r\n\r\nPreconditions:\r\n- Xcode 12\r\n- `UINavigationController` with a root view controller, embedded in `UITabBarController`\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Push a view controller with `hidesBottomBarWhenPushed: true`\r\n2. Push another view controller with `hidesBottomBarWhenPushed: true`\r\n3. Call `popToViewController(_:animated:)` on the navigation controller with the first (root view controller) as an argument or long-press on the back button and select the first (oldest) view controller\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nThe tab bar is unhidden\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe tab bar stays hidden\r\n\r\nThank you, stay safe"
