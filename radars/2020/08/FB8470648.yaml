    description: "According to https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizer/3538974-buttonmask?language=objc we can see that buttonMask is a new property added since ios 13.4.\r\n\r\nHowever, during my development process, I found that I cannot get the correct value from a UIGestureRecognizer instance. It always equals to 0. Actually it should equals to 1 if current button is primary, 2 if secondary.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that we can get the correct value from its derived class like the following way,\r\n```\r\n- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {\r\n   NSLog(@“%s event.buttonMask:%d”, __func__, event.buttonMask);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEven so, we cannot access it from the base class instance, and 'buttonMask' is readonly, we cannot change its value.\r\n\r\nIf you think it is indeed a mistake, can you solve this problem? This will greatly help our development. Thank you very much!"
