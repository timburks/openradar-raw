    description: "`.onDrop` modifier does not work when applied to a view(s) inside the `List`. It works when used inside `ScrollView` but there we lose the edit mode, swipe-to-delete, context menu, and other, `List` related features.\r\n\r\nNote that the `onInsert` modifier works as expected, even in the `List`.\r\n\r\nDrag & Drop is an essential feature for multitasking, and not having the ability to use `onDrop` is a major shortcoming."
