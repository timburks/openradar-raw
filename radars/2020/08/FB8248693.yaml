    description: "We are using Bitrise as a CI machine for our project and one of the dependencies is an SPM package, hosted in a private GitHub repository.\r\n\r\nLocally, everything works great.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we are trying to configure Bitrise, we always get errors like\r\nCommand line invocation:\r\n    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies\r\nResolve Package Graph\r\nFetching git@github.com:<redacted>.git\r\nxcodebuild: error: Could not resolve package dependencies:\r\n  Authentication failed because the credentials were rejected\r\n\r\nOn the same machine, \r\n`git clone git@github.com:<redacted>.git`\r\nworks great.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if we are doing something wrong, or xcodebuild does not respect the SSH configuration when it resolves the dependencies, or something is not compatible with GitHub SSH.\r\n\r\nBut we were not able to make it work and had to switch to GitHub Private Access Tokens, which is less secure and less convenient in our case.\r\n\r\nGitHub PATs are attached to an account, not a repository. And putting GitHub PAT into CI, gives CI access to all other repositories available from this account, not only to the SPM repo. With SSH keys we could in theory add separate repository-level keys to our main repo and SPM repo.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nAdd private GitHub repo as SPM package in Xcode via SSH.\r\nTry to resolve dependencies on a CI like Bitrise.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nPrivate SPM package is resolved correctly, when `git clone` works on the same machine for this repository\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n`git clone` works, but xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies fails with “Authentication failed because the credentials were rejected”"
