    description: "UICollectionViewListCells were introduced in iOS 14 betas and are meant to superseed UITableView in the near future.\r\nHowever, to the best of my knowledge, UICollectionView does not provide a way to give a UICollectionViewListCell a highlighting behavior similar to UITableView's; instead, the cell stays selected by default.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can avoid the issue by manually requesting that the UICollectionView deselects the tapped cell after a brief interval - or possibly via UIListContentConfiguration - I believe that this behavior should be provided out-of-the-box."
