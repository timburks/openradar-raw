    description: "When I try to open a stringsdict file that starts with an XML comment\r\nThen I get an error message “Tried to create a document (class: IDEPlistDocument) and got a document with a different, non-conforming fileType back instead.” And the document does not open.\r\n\r\nAdd the following XML as a stringsdict file, and try and open it in Xcode:\r\n<!--\r\n * Apple Stringsdict File\r\n * Generated by Twine 1.0.3.1\r\n * Language: en -->\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\r\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\r\n<dict>\r\n</dict>\r\n</plist>\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nTo see an empty stringsdict file\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nError message “Tried to create a document (class: IDEPlistDocument) and got a document with a different, non-conforming fileType back instead.” And the document does not open."
