    description: "We have a situation where:\r\n* we have a library A distributed as an xcframework.\r\n* this library A is used in a swift package B that includes it as a binary target.\r\n* our final iOS App uses our swift package B with swift package manager.\r\n\r\nWe first had issues with code signing and solved it by adding a copy framework phase then a build phase that code sign the framework A when building the App:\r\ncodesign -f -v --sign \"23V736L7E8\" ${CODESIGNING_FOLDER_PATH}/Frameworks/TestFramework.framework\r\n\r\nNow everything is fine when running in debug on device but when trying to archive the App, we have a compilation error saying Xcode doesn’t find the framework A.\r\nWe try a lots of different setup but didn’t find any solution to fix this compilation error.\r\n\r\nAny idea on how we could solve this issue?\r\n\r\nHere is another link to our sample project: https://github.com/zocario/swiftpm_archive_binary_target"
