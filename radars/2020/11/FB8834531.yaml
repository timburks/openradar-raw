    description: "Randomly on different devices, it appears that the setting \"Call blocking and Identification\" from native Telephone settings is missing.\r\n\r\nIt is then impossible to activate or deactivate the callKit extension for an application.\r\n\r\nBefore iOS14, we noticed that the update of the list of apps in this section could take some time to be updated after the installation of an app.\r\nNow this is globally the menu entry that is totally missing sometimes.\r\n\r\nMany complaints on the store for our application (Orange Telephone) and also on other support sites for other applications that use this setting.\r\n\r\nPresent in Developer forum for 14.2 but already present in previsous versions : https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/662568"
