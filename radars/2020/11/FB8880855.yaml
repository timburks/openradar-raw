    description: When using the contentFilters property of an NSView, a custom Core Image filter fails to do anything on Big Sur.  The same thing did work on Catalina.  The filter works on Big Sur if instead you apply it to a CIImage built from a CGImageRef.  Apple's built-in Core Image filters do work in contentFilters on Big Sur.  It doesn't matter whether the custom filter is written using Metal or Core Image Kernel Language.
