    description: "Basic information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nCloned simulators in UI Test execute in parallel not available simulator push notifications\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nXcode\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDetails\r\nWhat version of Xcode are you using?\r\nXcode 11.4.1\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nThe cloned simulator created when running UI Tests with \"execute in parallel\" selected is not able to receive \"xcrun simctl push …\" push notification messages. Also, running \"xcrun simctl list\" does not list the cloned simulator.\r\n\r\nBecause of this bug, I am not able to automate the process of testing push notifications.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Open the attached sample app\r\n2. Build and run\r\n3. Allow push notifications\r\n4. Stop app\r\n5. Product->Test to run SampleAppUITests\r\n6. In Console log (View->Debug Area->Activate Console if not visible), search for \"Simulator UDID: \"\r\n7. Select and copy UDID string\r\n8. In Terminal: 'xcrun simctl push <udid> com.rsmcalister.SampleApp <path to SampleApp>/SampleApp/SampleApp-apns.json'\r\n9. Response \"Notification sent to 'com.rsmcalister.SampleApp'\" in Terminal\r\n9. Push notification received in Simulator \r\n\r\n10. Product->Scheme->Edit Scheme\r\n11. Click Options… for SampleAppUITests and Select \"Execute in parallel\"\r\n12. Repeat steps 5-8 (Note: you might have to go into Settings app to turn on Notifications for SampleAll in Simulator clone)\r\n13. Response \"Invalid device: <UDID>\" in Terminal\r\n14. Push notification not received in Simulator clone\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI expect to be able to send push notifications to Simulator in both modes, parallel or default.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nDuring UI tests with \"Execute in parallel\" selected\r\n- Response \"Invalid device: <UDID>\" in Terminal\r\n- Push notification not received in Simulator clone"
