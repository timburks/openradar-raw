    description: "On iOS 14.2, when using the TabView in SwiftUI in combination with a PageTabViewStyle, the onAppear function of its children will be called excessively. When running the app on iOS 14, onAppear is called exactly once for each child when it appears.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Add the following code to a view:\r\nTabView {\r\n    Text(\"First text\")\r\n        .onAppear {\r\n            print(\"First text appeared\")\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    Text(\"Second text\")\r\n        .onAppear {\r\n            print(\"Second text appeared\")\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    Text(\"Third text\")\r\n        .onAppear {\r\n            print(\"Third text appeared\")\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    Text(\"Fourth text\")\r\n        .onAppear {\r\n            print(\"Fourth text appeared\")\r\n        }\r\n}.tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle(indexDisplayMode: .never))\r\n\r\n- run the app in a simulator or on a device\r\n- swipe through the tabs\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n- The message is printed once when swiping between tabs.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n- (iOS 14.2) The message is printed multiple times when swiping between tabs.\r\n- (iOS 14) The message is printed once when swiping between tabs."
