    description: "When trying to run a gradle task (any task, may be the generic \"./gradlew tasks\" task) in Xcode Pre-Actions for Build through Xcode - it works. When trying to run it though xcodebuild from the command line - the ./gradlew process hangs. \r\n\r\nThis must mean that there is some difference in the running environment (some constraints on forking or permissions) between the GUI Xcode and CLI xcodebuild.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\nOpen attached project in Xcode\r\nPress play\r\nListen for \"One\" and \"Two\"\r\n\r\nOpen Terminal\r\nxcodebuild -project GradlePreActionTest.xcodeproj -scheme GradlePreActionTest clean build\r\nRun the above command\r\nListen for One and never get to Two as the project hangs\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nBoth ways of running the Pre-Action script produce the same result\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nRunning the Pre-action through xcodebuild makes gradle hang"
