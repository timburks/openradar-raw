    description: "ld64 learned about response files (`ld @cmd.txt`) in Xcode 12. That's great! But it crashes on many response files, so we can't use this new feature.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Download shell_dialogs_unittests.rsp from https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1147968#c18 ; also attached\r\n2. Run `ld @shell_dialogs_unittests.rsp`\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nShouldn't crash.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nsegmentation fault"
