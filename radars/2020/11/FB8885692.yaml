    description: "In the Electron framework, spawning any child process takes a significantly longer amount of time in Big Sur than it does in macOS 10.15 Catalina.\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n- The slowdown only happens on code signed apps.\r\n- The slowdown only happens when spawning the child process from Electron's \"renderer\" process. Spawning from the \"main\" process is much faster (although still seemingly slower than on Catalina).\r\n\r\n# To Reproduce\r\nA sample repo demonstrating spawning the \"ls\" child process is available here:\r\nhttps://github.com/descriptinc/electron-spawn-perf-bug\r\n\r\nThis repo is available as a pre-built sample app here:\r\nhttps://github.com/descriptinc/electron-spawn-perf-bug/releases/tag/1.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Environment\r\nTested on Electron Versions:\r\n10.1.3\r\n10.1.4\r\n11.0.0-beta.13\r\n11.0.0-beta.17\r\n\r\nTested on Operating Systems:\r\nmacOS 11.0 Beta (20A5395g)\r\nmacOS 11.0.1 Beta (20B5022a)\r\n\r\nThis issue is not present in any Electron version on macOS 10.15 Catalina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Expected Behavior\r\nIf I call require('child_process').spawn('ls', ['.']), it should return quickly (<10ms).\r\n\r\nMeasurable with:\r\n\r\nconst { spawn } = require('child_process');\r\nconst start = Date.now();\r\nspawn('ls', ['.']);\r\nconsole.log(`spawn sync time: ${Date.now() - start}`);\r\nActual Behavior\r\n\r\n# Actual Behavior\r\nIf run in a renderer process with nodeIntegration: true, it takes 300+ ms. When used with ffmpeg (our real-world case), we're seeing it go as long as 2-3 seconds, which leads me to think it's related to the binary size/code signing?"
