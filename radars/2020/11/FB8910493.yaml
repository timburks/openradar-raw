    description: "When using AVAudioEngine to play back audio:\r\n- Changing the mainMixer properties to control volume causes an exception (crash). This is literally how it's documented, so it's really broken.\r\n- Changing the volume property of an AVAudioPlayerNode has no effect on volume.\r\n- The only functioning way to control volume was to wire an AVAudioUnitEQ in and change the globalGain property, which is clearly not the intended approach.\r\n\r\nA sample project was supplied.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: my error, as I had connected the output of my eq node to the outputNode rather than the mainMixerNode."
