    description: "# Overview\r\n\r\nThe `clone(recursive:)` documentation states: \r\n\r\n`Resource`s referenced in components are not duplicated. (Resources can be shared between entities.)\r\n\r\nHowever, when an entity with a mesh resource is cloned, the mesh appears to be duplicated.\r\n\r\n## Attachments\r\n\r\nThe attached zip file contains a sample Ball Pit application and iPhone 12 Pro screen recording. The application adds a ball entity to the scene when the screen is tapped. After adding approximately 100 ball entities to the scene, the app's memory footprint increases by 40 MB. This memory increase combined with a one-to-one entity, draw call mapping suggests geometry is not shared between cloned entities. Based on the documentation, I would expect `MeshResource`s to be shared."
