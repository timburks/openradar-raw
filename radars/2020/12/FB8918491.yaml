    description: "If a project has enabled entitlements for Contacts and Calendar access, as soon as EKEventStore is created, Contacts permission request dialog appears (for first time). Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create simple macOS application\r\n2. Enable Contacts and Calendar in Hardened Runtime Section (ensure to provide \"Privacy - Contacts Usage Description\" in Info.plist)\r\n3. Add one line anywhere in the app (e.g. in ViewController’s viewDidLoad): “EKEventStore()”\r\n4. Run application\r\n5. Observe that Contacts permission request dialog appears.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: No dialog should appear until actual access to contacts is requested.\r\n\r\nWhy is this a problem: This leads to bad UX because user doesn’t initiate this flow. One could still use Calendar integration, but not Contacts."
