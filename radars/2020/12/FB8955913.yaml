    description: "Basic Information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nUnable to catch errors thrown from NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest in Swift when HTTP response body is not nil\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nFoundation\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nThe NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest function will return a non-nil value when there is an error, as long as a valid HTTP response was received with a \"Content-Length\" greater than 0. Because of how Swift / Objective-C error interoperability works, the error pointer is only checked if the function itself returns nil.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\n1. Use NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest to call an HTTP endpoint that returns a \"401 Unauthorized\" status code, but also containing content in the body (i.e. Content-Length greater than 0)\r\n2. NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest throws an NSError (specifically \"Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1012\") which can be caught in Swift\r\n\r\nActual Behavior:\r\n1. Use NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest to call an HTTP endpoint that returns a \"401 Unauthorized\" status code, but also containing content in the body (i.e. Content-Length greater than 0)\r\n2. NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest throws an NSError (specifically \"Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1012\") which Swift does not catch because sendSynchronousRequest also returns a non-nil value (an NSData object containing the body of the response). Note that the response (URLResponse) pointer is nil in this case, so by dropping the NSError, it makes it nearly impossible to tell what the actual error/issue is.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm aware that NSURLConnection is deprecated, a Github search for Swift code calling this function ( https://github.com/search?l=Swift&q=NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequest&type=Code ) returns over 1000 results, and so I believe this is worth fixing."
