    description: "When I use UIGraphicsImageRenderer to resize an image, and then save the resized image into a local cache. The image that is stored in the cache has the same size as the original when I do the conversion from data to image. Resizing an image copy has the same behavior.\r\n\r\nI worked around this issue switching to UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions instead."
