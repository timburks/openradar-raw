    description: "In watchOS 7, viewing a grouped notification (from Notification Center) no longer displays any Notification Actions associated with the notification category.\r\n\r\nThis happens to:\r\n\r\n1) notifications grouped because they have the same category and thread ID, and when\r\n2) \"Handles Grouping\" is enabled in the storyboard for the notification category ID in the dynamic long-look interface\r\n\r\nPrinting the value of notificationActions in WKUserNotificationInterfaceController.didReceive(_ notification: UNNotification) would list the actions, but they are not displayed in the interface.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, setting notificationActions to any value in a dynamic interactive notification would also not do anything when viewing a grouped notification from Notification Center.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect watchOS 5 and 6. This behaviour is also inconsistent with the iPhone."
