    description: "1. Start a Time Machine backup.\r\n2. While the backup is in progress (i.e. after it has taken the snapshot), attempt to mount a drive, e.g. with Disk Utility. I'm trying to mount an APFS drive.\r\n\r\nDisk Utility will stop responding until the Time Machine backup is complete.\r\n\r\nThe expected result is that the Time Machine backup should not interfere with mounting other volumes."
