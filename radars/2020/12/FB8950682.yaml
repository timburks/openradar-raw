    description: "I have a UIButton that contains text and a symbol image. I set the adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory property on the titleLabel which allows it to automatically adjust as the user changes the font size. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is no equivalent for the button's imageView. I did try the property, adjustsImageSizeForAccessibilityContentSizeCategory, which is similar but that has no effect.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the attached video you can see that if I change the font size and restart the app it does indeed correctly size the image as expected. So the bug is that it does not have the equivalent of \"adjustsImageSizeForAccessibilityContentSizeCategory\" property on UILabel.\r\n\r\nThis makes for really bad user experience."
