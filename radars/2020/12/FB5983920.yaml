    description: "This feedback was created from radar ID 12514064\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: iTunes displays the bit rate of solely the AUDIO PORTION of a video. \r\n\r\nThat is a small fraction of the actual bit rate of a video.\r\n\r\nHello?  (No, I'm not confusing bits and bytes; iTunes is confusing audio and video(including audio).\r\n\r\nStill seeing this problem, now in Apple Music, as shown in screenshot.  1.0.6.10 (latest)\r\n\r\nExists with all music videos.  For one in screenshot:  Shown as 42MB.  File is 41940796 bytes.\r\nBut (122 kbps) * 197 seconds = 3.00425 megabytes.  3MB != 42 MB.\r\n\r\nStill open over 8 years later."
