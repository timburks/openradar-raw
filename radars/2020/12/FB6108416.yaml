    description: "Summary: Migration Assistant copying files from an APFS system to another will explode sparse files to use up their whole logical size. This causes the receiving system to not be able to fit all the files, even if the disk size is the same as the origin system.\r\nExample: Docker for Mac installs a Docker.raw file which has a logical size of 64 GB but a physical size of 3 GB. On migration this file stops being sparse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Use Migration assistant to move a sparse file from one APFS system to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: It should work if the destination system has as much space as the origin system.\r\n\r\nActual Results: It fails even if the space is presumably there."
