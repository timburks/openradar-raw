    description: "Since iOS 14, many users of my reminder app have reported abnormally loud alert sound from my app’s notifications. I’ve since managed to reproduce this problem 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nThis affects notifications from all apps, but of course, is a lot more noticeable when the notification alert sound is long.\r\n\r\nI’ll illustrate this problem on a popular app, WhatsApp. Choose a long notification alert sound for your message notification, for example, Xylophone.\r\n\r\nEnsure that your ringer switch is enabled, ringer & alerts volume in Settings is set low, Apple Watch is removed (so that notifications are sent to the phone instead of the Watch).\r\n\r\nLock your phone and have someone send you a WhatsApp message. The alert volume is correct at this point as you have set in Settings.\r\n\r\nAt this point, attempt to long press the notification for the expanded notification. In fact, long-pressing any notification in your lock screen, even a notification from another app, would immediately cause the notification alert sound to play at max volume."
