    description: "PDF files are not viewable in a WKWebView when running on a Mac Silicon (M1) Mac Mini. The sample text file can be viewed properly, but the sample PDF file results in a blank screen.\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs with an Objective C base code app, I do not see the issue with a parallel Swift app."
