    description: "I initially encountered this problem by trying to play games that supported controller haptics, but found that I could only get them to work on my iPhone â€“ not my iPad Pro. When I explored the issue, I determined that this is likely because Core Haptics behaves incorrectly in this case.\r\n\r\nWhen using an iOS device that doesn't support haptics (ie iPad Pro) connected to a paired controller that supports haptics (ie PS4 Dualshock), CHHapticDeviceCapability.supportsHaptics returns false.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Start with iPad paired with Dualshock controller on iOS 14.2 (see attached).\r\n1. Download \"HapticControllers\" sample code.\r\n2. Use app to verify that haptics work on the controller, as expected\r\n3. Add the following code to viewDidLoad, appDidFinishLaunching etc (or use the attached)\r\n        var supportsHaptics: Bool = false\r\n        let hapticCapability = CHHapticEngine.capabilitiesForHardware()\r\n        supportsHaptics = hapticCapability.supportsHaptics\r\n4. Using the debugger, verify that supportsHaptics is false after running."
