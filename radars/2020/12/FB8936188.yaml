    description: "I have attached an minimum-setup example project that replicates an issue where the destination of a NavigationLink is not receiving an update when a Binding is changing.\r\n\r\nThis setup mirrors a dynamic application where a ForEach is used to display various NavigationLinks in the Form based on parent data. Weirdly enough, this works if you replace Form with VStack, so I’m curious why this isn’t updating. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior: Checkmarks should update when you pick a different food. \r\nObserved behavior: You can see the favorite food changing outside the NavigationLink Destination, but not inside."
