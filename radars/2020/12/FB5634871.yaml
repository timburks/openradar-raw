    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nGMail and Exchange mailbox types have opposite swipe locations for the Delete and Archive actions (see screenshots).  This means when viewing mail in 'All Inboxes' it is impossible to reliably Archive/Delete mail from the list view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse 'All Inboxes' to view multiple inboxes and try to Archive / Delete mail from the list view by swiping.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nArchive and Delete in consistent locations, either swipe right or swipe left.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nArchive and Delete are shown inconsistently.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B92)\r\n\r\nThis feedback was created from radar ID 46270551"
