    description: "Our app is sending the workout data to Apple Health every 30 minutes,  workout data contains the total distance, total energy burned, startDate, endDate, or duration properties. \r\n\r\nSo the app is sending the workout data for a 30 minutes time interval with the actual duration of the exercise done between the 30 minutes of interval.\r\n\r\nSay for Eg: \r\nPlease refer the Below link, in the interval of 30 minutes. The actual workout is of only 1:32 minutes. \r\nAnd we want this time to be reflected into the HealthKit in the Exercise Ring in the activity app.\r\n\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/7mtiaqhjjpdtdsqp29q5pxf03wmu037u\r\n\r\nCan we send that into Exercise Ring ?\r\n\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/fstlgcbvtty6esldsdg1bdx608xehvb3\r\n\r\nEven the exercise ring is overlapping every time and it is passing the actual goal of 30 minutes.\r\nThe Actual result to be displayed over the ring should be somewhat similar to the ring shown in the below image in the link.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/2vwiz8sojgm7xygler6ai1ixnmkf3si0\r\n\r\nWe are blocked with this issue can you please help me sort out the issue?"
