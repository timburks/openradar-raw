    description: "On connecting a 4k 144hz monitor, macOS caps the refresh rate to 60hz with HDR and 95hz without HDR. This is an indication that DSC is not working correctly. \r\n\r\nOn Catalina, macOS shows 144hz refresh rate correctly. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Get a 4K 144hz monitor such as LG 27GN950 and a MBP 16\" or eGPU enclosure with AMD 5500XT and newer GPU.\r\n2. Connect the MBP or eGPU to the monitor either via TB to DisplayPort or directly DP to DP in case on eGPU.\r\n3. Go to System Preferences > Displays > Option click \"Scaled\" > Tick Show low resolution modes.\r\n4. Only 60hz and 90hz options will be available. \r\n\r\nSeveral people are facing this issue as well.
