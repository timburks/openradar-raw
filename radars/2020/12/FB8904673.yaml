    description: When I try to use the arrow keys to either select individual characters (by using the left and right arrow keys), the cursor does not move; nor does it move when I try to select whole lines of text (by using the up and down arrow keys). I know I didnâ€™t just imagine this feature because the expected behavior occurs everywhere else, but in the Messages composer box. It appears that the behavior is not the result of hardware because this incorrect behavior occurs whether using a Bluetooth keyboard or the built-in keyboard.
