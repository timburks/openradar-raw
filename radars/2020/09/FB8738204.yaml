    description: "When implementing a View, I'd expect to have access to the specified foreground and accent colors in order to make the appearance of my view consistent with the rest of the views in the app.\r\n\r\nThis is currently not possible because `\\EnvironmentValues.foregroundColor` and `\\EnvironmentValues.foregroundColor` exist but are not exposed publicly through the SwiftUI API.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is this code working:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n@Environment(\\.foregroundColor) var foregroundColor\r\n@Environment(\\.accentColor) var accentColor\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever these compilers errors arise being that they're declared as internal:\r\n\r\n- 'foregroundColor' is inaccessible due to 'internal' protection level\r\n- 'accentColor' is inaccessible due to 'internal' protection level\r\n\r\nThis breaks the expected mental model for what can or can't be accessed through the environment, as well as convoluting views with unneeded properties to specify these colors on a per-view basis."
