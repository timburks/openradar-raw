    description: "Summary:\r\n- A child view controller’s view has a subview that is constrained to the safe area layout guide anchors\r\n- The child view controller’s view is added to its parent with constraints (top, left, right, bottom)\r\n- A UIViewProperty animator animates the child view’s top constraint to a constant that would make the top safe area inset in the child view 0 if the animation would complete successfully\r\n- We reverse the animation half way through\r\n- After the animation finishes the child view’s subview jumps up to the now 0 safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee sample project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The child view’s view stays in the final animation step and doesn’t jump up\r\n- The child view’s safe area insets are reevaluated after the animation completes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The child view’s safe area insets top is 0\r\n- The child view’s subviews jumps up (since the safeAreaLayoutGuide is wrong)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 11 Simulator iOS 14.0 (18A372) Xcode 12.0 (12A7209)\r\nBut this seems to have been an issue since iOS 10\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fruitcoder/radar.apple.com/tree/main/FB8699390%20-%20UIViewPropertyAnimator%20reversed%20animation%20produces%20zero%20safe%20area%20insets"
