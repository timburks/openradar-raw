    description: "With UIKit version shipped with Xcode 12.0 (12A7209), calling `UINavigationController.popToViewController(vc, animated: true)` results in the `viewControllers` property containing unexpected controllers. Specifically, if the starting stack has controller\r\n\r\n[a, b, c, d]\r\n\r\n`.popToController(b, animated: true)` would result in the incorrect controller stack after the animation.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\n`.viewControllers` property contains [a, b]\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\n`.viewControllers` property contains [d, a, b]\r\n\r\nIt’s weird. This problem was discovered and discussed here https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/656524\r\n\r\nIn that thread it’s supposed to have been reported as FB8626373 as well. Consider this report a duplicate if that’s the case."
