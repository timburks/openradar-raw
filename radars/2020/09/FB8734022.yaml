    description: "SwiftPM support in Xcode is amazing, but sometimes I just have a single-file script that I don’t want to turn into a package. It would be nice™ if Xcode could implicitly treat those /like/ a package with minimal configuration though, in order to allow code completion and such when editing those scripts. You could detect any combination of #! lines:\r\n\r\n\x19#!/usr/bin/swift\r\n#!/usr/bin/env swift\r\n#!/usr/bin/xcrun swift"
