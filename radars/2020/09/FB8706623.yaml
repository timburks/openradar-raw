    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nWhenever I try to access the \"Developer Documentation\" inside of Xcode the application crashes. I have deleted and reinstalled Xcode 3 times to verify that it was not some sort of installation issue.\r\n\r\nSee the attached Crash.rtf file which is what I also see in the crash report that gets sent to Apple after the crash occurs.\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Select \"Developer Documentation\" from the Help or Window menus.\r\n\r\nXcode 12.0.1 explicitly called out this issue as being resolved; and I have personally verified that the issue is now gone."
