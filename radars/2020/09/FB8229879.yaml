    description: "I noticed that NSPersistentCloudKitContainer stops syncing when running an app on the Simulator and Wi-Fi is turned off and on.\r\n\r\nOn a development machine with Wi-Fi as its only network connection, debug an app that uses NSPersistentCloudKitContainer and perform a context save and test that is working. Then turn the Wi-Fi off and perform another context save. Notice many lines of debug output in the console including 12 instances of \"The Internet connection appears to be offline.\" Now turn the Wi-Fi back on and perform another context save. Syncing never happens again. Even suspending the app with the home button and resuming it again doesn't restart a sync. I believe that sync should survive loss and regaining the network connection so thought I would report this.\r\n\r\nI have attached a xcrun simctl diagnose when in the broken state."
