    description: "WCSession.transferFile method doesn't work on Simulators. \r\nOn iOS, the delegate function \"session didFinishFileTransfer\"is called correctly indicating that the file is correctly sent. But the Watch simulator doesn't receive anything.  \r\n\r\nThe code works on real devices. It doesn't work only on simulators."
