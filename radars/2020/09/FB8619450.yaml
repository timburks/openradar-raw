    description: "I added a Widget target to my project. If I build and run the Widget scheme everything works and I can see the widget in the simulator. But if I try to see the preview (clicking \"resume\") in the Canvas the compilation fails with an error about openssl libcrypto.a not having the correct architecture.\r\n\r\n>ld: in /Users/username/Dev/iPhone Dev/ProjectName/openssl-1.0.2g-iOS/lib/libcrypto.a(cryptlib.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file (/Users/username/Dev/iPhone Dev/ProjectName/openssl-1.0.2g-iOS/lib/libcrypto.a(cryptlib.o)) built for iOS, file '/Users/username/Dev/iPhone Dev/ProjectName/openssl-1.0.2g-iOS/lib/libcrypto.a' for architecture arm64\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n\r\nPlease note that openssl is not in the header search path or the library search path for the Widget target.
