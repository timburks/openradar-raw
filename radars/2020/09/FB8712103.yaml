    description: "1. Open a new tab on the new Start Page.\r\n2. Enable the Background Image setting.\r\n3. Choose a custom background image, such as “Soft Pink” in the “Solid Colors” folder under “Desktop Pictures”.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR\r\nText changes to black, since the previewed background is light.\r\n\r\nACTUAL BEHAVIOR\r\nText remains white.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\nText does change to white after the background is confirmed, so there’s /some/ light/dark detection going on."
