    description: If you try and access UIPencilInteraction.prefersPencilOnlyDrawing on a device running iOS 13.0, it will crash the application. The behaviour is expected as UIPencilInteraction.prefersPencilOnlyDrawing is a iOS 14 property, but it is not marked as unavailable and as such compiles file for iOS 13, without throwing up a warning as other APIs would.
