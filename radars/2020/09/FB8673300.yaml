    description: "Upon migrating to tvOS 14, we noticed in our reference app that our UISwipeGestureRecognizer with up direction stopped working. After looking into it, it turned out that a gesture of private type “AVFocusTensionGestureRecognizer” somehow prevents our gesture recognizer from handling the swipes. The same works fine on all prior versions of tvOS.\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nXcode Version: 12.0 beta 6 (12A8189n)\r\ntvOS Version: 14.0 (18J5370e)\r\nApple TV Model: Apple TV 4K (at 1080p) Simulator\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Open a subclass AVPlayerViewController with a UISwipeGestureRecognizer attached to its root view\r\n2) Swipe up on the remote\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nTarget action is invoked\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nNothing happens"
