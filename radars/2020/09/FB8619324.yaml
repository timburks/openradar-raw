    description: "After installing previous three macOS betas, my internet has not worked on boot.\r\n\r\nThis time, turning Wi-Fi off, then on, resolved this issue. It appeared connected prior to turning it off.\r\n\r\nI collected a sysdiagnose before touching any settings after the first boot. I collected another sysdiagnose after resolving the issue."
