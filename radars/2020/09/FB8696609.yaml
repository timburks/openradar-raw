    description: "The keyboard appears black/empty after Passcode prompt for password auto-fill.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Turn off Face ID.\r\n2. Launch one of the apps: Butterfly iQ or My Verizon.\r\n3. Go to login screen.\r\n4. Tap one of the suggested logins on the keyboard. \r\n5. Passcode should be prompted: input it.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nPasscode screen goes away and keyboard shows as black/empty. Tapping the empty space triggers keyboard strokes. Going to a different screen and back doesn’t reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nYou can always see the keyboard when it’s up."
