    description: "There are many file storage apps like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive which supports file transfer.\r\n\r\nin iOS14 beta, When transferring a file using UIDocumentInteraction Controller, there is no \"Copy to..\" option. like \"Copy to Box\" or \"Copy to Dropbox\" etc.\r\n\r\nWhile the same works well in iOS13.\r\n\r\nPre steps -\r\n1. Install Box, Google Drive and Dropbox\r\n2. open your app and open any docx or pdf or any file\r\n3. Open UIDocumentInteraction Controller to transfer the file.\r\n4. No copy to Box, copy to dropbox option.\r\n\r\nCode which is executing -\r\n        fileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[NSTemporaryDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileName]];\r\n        _dic = [UIDocumentInteractionController interactionControllerWithURL:fileURL];\r\n        _dic.delegate = weakSelf;\r\n  \r\n        if (![_dic presentOpenInMenuFromRect:[button frame] inView:[button superview] animated:YES]) {\r\n              NSLog(@\"No apps available\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSame behaviour can be seen between Box, Dropbox and Drive internally.\r\nNOTE: this works in iOS13 but not in iOS14."
