    description: "Listbox role can own option role. According to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/listbox_role, if an option is not selectable, omit the aria-selected.\r\n\r\nHowever VoiceOver still narrates 'selected false' for DOM with role=option and no aria-selected attribute.\r\n\r\nExample to reproduce:\r\n1. With VoiceOver on, Navigate to my example in Chrome: https://0udrb.csb.app/\r\nThis is how I created my example, for reference:\r\n    1.1 Copy the HTML from Aria-example https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20170628/examples/listbox/listbox.html, under 'HTML Source Code' - 'Example 1: Single-Select Listbox'\r\n    1.2 Create a webpage using the copied code. Remove the 'aria-selected' attribute from the first 'li' node\r\n2. Navigate to the first 'li' node, VoiceOver narrates 'Leather seats not selected', even though it does not have 'aria-selected' attribute"
