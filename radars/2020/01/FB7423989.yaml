    description: "Text Selection creates area above UITextField which prevents text field activation [consumes touch events, so they are not reaching text field] â€“ responsible class is seems to be UIFieldEditor. It might stay on top of the UITextField, even after visual selection was dismissed (this can happen if we resign first responder for instance, or view controller will go through will-dismiss-appear cycle without being actually removed from navigation stack)\r\n\r\nUPD: resolved in iOS14 beta 5 and above"
