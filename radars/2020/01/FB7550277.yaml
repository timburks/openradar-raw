    description: "See the sample project and run the unit tests. The same test with one file succeeds and another file fails. \r\n\r\nIf you seek the item with the toleranceBefore and toleranceAfter version of the method, the completion closure never gets called. If you seek without those parameters, it always seeks to 0.\r\n\r\nThis wrong behavior only occurs if the AVPlayer instance is set in an AVPlayerLayer. If you comment out the creation of the AVPlayerLayer in AVItemController.swift:31, both tests will pass.\r\n\r\nOn files that work, it works as normal. I have reproduced this issue with 2 different files so far. I've included one bad file and one good file in the sample project."
