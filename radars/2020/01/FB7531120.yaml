    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen dismissing a presented UIViewController from an embed UITableView by selecting the cell without any animation(animated:false), I believe usually it causes under 50ms but sometimes(1~2 out of 10 times) it will cause more than 200ms so that user can feel the performance impact(an obvious delay). The testing project and the log is uploaded below.\r\n\r\nTest Environment:\r\n* macOS 10.14.6\r\n* iOS 12 & 13\r\n* Xcode 11.3(11C29)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: (from testing project)\r\n1. Run the app\r\n2. Tap 'Button' button\r\n3. Tap any cell from the presented UITableView(which is actually embed in a UIViewController)\r\n4. The presented UIViewController is dismissed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nin step 4, the UIViewController is dismissed within 50ms(as usual) every time and no obvious performance delay/lag(?) happens\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nin step 4, 1~2 out of 10 times(10%~20% chance) the UIViewController is dismissed by more than 200ms and user can feel an obvious performance delay/lag\r\n\r\n\r\nRef:\r\nthe testing project is below:\r\nhttps://github.com/inexcii/issue-dismiss-presented-tableview"
