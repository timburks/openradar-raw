Speak screen skip over WKWebView and starts reading the content of sibling views. It should finish reading WKWebView first before moving on to the other/sibling views/controls on the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\nIâ€™ve attached the project. Turn on the speak screen from iOS Settings -> Accessibility -> Spoken Content -> Speak Screen. Launch the app from the attached Xcode project. After running the app, swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen to hear the content of the screen.\r\n\r\nGit repository to reproduce this bug: https://github.com/Flipboard/SpeakScreen\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nIt should read the whole content of the WKWebView first and then read the label at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\nIt reads very little content (heading etc) of the WKWebView and then quickly jumps to reading the label at the bottom of the screen. Then it stops."
