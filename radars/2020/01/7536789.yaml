    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen implementing reordering using the CollectionView’s reordering API a cell snaps to its original position when is being dragged near by it, without the intention to drop it. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement reordering using the CollectionView’s collectionView(_:moveItemAt:destinationIndexPath:) method, and the rest of the reordering API such as implement the gesture handling.\r\n\r\n2. Long press on a cell.\r\n\r\n3. Drag the cell.\r\n\r\n4. Keep dragging the cell back and forth, and drag it thru its original position.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cell should go thru its original position just as it behaves when its being dragged thru the other positions.\r\n\r\nThis should behave as when we implement reordering using the Drag and Drop APIs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cell snaps to its original position even when you did not intended to drop it.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nImplement reordering using the Drag and Drop API.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 11.3 (11C29)\r\niOS: iOS 13.3\r\n\r\nDemo and project reproducing the issue: https://github.com/JhonnyBillM/file-a-radar/tree/master/FB7536789%20-%20Sticky%20cells%20when%20reordering"
