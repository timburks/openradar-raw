    description: It would be highly beneficial if AVAssetWriter were able to produce a fragmented MP4 (fMP4). This currently seems to be utilized when `movieFragmentInterval` is set. However, in the current implementation, the file loses its `moof` atoms upon calling finishWritingWithCompletionHandler.
