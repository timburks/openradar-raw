    description: "Given that XCTFail immediately throws an error, it should return `Never` to let the compiler know that this is going to happen.\r\n\r\nOften when writing tests, we need to write helper functions like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct Type {\r\n    let foo: String\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc makeType(foo: String) -> Type {\r\n    guard !foo.isEmpty else {\r\n        XCTFail(\"An empty string was passed in for foo\")\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return Type(foo: foo)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause XCTFail _doesn't_ return `Never`, we get a compiler error that the guard will fall through without a return statement. However, it's not actually appropriate to return anything here. We can modify the code to return an Optional, but in some cases that simply isn't appropriate.\r\n\r\nHaving XCTFail return `Never` will give our code clearer intention and allow us to communicate that intention to the compiler."
