    description: "The current content blocker API fails to compile a list if you attempt to have a list that contains both the `if-domain` and `if-top-url` (or `unless-domain` and `unless-top-url`) url triggers, even if said triggers are not in the same rule.  For example, this list will fail to compile:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"trigger\": {\r\n        \"url-filter\": \".*\",\r\n        \"resource-type\": [\"image\", \"style-sheet\"],\r\n        \"unless-domain\": [\"foo.com\", \"bar.com\"]\r\n    },\r\n    \"action\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"block\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"trigger\": {\r\n        \"url-filter\": \".*\",\r\n        \"resource-type\": [\"script\"],\r\n        \"unless-top-url\": \"baz.com\",\r\n    },\r\n    \"action\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"block\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two rules are completely unrelated to each other, but WebKit will fail to compile this list because of the usage of both `unless-domain` and `unless-top-url` in the same file\r\n\r\nThis limitation isn't specified in the documentation around these triggers. The only thing the documentation specifies is that you cannot use `if-domain` and `unless-domain`, or `if-top-url` and `unless-top-url` in the same rule. \r\n\r\nI think the expected result is that these rules should be allowed to co-exist in the same list"
