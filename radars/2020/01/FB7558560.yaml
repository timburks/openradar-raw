    description: "Xcode crashes when I change a table view cell's style in a storyboard. It defaulted to custom when I first added it. Then I changed it to right detail without issue. Now I am trying to change it back to custom or any other style but it crashes immediately 100% of the time\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation this seems to happen when you set the \"image\" property in the storyboard for the right detail cell (or subtitle or basic cell). Even if you subsequently delete the image property contents, it will still crash if you switch the type to Custom or Left Detail which don't have an \"Image\" field"
