    description: "With the launch of iOS 13, iOS and iPadOS gained the ability to connect and utilise the Xbox One S Bluetooth controllers. Shortly after iOS 13's release, Microsoft released a variant of this controller called the Xbox One Elite Series 2 (Model 1797).\r\n\r\nAt present, trying to pair one of these controllers to either iPadOS or iOS fails, in that the controller will never appear on the list of available devices in the Bluetooth menu in settings.\r\n\r\nOne would reasonably assume that the controller needs to be whitelisted by Apple before iOS and iPadOS devices will detect it. Please consider adding this to a future version of iOS and iPadOS."
