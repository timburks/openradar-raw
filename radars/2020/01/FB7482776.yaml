    description: "1. Create a UILabel with the default values (`lineBreakBehavior` is still `.byTruncatingTail`, `numberOfLines` is still `1`) and some very long text, like `\"Very Very Very Very Very Very Very Very Very Very Text\"`.\r\n2. Call `sizeThatFits` on the label with a width of 250 and a height of 100\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior: The size that fits should have a width of 250 or less because the label should know to truncate the text since it's too long.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior: The size that is returned is over 400, well over the size that was passed in to `sizeThatFits`\r\n\r\nI have attached a playground that demonstrates this. In the playground, you'll see that if you set `numberOfLines` to `2` and set content that extends past 2 lines of content, everything works correctly. It is only for `numberOfLines` set to `1` that truncation is broken.\r\n\r\nXcode Version: 11.2.1"
