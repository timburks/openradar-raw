    description: "This feedback is regarding the behavior of vertically-scrolling ScrollViews when contained within a NavigationView in SwiftUI.\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple vertically-scrolling ScrollViews contained with a given NavigationView ancestor, only one of them triggers the logic that allows the NavigationView’s associated navigation bar to appear and “blur” the content of the ScrollView as it slides underneath. In my testing this appears to be the last ScrollView in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the following structure:\r\n\r\nNavigationView {\r\n\tHStack {\r\n\t\tScrollView {\r\n\t\t\t// … ScrollView A content goes here\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tScrollView {\r\n\t\t\t// … ScrollView B content goes here\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf you scroll the content of “ScrollView A” up, it will simply appear over the NavigationView. The navigation bar won’t appear and the content one would expect to go underneath it (with a blur effect) does not do so. Scrolling the content of “ScrollView B” works as expected.\r\n\r\nThere are scenarios wherein one might want to have two vertically-scrolling ScrollViews with content that interacts as expected with a containing NavigationView.\r\n\r\nYou can sort of work around this by adding the .clipped() modifier to the non-working ScrollView, but only prevents it from overlapping the navigation bar. It does not allow the blur effect to work any longer.\r\n\r\nI have verified this behavior both on iPhone and iPad.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample Xcode project demonstrating this behavior, as well as 2 iPad screenshots showing what happens when you scroll up with either the first ScrollView or the second ScrollView. You’ll notice that the second ScrollView works properly."
