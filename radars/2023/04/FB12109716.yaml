    description: "When using a font with ligatures in an NSTextView, it is expected to be able to enable or disable ligatures and modify the line height at the same time. To disable ligatures, the documentation says to set the `.ligature` attribute on an `NSAttributedString` to 0. This works, until one sets both the `.paragraphStyle` and `.baselineOffset` modifiers on the attributed string. When all three attributes are set the ligature attribute is always enabled. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce: \r\n- Create an NSTextView \r\n- Add a font that makes use of ligatures (the provided example bundles an open-source font with ligatures) \r\n- Using `textView.textStorage?.setAttributes`, set the `.ligature` attribute to 0 (disabling ligatures) \r\n- Notice that ligatures are disabled. \r\n- Add two new attributes in the same function call: `.baselineOffset` and `.paragraphStyle`. The paragraph style should have either `.lineHeightMultiple` or `lineSpacing` modified. \r\n- Re-run the application, noting that ligatures are now *enabled*. Despite still setting the ligature attribute to 0. \r\n\r\nThe provided Xcode project bundles a font with ligatures and displays this behavior using a button that toggles the line height modifiers. To run, simply open the project in Xcode and run the application. There will be a button on the top of the view that disables and enables line height modifiers. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior: \r\nLigatures should stay disabled when adding other attributes like baselineOffset and paragraph styles. \r\n\r\nActual behavior: \r\nLigature settings are overridden when adding the previously mentioned attributes at the same time. \r\n\r\n> OS: Ventura 13.2 \r\n> Machine: 14-inch, 2021 MacBook Pro \r\n> Chip: Apple M1 Pro \r\n> The font provided is open-source and okay for distribution, license here: https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/blob/master/LICENSE"
