    description: 'Using NavigationView with NavigationLink and popping back more than one screen in one state update causes the following error to be printed to the console: NavigationLink presenting a value must appear inside a NavigationContent-based NavigationView. Link will be disabled. Reproduction steps: - Open attached project zip file. - Launch app on iOS 16. - Tap Go to push screen 2. - Tap Go to push screen 3. - Tap Pop to root to pop both screens. - Observe logged warning in console. Expected: The app should pop to the root screen without logging an error. Observed; The app pops to the root as expected, but logs an error: NavigationLink presenting a value must appear inside a NavigationContent-based NavigationView. Link will be disabled. The error should not be logged as all NavigationLinks in the project are nested properly within NavigationView, and the error is confusing as none of the NavigationLinks is presenting a value (they are using the older API for pushing a view based on a binding instead). The error seems to be triggered by the NavigationLink on the third screen, as removing it prevents the error being logged.'
