    description: "I noticed this problem when using AVPlayer directly, but I reproduced it with AVPlayerViewController in the attached sample project for simplicity. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Launch the app on device and hit play to let the video play out to the end frame which is a solid white color. 2. Lock the screen of the device and wait about 20 seconds. \r\n3. Unlock the phone, and notice that the video is now displaying a solid black frame which is a few frames before the solid white color end frame.\r\n\r\n This appears to be due to the video asset having a fractional duration, so it appears that unwanted rounding is occurring in this logic that runs in an AVPlayer in an app that is resigned inactive.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9nt93vczbarovtc/StockAVPlayerViewController.zip?dl=0"
