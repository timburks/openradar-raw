    description: "Noticed on iPhone 13 Pro Max, on iOS 16.3.1: \r\n\r\nWhen the viewport is oriented in landscape, in the Calendar app, non-visible controls in the toolbars region of the screen can be swiped to and will announce their semantics in VoiceOver. The controls are not accessible when using other modes of interaction (that is, with VO off). \r\n\r\nOur company's developers have seen this behavior, generally, when using \"present\" to display a view modally, on iOS 16.x in landscape orientation: VO is able to access content that is below the modal view. Note that this does not happen when developers use \"push\" to display the view (which creates a new view rather than a modal window within the current view). \r\n\r\nNon-visible controls begin being announced in the Calendar app around the 40 second mark in the following video: \r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16NAmlaNdQH9B6Bx8TskbSAkOGdFq5ZJp/view?usp=share_link"
