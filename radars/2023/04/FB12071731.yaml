    description: "If the OSLogEnumerator returned by [OSLogStore entriesEnumeratorWithOptions:position:predicate:error:] is released before it is fully enumerated either via repeated nextObject calls till it returns nil or calling allObjects on it then it will not be closed/freed properly, and the underlying used com.apple.loggingsupport.stream dispatch queue will leave behind a working thread (waiting for a semaphore) that also holds all the already allocated memory for each released enumerators.\r\n\r\nIf the enumerator fully iterated all of the log objects the issue is not happening."
