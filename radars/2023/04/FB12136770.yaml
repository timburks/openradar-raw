Delete your app from the device.\r\n2. Turn the device off completely and turn it back on.\r\n3. Go to Settings > General > Date & Time and set the date ahead a day or more.\r\n4. Turn the device off completely again and turn it back on.\r\n\r\nThis requires two device restarts and 2 trips to the Settings app (one to set the date forward and another to set it back).\r\n\r\nThis is pretty tedious when designing a push notification UX flow.\r\n\r\nIt would be greatly beneficial to be able to manually reset this from within the Settings app without requiring any restarts or changing the date in Settings."
