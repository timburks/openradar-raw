    description: "SwiftUI views that are displayed in collection views (including via List) are expected to be “selected” when using Voice Over and activating the view’s default action. This works as expected, unless the view contains a Button with a certain type of label view.\r\n\r\nIf the view displayed in the List row / collection view cell contains a Button that has an Image label with an image sourced from app’s XCAssets, then the default accessibility action will cause the button to be activated, rather than cause the cell to be selected.\r\n\r\nUsing a Text label or an Image label with an image sourced from the system (SF symbols) images causes the default Voice Over action to select the cell, which is the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nSee the attached example project for a repro case.\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1OfnfZFhnqgHK9MzjW5HJYRqxVpwpUyvG/view?usp=sharing"
