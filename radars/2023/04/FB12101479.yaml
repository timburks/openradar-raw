    description: "When using VoiceOver in Safari, VO treats HTML elements that become inaccessible (by making them display:none) as still being present. \r\n\r\nTheir textual content is not announced, but they are still in the VO swipe order. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\nGo to https://butterpep.com/menu-select-example.html \r\nTurn on VoiceOver \r\nSwipe to the button with aria-haspopup=\"menu\" and aria-expanded=\"false\" (\"choose an animal...\") \r\nDouble-tap to expand the menu \r\nSwipe right until you leave the menu and land on the button below it, named \"button that does nothing\" \r\nWhen you swipe to this button, a blur event will remove the menu visually and mark the menu as display:none \r\nWhen the menu is removed visually, swipe left, back up to the \"choose an animal...\" button. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior: \r\nOnly what is visually apparent on the screen is a swipe stop. \r\n\r\nActual behavior: \r\nThe (empty) nodes that were traversed when moving down/forward through the menu are still encountered when moving up/backward, after the menu is no longer visually apparent and is technically inaccessible. \r\nThe nodes are \"empty\" swipe stops, containing no text. \r\n\r\nThis behavior does not occur in any other screen reader/browser combination on Mac, Android, or Windows. This behavior was observed on iOS 15.7.4 and 16.3.1 on multiple iOS devices."
