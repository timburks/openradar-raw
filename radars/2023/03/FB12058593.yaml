    description: "In our app we have a scenario where we'd like to add accessibility information to a view that has the redacted modifier called on it. Here's a simplified example: \r\n\r\nButton(\"Title\", action: { })\r\n .redacted(reason: .placeholder)\r\n .accessibilityLabel(\"Loading State\") \r\n\r\nHowever, the redacted modifier will obscure the accessibility label from Voice Over. This requires us to define a custom accessibility element to override the redacted view's behavior, but then we lose the traits of the original view (the button in this case)."
