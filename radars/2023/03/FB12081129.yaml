    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/transaction/disablesanimations\r\n\r\nThe docs for disablesAnimation states \"A Boolean value that indicates whether views should disable animations.\" I'd like to suggest it either states what Views it works on or the ones it does not work on. Since just now it takes a lot of trial and error to find out. For Views like NavigationStack it should also say if it works for both push and pop animations."
