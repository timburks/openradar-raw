    description: In our application we allow views to be set into an error state through an environment modifier. We'd like an easy to make this error state accessible. It'd be ideal if we could define a custom AccessibilityTrait for this that way we can appropriate add or remove the error state trait at the appropriate level in the view hierarchy. This is particularly necessary when we're combining the children of an accessibility element, because we want the error trait to always be included in the final VoiceOver read out.
