    description: "# Details\r\n## What does the Finder issue you are seeing involve?\r\nFile actions\r\n\r\n## What does the file action involve?\r\nMoving files\r\n\r\n## What does the problem with the file action involve?\r\nFunctionality\r\n\r\n## Are you able to collect a screenshot or screen recording that shows the issue? If so, please attach it to this report.\r\nYes\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n## Please describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nAfter renaming a folder, I'm unable to open the files inside it. Finder fails with an error: \"<filename>\" can't be found.\r\n\r\nReproducible steps:\r\n1. Open Finder in columns view\r\n2. Locate any folder that contains files\r\n3. Rename folder\r\n4. Try to access any file inside that renamed folder\r\n\r\nIt's also very important where you \"click\" since the issue can't be reproduced if you somehow bring Finder to \"refresh\" its state (at least that's what I assume). Just make sure to follow the steps exactly as shown in the attached screen recording.\r\n\r\nI'm using the latest stable version of macOS 13.2.1 (22D68) and was able to reproduce this error on at least 3 different Macs."
