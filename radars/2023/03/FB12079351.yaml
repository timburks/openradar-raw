    description: "Different iOS apps are crashing spontaneously if users are typing in UITextField using a 3rd party keyboards. There are no clear steps how to reproduce this crash, but it is happening frequently if:\r\n1. A 3rd party screen keyboard with full access is in use;\r\n2. User tapped on UITextField;\r\n3. User is typing quickly, making double-taps on a text field, selecting predictions.\r\n\r\nThe following workaround is fixing this crash: https://github.com/SnowGirls/Objc-Deallocating/blob/95fdd6f5525988c09343040654a1d8a1c0402925/Objc-Deallocating/UITouch%2BFixCrashOnInputKeyboard.m . However, it uses some private APIs from UIKit. Hence, there is a chance that usage of these APIs might be flagged during the App review process."
