    description: "AVAudioPlayerNode has the ability to play multiple instances in sync by using play(at: AVAudioTime).\r\n\r\nThis is great, but there is no easy way to pause and resume all the players in sync.\r\n\r\nWe propose to add pause(at: AVAudioTime) method to AVAudioPlayerNode so that all players can be paused at the same point in time."
