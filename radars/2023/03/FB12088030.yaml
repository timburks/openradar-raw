    description: "This issue happen only with Swift XCFrameworks created following this documentation\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-multi-platform-binary-framework-bundle\r\n\r\nOnce you include that framework in your project, autocomplete shows the API documentation for every documented method or property, but the Quick Help menu do not show anything (see attachment)\r\n\r\nComparing with other XCFrameworks, with Objective-C code, I can see that works correctly, but not for Swift frameworks."
