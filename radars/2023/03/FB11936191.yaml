    description: "**Please describe the issue:**\r\n\r\nWhen you have a view hierarchy like this:\r\n\r\nTabView\r\n     -> NavigationStack\r\n          -> ViewOne\r\n\r\nUsing NavigationStack to pop a view onto the navigation stack results in that view having have its @StateObjects initialized twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:**\r\n1. Download the attached sample project\r\n2. Run the app and tap on the label that says “View One”. After you will see this output in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nView Two Initialized\r\nViewModel initialized..\r\nViewModel reinitialized..\r\nView Two Initialized\r\nViewModel initialized..\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Go to TestApp.swift and comment out lines 14 and 17 (removing the Tab View)\r\n4. Rerun the app and tap the label that says “View One” again and you will see this printed to the console:\r\n```\r\nView Two Initialized\r\nView Two Initialized\r\nViewModel initialized..\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\nThe @StateObject property, foo should have only been initialized once even when a NavigationStack is nested in a TabView\r\n\r\n**What actually happened?**\r\nThe @StateObject property, foo was initialized, de-initialized and then reinitialized in quick succession\r\n\r\nNote: a sample project was included in the initial feedback but Open Radar doesn't allow file uploads. If you are curious, you can find the sample project here: https://github.com/Lontronix/FB11936191"
