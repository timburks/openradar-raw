    description: "################### Description ######################### \r\nWhenever my Macbook uses a lot of memory, the speakers will start to make popping/crackling noises... It can happen at any given time but it's crucial to state that it only happens when the 'memory pressure' shown in Activity Monitor gets yellow. It's a known issue amongst macbook owners with silicon chip. Some suggest that the issue is caused by the connection between the darwin scheduler and how it interacts with coreaudiohd. \r\n\r\n##################################### \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n1. Get the 'memory pressure' state into yellow \r\n2. Put some music on and set the output to be the macbook speaker. \r\n3. Listen for 1-15 min, speaker volume does not seem to change the output. \r\n4. Popping or crack noises should occur multiple times while listening. \r\n\r\nExpected result: Being able to broadcast music to the speaker with no popping noises \r\n\r\nActual result: Broadcasting music to the speaker, results in popping noises, as soon as the 'memory pressure' goes into yellow state. \r\n\r\nWhile I'm experiencing this on MacOS 12.6.1, I can also confirm that it's still happening in MacOS Ventura through colleagues."
