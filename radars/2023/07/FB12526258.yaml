    description: "Please provide an API for writing and reading the State Of Mind entries in HealthKit. Many mindfulness apps have been enabling users to log their moods, including our own app stoic.\r\n\r\nWith the ability to feed HealthKit with mood data, users can integrate their existing workflows that they have already set up in other app and potentially import historical mood data that they have been gathering for years. \r\n\r\nWe believe HealthKit presents a great opportunity for everyone (Apple, 3rd party developers, users) to have great experience on the platform.\r\n\r\nJust as every modern fitness app is expected to have good HealthKit integration, the same should apply to mindfulness apps, and adding State of Mind APIs is essential to achieve this goal."
