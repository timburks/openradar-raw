    description: "Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple app with a button to open a sheet and a toolbar item that opens a menu.\r\n2. Run the app and tap the toolbar item to open the (context) menu.\r\n3. Without actively closing the menu, tap the other button in the background that normally triggers the presentation of a sheet. \r\n\r\nExpected Result: \r\nEither\r\n1. The menu is dismissed and the sheet opens. \r\nor \r\n2. A tap on the background simply closes the menu, so I can open the sheet on a second tap. \r\n\r\nObserved Result: \r\nThe menu closes automatically, but no sheet is shown. When I repeatedly tap the button to open the sheet afterwards, nothing happens. So from that moment on, the app is basically broken and the button doesn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nOn the first button tap, the following warning is printed to the console: \r\n> [Presentation] Attempt to present <TtGC7SwiftUI29PresentationHostingControllerVS_7AnyView: 0x105818200> on <TtGC7SwiftUI19UIHostingControllerGVS_15ModifiedContentVS_7AnyViewVS_12RootModifier_: 0x10601e000> (from <TtGC7SwiftUI19UIHostingControllerGVS_15ModifiedContentVS_7AnyViewVS_12RootModifier_: 0x10601e000>) which is already presenting <_UIContextMenuActionsOnlyViewController: 0x107308e30>. \r\n\r\nI've also posted a full bug description on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/q/76766665/2062785\r\n\r\nI've also attached a minimal example in a sample project. The bug only occurs on real devices (tested with iPhone 13 Pro, iOS 16.5.1)! Simulator works as expected. Thank you for fixing this!"
