    description: "In iOS 15, the “Get Current IP Address” would return no value if there was no Internet connection, whether Internal or External address was selected. In iOS 16, the action times out with “Unknown Host,” if External is selected, and returns an IP address if Local is selected, making it impossible to use this action to determine whether there is Internet connectivity. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n1. Create a Shortcut with a “Get Current IP Address” action, with “External” address selected. \r\n2. Turn on Airplane Mode. \r\n3. Run the shortcut \r\n\r\nExpected result: Nothing. \r\n\r\nActual result: The action times out with an “Unknown host” error."
