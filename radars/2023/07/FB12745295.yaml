    description: "Starting the project as a volumetric initial scene and mixed immersive space. I want to start with an ImmersiveSpace as the first scene. I’ve properly commented out the WindowGroup in the App file with the volume and only having the ImmersiveSpace as the first scene. Properly changing the Info.plist to use the UISceneSessionRoleImmersiveSpaceApplication.\r\n\r\nNow when the app is launched nothing is shown! In Reality Composer Pro, I moved the two spheres to be closer to the ground (0) and at -10cm Z axis. The sphere are now being shown, because initially I think they were being clipped out of frame. But I also observed the whole Immersive space now acting as a volume as opposed to being an immersive space that doesn’t move."
