    description: "I'm seeing some weird behaviour with the fileImporter modifier on my iOS app. When running this View code on an iPhone running iOS >= 16, it runs fine, the document picker presents itself and passes back the result, no issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct SomeView: View {\r\n    @State private var importingFile = false\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        List {\r\n            Section(header: Text(\"Header\"), footer: Text(\"Footer\") {\r\n                Text(\"Tap to open\")\r\n                .onTapGesture {\r\n                    importingFile = true\r\n                }.fileImporter(isPresented: $importingFile, allowedContentTypes: [.pdf]) { result in\r\n                    didImportFile(withResult: result)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func didImportFile(withResult result: Result<URL, Error>) {\r\n        print(\"Do something with result\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when running on iOS 15 (possibly 14, unable to test at the moment), wherein, nothing happens at all. No document picker is presented.\r\n\r\nLooking at the official documentation here https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/fileimporter(ispresented:allowedcontenttypes:allowsmultipleselection:oncompletion:), this API is marked as iOS 14 compatible and I'm definitely not adding an #if available checks so I know it's not an api compatibility issue."
