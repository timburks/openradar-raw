    description: 'Hi, our app build suddenly got rejected: ITMS-90338: Non-public API usage - The app references non-public symbols in Frameworks/AmazonIVSPlayer.framework/AmazonIVSPlayer: _CMTimebaseCreateWithMasterClock. If method names in your source code match the private Apple APIs listed above, altering your method names will help prevent this app from being flagged in future submissions. In addition, note that one or more of the above APIs may be located in a static library that was included with your app. If so, they must be removed. For further information, visit the Technical Support Information at http://developer.apple.com/support/technical/ Our build''s yesterday at 0 AM GMT+0 is still passing the automatic review, but our build at 3 AM GMT+0 got this error. Our build both includes AmazonIVSPlayer.framework, but somehow got treated differently. Is there any change of rule from Apple side? I have submitted this on Apple Developer Forum, and many got the same issue: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/733318'
