    description: "In the iOS 17 simulator, when a UITextField has a custom keypad (non-nil inputView) and resigns first responder, all of the input view's contents are replaced by solid gray for the duration of the dismissal animation. This can be reproduced on an iOS 17 simulator as installed by Xcode 15 beta 4 (Simulator 15.0 (1009)), no matter whether the app was compiled with Xcode 14.3.1 or Xcode 15 beta 4. It can neither be reproduced on an iOS 16.4 simulator, nor on an iPhone 12 Pro running iOS 16.5.1 (c). I unfortunately can't test on a phone running iOS 17 because I don't have a spare right now. I've attached both a screen recording showing the behavior, and a very simple demo.\r\n\r\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\r\n    @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n\r\n        let keypad = UIInputView(\r\n            frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.frame.width, height: 250),\r\n            inputViewStyle: .keyboard\r\n        )\r\n        keypad.backgroundColor = .systemBlue\r\n        textField.inputView = keypad\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @IBAction func onDismiss(_ sender: UIButton) {\r\n        textField.resignFirstResponder()\r\n    }\r\n}"
