    description: "If when an app is opened, a window is minimized, then view controllers in this window won't get *any* view apparition callbacks, such as viewWillAppear. Not when the app is opened; not when the window is un-minimized; not even when the app is then hidden then shown.\r\n\r\nThis behavior happens reliably on my machine, but on a friend's, it requires opening multiple tabs in a single window.\r\nIt seems to occur more reliably in document-based apps.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n- In System Settings, make sure “Close windows when quitting an application” is disabled.\r\n- In Xcode, create a new document-based app, using Storyboards and Swift\r\n- In the view controller, add a `viewWillAppear` method with a `print` call, to keep track of when the method is called.\r\n- Now run the app. Minimize the document window that got opened.\r\n- Quit and relaunch the app.\r\n- Notice that `viewWillAppear` doesn't get called at all for the restored window, no matter what you do."
