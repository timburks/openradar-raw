    description: I have a `List` use case that requires rows to be nonselectable when edit mode is inactive but allows for multiple selection when edit mode is active. I have attached a sample project demonstrating this use case. In the sample project, I pass the selection binding to the `List` only if edit mode is active; otherwise, I pass `nil` to the `List`â€™s `selection` parameter. This triggers a bug in SwiftUI where the `List` no longer shows its multi-select checkmarks when edit mode is active.
