    description: "I have attached a sample project that tries to use `MusicDataRequest.tokenProvider` to request a token. It results in a compiler warning.\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant code:\r\n```\r\nprivate func requestDeveloperToken() async throws -> String {\r\n  return try await MusicDataRequest.tokenProvider.developerToken(options: [])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter setting the “Strict Concurrency Checking” Xcode build setting to “Complete”, the compiler produces the following warning:\r\n> Reference to static property 'tokenProvider' is not concurrency-safe because it involves shared mutable state\r\n\r\nIndeed, MusicKit defines `tokenProvider` as a mutable static property. Perhaps it should be made immutable?"
