    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/add_a_resource_to_a_library\r\n\r\nThe Apple Music API documentation for the add to library request does not specify how many catalog IDs can be sent per request. Moreover, the server itself does not seem to have a clear maximum. The practical maximum seems to be related to the length of the URL. Instead, the maximum should be documented (and enforced) so that developers do not have to make assumptions."
