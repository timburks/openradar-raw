    description: "There seems to be a bug in macOS 14 (14-14.1.2) that causes VPN connections to regularly disconnect after 24 or 48 minutes, causing a short network interrupt for 1-2 seconds. Prior macOS versions up to 13 do not have the issue. Release notes do not mention any breaking changes for 14, or 14.1. We have found that macOS sends an invalid proposal list on rekey, particularly for connections with OnDemand enabled.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Libreswan community, we've discussed it at libreswan/libreswan#1450. It is manifesting across developer products, e.g. IPSecVPN hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn#1486, Docker docker/for-mac#7022, and VPN Providers https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255158874.\r\n\r\nThe bug seems to be somewhere in the rekey/cert/proposal process. With a test server running libreswan 4.12 set to match the default security params from apple dev docs ikesecurityassociationparameters and childsecurityassociationparameters. To reproduce: - Start a vpn server with no rekey or rekey interval longer than 48 minutes, allowing macos to initiate the rekey - Load a vpn profile on macos with on-demand enabled - Connect, watch the server for incorrect proposal chosen, or wait 24-48 minute for a rekey, watch for disconnect/reconnect Feel free to contact me for help resolving the issue."
