    description: "I have attached a sample project that contains a custom `MusicItem` type. One might create a custom `MusicItem` type to represent a data type in the Apple Music server API that does not exist in MusicKit.\r\n\r\nMany Apple Music server responses consist of a collection of items. MusicKit offers a generic `MusicItemCollection` type with which one can decode server responses.\r\n\r\nThe issue that the sample project demonstrates is that `MusicItemCollection` does not propagate decode errors thrown by the `MusicItem` type. Instead, it logs the error and then drops the error. This prevents developers from customizing the error handling. Instead, `MusicItemCollection` should propagate the error and let the developer decide what to do with it."
