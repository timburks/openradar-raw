    description: "I have attached a sample project demonstrating a `NavigationSplitView` with a `List` of `NavigationLink`s in its sidebar. Sometimes, the selection is updated incorrectly.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\n1. Select the first of the two items.\r\n2. Click the Add Item button.\r\n\r\nExpected result: The second of the three items is selected.\r\n\r\nActual result: The third of the three items is selected.\r\n\r\nThe issue only occurs on macOS and only when using `NavigationLink`. (Even though `NavigationSplitView` still works without the `NavigationLink`, the `NavigationLink` is needed to show the chevron in compact mode, as on iPhone.)"
