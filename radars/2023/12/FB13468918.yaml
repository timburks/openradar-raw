    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/libraryplaylistcreationrequest/relationships\r\n\r\nI am looking at the Apple Music API documentation for creating a playlist. The `LibraryPlaylistCreationRequest.Relationships.parent` property is marked “Required” but it is actually optional. When the property is not specified, the playlist is created at the root of the library."
