    description: "Developers may want to pass a `Logger` across concurrency domains. For example, creating a `Logger` instance and using the same instance in a bunch of concurrent child tasks.\r\n\r\nI am guessing that `Logger` is already concurrency-safe. However, it is not currently marked `Sendable`. Please mark it `Sendable`!"
