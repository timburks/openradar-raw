    description: "I have attached a sample project that contains a `ProgressView` that is backed by a `Progress` object. When `Progress.isIndeterminate` changes, the `ProgressView` updates its subviews and layout accordingly. However, the update is not animated—even if I wrap the change in a `withAnimation` block.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the update should always be animated—even outside of a `withAnimation` block—since `Progress` changes could come from a lower layer of the app that might know nothing about SwiftUI (e.g. a package outside of our control)."
