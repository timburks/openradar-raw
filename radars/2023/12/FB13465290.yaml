    description: "I've got the following command to run on every macOS start:\r\n\r\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\": [{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 0x700000064, \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 0x700000035}]}'\r\n\r\nIt always rebinds a key (non_us_backslash to grave_accent_and_tilde) on my international Apple Magic Keyboard to a convenient one to match with my us keyboard laptop.\r\n\r\nRight after 14.2 install this command stopped working. It throws no error, the hidutil property --get UserKeyMapping prints out some kind a valid output as follow, but the key behaviour isn't updates after the command run as it appears before update. Also I'm not sure that in the past the --get argument output was printed out as a Decimal rather than hex. But this is as it is now.\r\n\r\nThe command output:\r\n\r\n(\r\n    {\r\n        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771125;\r\n        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771172;\r\n    }\r\n)"
