    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/group\r\n\r\nThe documentation says\r\n> The modifier applies to all members of the group — and not to the group itself. For example, if you apply `onAppear(perform:)` to the above group, it applies to all of the views produced by the `if isLoggedIn` conditional, and it executes every time `isLoggedIn` changes.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project with a similar `Group` definition. The “Appeared!” message is only ever logged once—even when the `if` condition changes. Is this a bug or is the documentation incorrect?"
