    description: "I have attached a sample project demonstrating a batch Add To Library request:\r\n```\r\nhttps://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library?ids[songs]=1675379749,348906128,…\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tracks are added in a random order. I expected the tracks to be added in the order that I specified.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure if there is an issue with the server endpoint but what I have found is that Apple Music only has second-level timestamp precision, which means it is very easy for batch-added tracks to have the same timestamp, causing issues with the ordering of batch-added tracks. I have worked around this by adding a one second delay in between single-item Add To Library requests.\r\n\r\nIdeally, Apple Music would be able to respect the order I specified in the Add To Library request."
