But List and NSScrollView works just fine.\r\n\r\nYou can use the attached project to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Archive the Scroll target, move it to the applications folder.\r\n2. Copy the com.intii.example.mach.service.name.plist to ~/Library/LaunchAgents and set it up in the correct way.\r\n3. Run the launcher target to launch the Scroll.app with the launch agent.\r\n\r\nThe app contains a ScrollView, List, and NSScrollView, you should find that the ScrollView is very laggy.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intitni/reproduce-scrollview-issue"
