    description: "Dear Apple Feedback Team:\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a persistent issue with third-party app background processes on iOS devices, particularly with large file transfers.\r\n\r\n**Problem Statement:**\r\nUsers often experience interruptions when transferring large files, such as 4K videos, via third-party messaging apps like Telegram and WhatsApp. When an iPhone locks or the screen turns off, these file transfers frequently fail to complete, which is not the case on devices from your competitors.\r\n\r\n**Comparison:**\r\nIt's notable that smartphones retailing at a fraction of an iPhone's price can manage these tasks without user intervention. It seems incongruous that a premium device encounters such basic operational challenges.\r\n\r\n**User Experience:**\r\nCurrently, users must resort to impractical workarounds, such as constantly tapping the screen or altering device settings to prevent automatic locking. This is not only inconvenient but also detracts from the seamless experience that Apple products are known for.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\nI propose a two-part solution to enhance the iOS experience:\r\n- Introduce a new system permission for 'large background file transfers', allowing apps to request authorization for this specific function.\r\n- Implement an interactive UI feature, possibly through the Dynamic Island, which not only informs users of ongoing background file transfers but also provides options to pause or cancel them.\r\n\r\nThis approach could mirror the existing system controls for music playback, offering both visibility and control over background activities without compromising security or user autonomy.\r\n\r\n**Closing:**\r\nI trust that Apple values user feedback and is committed to refining the iOS experience. I believe that implementing these suggestions would significantly improve functionality and user satisfaction. I am looking forward to your thoughts on this matter.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nKind regards and happy holidays."
