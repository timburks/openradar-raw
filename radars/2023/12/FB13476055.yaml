    description: "As a streaming platform we would greatly appreciate if MetricKit was supported on tvOS too. Currently, it's the only non-wearable platform lacking support, even as visionOS prepares to offer it. Without MetricKit, we can't use hang rate and hitch ratio as industry standards. This forces us to create our own tools for collecting performance metrics on tvOS.\r\n\r\nSupport for Xcode Organizer and App Store Connect goes along with it.\r\n\r\nWritten at a time of Xcode 15.1, iOS 17.2 and tvOS 17.2."
