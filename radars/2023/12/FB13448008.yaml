    description: "I have attached a sample project demonstrating a bidirectional relationship. The `Track` model has a `[TrackToPlaylistRelationship]` property. The `TrackToPlaylistRelationship` model has a `Track` property. The `TrackToPlaylistRelationship` model sets its `Track` property during initialization. Unexpectedly, the initializer does not update the other side of the relationship.\r\n\r\nI have annotated `TrackToPlaylistRelationship.swift` and `ContentView.swift` with comments that may be helpful for understanding and investigating this issue."
