    description: "When using TextField with the `lineSpacing(_:)` and `lineLimit(_:reservesSpace:)` modifiers and setting the `reservesSpace` argument to `true` the height of the vertical TextField does not calculate correctly.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the code snippet has the number of lines set to `5` and the `reservesSpace` argument is set to `true`. The expected behaviour here would be that the TextField would be sized to accommodate 5 lines of text. Instead, the TextFIeld only accommodates 2.5 lines of text.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTextField(\"\", text: $text, axis: .vertical)\r\n    .font(.headline)\r\n    .lineSpacing(25)\r\n    .lineLimit(5, reservesSpace: true)\r\n    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)\r\n```\r\n\r\nItâ€™s also worth noting which can be seen in the video, that the initial text insertion cursor is massively oversized until you start typing.\r\n\r\nAttached is a playground file demonstrating the issue and a video recording."
