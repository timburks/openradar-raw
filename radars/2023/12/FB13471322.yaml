    description: "The Create Library Playlist request is currently not idempotent. If the request is retried, there may be duplicate playlists. Ideally, the request could be made idempotent.\r\n\r\nA common way to make a creation request idempotent is add a unique identifier to the request. The client would generate the identifier and make sure to send the same identifier for all retries of a given request. Then, the server would do the following set of operations in an atomic fashion:\r\n1. Check if an item with the client’s unique identifier already exists. If so, return it.\r\n2. Else, create the item and store the client’s unique identifier along with it."
