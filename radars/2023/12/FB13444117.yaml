    description: "Iâ€™m attempting to animate a Slider in SwiftUI driven by a value change with a custom animation and duration.  It does not work, no matter what I specify.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n1. Open the attached code file in SwiftUI project. \r\n2. Press the Animate button and observe the behavior. \r\n\r\nNotice the given linear duration of 10 is not respected, as the slider animates very quickly.  Any duration or animation curve (such as `easeOut`) is also not respected."
