    description: "The attached sample project sends an Add To Library request with an invalid catalog ID:\r\n```\r\nhttps://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/library?ids[songs]=fake-catalog-id\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, the request is successful.\r\n\r\nI assume the server is processing the request in a fire-and-forget manner. However, this approach makes it inconvenient for developers. Depending on the use case, the app would have to look up the catalog ID to make sure it is valid before adding it to the library. Instead, it would be great if the server could validate the catalog IDs synchronously, even if the actual mutation of the library is fire-and-forget."
