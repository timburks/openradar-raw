    description: "I have attached a sample project demonstrating a sheet being presented from a `NavigationSplitView` detail view. The sheet content defines a navigation title. When the sheet is presented, the navigation title shows up in both the sheet *and* the UI behind the sheet. Any preferences within a sheet—especially the navigation title—should not propagate outside of the sheet.\r\n\r\nThe bug only occurs on macOS."
