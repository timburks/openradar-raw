    description: "I am trying to use the Apple Music API to fetch a track in one storefront given a catalog ID from another storefront. This is the intended use case of the equivalent tracks API. However, the API sometimes returns tracks that are *not* equivalent.\r\n\r\nFor example, the attached sample project sends the following request:\r\n```\r\nhttps://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/us/songs?filter[equivalents]=156088084\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe catalog ID 156088084 is from the CA storefront but it does exist in the US storefront. (The song is “Legend of the Lamp” by “Alan Menken” in “Aladdin (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)”.)\r\n\r\nHowever, the above equivalent tracks request returns the following:\r\n```\r\nAppleMusicEquivalentCatalogTracksResponse(\r\n  tracks: [\r\n    AppleMusicCatalogTrack(\r\n      id: 1460037942,\r\n      title: \"Die Geschichte der Lampe\",\r\n      artistName: \"Peer Augustinski\",\r\n      albumName: Optional(\"Aladdin (Deutscher Original Film-Soundtrack)\")\r\n    )\r\n  ],\r\n  requestedCatalogIDToEquivalentCatalogIDs: [\r\n    156088084: [\r\n      1460037942\r\n    ]\r\n  ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe response indicates that 1460037942 is the equivalent track. However… the song is in a completely different language! In this case, the original catalog ID should have been returned since it was available in the US storefront."
