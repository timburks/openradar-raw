    description: "I have attached a sample project demonstrating the use of the `sheet(isPresented:content:)` modifier. The content closure reads an `@State` variable. However, the `@State` variableâ€™s value is stale when the content closure is executed.\r\n\r\nThis bug is likely related to the fact that the content closure is executed lazily, so a dependency on the `@State` variable is not set up. One workaround is for developers to use a closure capture list to capture the variable by value so that the `@State` variable is accessed during closure creation, correctly setting up the dependency. However, it is quite unfortunate for developers to have to know this. There must be a way that SwiftUI itself can fix this bug."
