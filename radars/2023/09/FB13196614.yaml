    description: "We have a custom .ideplugin in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Plug-ins that adds support for a new language spec that's saved in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications. With previous Xcode versions, this worked as expected, Xcode would ask if we want to load the bundle and then it'd work.\r\n\r\nWith the Xcode 15, it started crashing. I've run the Xcode binary directly to capture the crash info in the attached file xcode-crash.log.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter which plugin it is either. I tried to extract the PlistEditor plugin from the Xcode.app bundle, removed the code signature and changed the bundle id. After confirming I want to load it, Xcode crashes with the same crash log."
