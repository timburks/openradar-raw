    description: "I attached a minimal macOS app with a finder sync extension. The function `menu(for menuKind: FIMenuKind)` gets called when I click the toolbar item. However when right clicking in Finder, the function does not get called. Earlier versions of the OS this would give me the opportunity to inject a custom menu item in the default right-click menu in Finder. (FIMenuKind.contextualMenuForContainer). Now this functionality is broken. It only shows up on paths like ~/Library/… but not in anything in iCloud Drive like my desktop or documents directories. Rebooting and even using a different project (the sample project) does not fix it for me.\r\n\r\nI compiled a universal Mac app and tried it both on Ventura – where it did generate the menu correctly – and on Sonoma where it did not."
