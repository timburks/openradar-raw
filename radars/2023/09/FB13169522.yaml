    description: There’s a similar feedback open here FB13038621 but it seems that when you are creating your own context within a task on a background thread. The model context is always on the main thread it’s never on the background thread. I’ve attached a sample project but it seems that in my data manager I can’t perform any CRUD operations on a background thread
