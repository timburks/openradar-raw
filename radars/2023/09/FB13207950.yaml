    description: "It would be helpful for apps to find out whether the user has enabled the “Show toolbar button shapes” accessibility option, so that custom controls on the toolbar can be drawn correctly.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar property `accessibilityShowButtonShapes` exposed as a SwiftUI environment value, however it is not accessible from AppKit.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- AppKit views, such as custom subclasses of NSControl should be able to find out if the user has the “Show toolbar button shapes” option enabled.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n- There is currently no API to support this use case."
