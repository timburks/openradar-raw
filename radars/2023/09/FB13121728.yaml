The view is pasted below:\r\n\r\nstruct TestTabView: View {\r\n    @State var tabIndex: Int\r\n    let tabs: [String] = [\"Tab1\", \"Tab2\", \"Tab3\"]\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n\r\n        VStack {\r\n            // the tab view\r\n            HStack {\r\n                ForEach(tabs.indices, id: \\.self) { index in\r\n                    Text(\"tab \\(index)\")\r\n                        .onTapGesture {\r\n                            tabIndex = index\r\n                        }\r\n                        .foregroundColor(tabIndex == index ? .red : .black)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            TabView(selection: $tabIndex) {\r\n                ForEach(tabs.indices, id: \\.self) { index in\r\n                    Text(\"Showing content of Tab \\(index)\")\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            .tabViewStyle(.page(indexDisplayMode: .automatic))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- use the view above\r\n- set the index to 1 in the initializer for the view\r\n- run the code, and attempt to tap on “Tab1” (index 0)\r\n- It does not work the first time. If you tap another tab first, and then go to 0, it does work. Swiping back also works\r\n\r\nThis issue makes using the page view style for any purpose where it does not start at index 0 very difficult."
