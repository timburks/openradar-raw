    description: "When content is embedded in a NavigationView and somehow moves up underneath the NavigationView’s navigation bar, it generally appears underneath the bar using a translucent effect. This is most commonly seen when that content is contained within a ScrollView as it is desirous to appear “underneath” the bar.\r\n\r\nHowever, when that content is instead contained in a paged TabView (which is, itself, contained in a NavigationBar), the content does not appear to go underneath the navigation bar. Instead, it appears to be clipped.\r\n\r\nVerified in iOS 17 RC both on-device and in the Simulator. I have attached a sample project that demonstrates this, as well as some screenshots that exhibit it.\r\n\r\nNote: This may be related to feedback FB12448171 which documents similarly-unexpected behavior relating to content in a TabView in conjunction with a sheet. This sample project demonstrates that behavior as well."
