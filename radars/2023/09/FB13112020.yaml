    description: "The MapKit JS source file (https://cdn.apple-mapkit.com/mk/5.x.x/mapkit.js) ends with the following line:\r\n\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=https://mw-ci1-mapkitjs.geo.apple.com/admin/source-maps/5.76.64/source-maps/mapkit.min.js.map\r\n\r\nHowever, the URL it contains is not reachable (mw-ci1-mapkitjs.geo.apple.com canâ€™t be resolved).\r\n\r\nThis causes an error/warning to appears in the browser console on Safari, Firefox and Chrome (see the screenshot attached).\r\n\r\nSince the URL seems to be internal to Apple, the sourceMappingURL comment should probably be omitted when sent to production users of MapKit JS."
