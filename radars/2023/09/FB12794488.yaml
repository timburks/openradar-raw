    description: "Compiled the MailKit sample app (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mailkit/build_mail_app_extensions) and dropped it into my Applications folder. This Mac hasn't used Mail up until now but I enabled it Mail > Settings > Extensions > \"SampleMailExtensions\" then the app would crash after a few seconds. App doesn't crash if SampleMailExtensions is disabled.\r\n\r\nCrashed Thread:        7  Dispatch queue: MCTaskHandler queue\"\r\n\r\nSomeone else has a similar on-startup crash with the sample MailKit Mail Extension enabled in Mail. His Mail.app crashes on startup. His seems to crash in \"Dispatch queue: IMAPNetworkTaskHandler queue (QOS: BACKGROUND)\" which is slightly different than the crash I reported above.\r\n\r\nLikely related to MEMessageSecurityHandler?\r\n\r\nmacOS Ventura 13.6, Sonoma 14.0 beta 6"
