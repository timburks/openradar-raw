    description: "The plutil -lint command does not catch syntax errors when there are double semicolons (;;) present in a Localizable.strings file. Additionally, there is no runtime warning or error indicating that the localization file is broken, making the debugging process extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\nCreate a new Localizable.strings file for a macOS or iOS project.\r\nInsert a key-value pair that ends with a double semicolon (\"key\" = \"value\";;).\r\nRun plutil -lint [path_to_file].\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nplutil -lint should catch the syntax error and return an error message. Additionally, the system should generate a runtime message warning about the broken localization file.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nplutil -lint reports that the file is OK, and there are no runtime warnings or errors about the broken file.\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\nManually inspect the Localizable.strings file for syntax errors or develop a custom linting tool.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\nThis issue is critical for developers who rely on plutil -lint for automated checking of Localizable.strings files and can lead to localization issues that are hard to debug."
