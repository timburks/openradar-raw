    description: 'In iOS 17.0.0, parents (or anyone for that matter) can no longer delete the #images GIF search iMessages app from Apple. This could be removed in prior versions of iOS. Third-party apps can be removed from the Settings app, but not the ones from Apple. This change is going to expose millions of kids to the possibility of searching for, seeing, and sending sexually graphic images. If you think I''m overstating the case, try searching for "bikini" or "lingerie" in the messages app, and then think about the fact that parents no longer have the ability to prevent their kids from accessing this content. This represents a huge step backwards for the safety of iOS devices.'
