    description: "Posted on Apple Developer Forum https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/737223\r\n\r\nHello\r\n\r\n# Goal\r\nI would like to incrementally retrieve logs of my iOS App from the Unified Logging System using `OSLogStore`.\r\n\r\n# Steps \r\n1. First I initialize the store\r\n  `store = try OSLogStore(scope: .currentProcessIdentifier)`\r\n\r\n2. Second I set a position from which I want the logs using either : \r\n  `position = store.position(timeIntervalSinceLatestBoot: 0)` // to get the logs from the launch of the App \r\n  `position = store.position(date: Date().addingTimeInterval(-10))` // to get the logs of the last 10 seconds \r\n\r\n3. Third I get the entries in the store from the position \r\n  `store.getEntries(at: position)` \r\n\r\n# Issue \r\nWhatever the position I set using from OSLogStore: \r\n```\r\nposition(timeIntervalSinceLatestBoot:) position(date:) position(timeIntervalSinceEnd:)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the logs are retrieved. I cannot get only the subset requested by the specified timeframe\r\n\r\n# Sample\r\nA sample LogScreen that has 2 buttons is attached to the post \r\n- 1 button to fetch logs since the last time they have been fetched \r\n- 1 button to add a log The code has been simplified to ease the comprehension of the case, please be indulgent to the shortcuts that have been taken. \r\n\r\n# References https://developer.apple.com/documentation/oslog/oslogstore https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/705868 https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10226/ \r\n\r\n# Environment \r\nXCode 15b7 \r\nSimulator iPhone 14 Pro / iOS 17 \r\nDevice iPhone 13 / iOS 16.6.1"
