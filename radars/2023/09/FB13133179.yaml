    description: "Right now standard system colors do not include a `destructive` color. This means that developers have to work to do things like take local cultural norms around color into account (eg, red is good in Chinese culture, so don’t use it for destructive buttons), and that they cannot easily ensure their buttons’ destructive colors match the system’s. \r\n\r\nHere is the current list of standard system colors: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/standard_colors - as you can see, while there are several affordances for using `destructive` as a parameter on things like alerts, there is not a (publicly) defined color for destructive actions. \r\n\r\nThis color should be added to both UIKit and SwiftUI. \r\n\r\nAffects all currently supported versions of the API as of 9/7/23\x10."
