    description: "1. Add AUNewTimePitch audio unit to audio chain\r\n2. Set kNewTimePitchParam_EnablePeakLocking (kNewTimePitchParam_EnableSpectralCoherence) to false\r\n3. Perform pitch shifting and time stretching on it\r\n4. The app crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS in PhaseVocoderTwo::ShiftBins\r\n\r\nThe steps are not very specific. I haven't been able to create small example that consistently crashes. \r\n\r\nAttached is one of many crash reports that we see in production."
