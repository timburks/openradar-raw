    description: "Presenting a view controller with `UIModalPresentationStyle.pageSheet` modal style has a retain cycle when `prefersGrabberVisible` on the `sheetPresentationController`.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample repo that demonstrates the leak: https://github.com/bdotdub/SheetPresentationGrabberLeak\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a view controller\r\n2. Set `modalPresentationStyle` to `.pageSheet`\r\n3. Set `prefersGrabberVisible` to `true` on the view controller's `sheetPresentationController`\r\n4. Present the view controller\r\n5. Dismiss the view controller\r\n\r\nThe expected result is that the view controller is deallocated after it is dismissed. The actual result is that the view controller is still in memory. You can confirm this by debugging the memory graph"
