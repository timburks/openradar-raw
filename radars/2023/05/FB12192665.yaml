    description: "This issue started happening in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura. The issue is not reproducible in iOS 15 or macOS Monterey.\r\n\r\n1. In AU Lab (or some other DAW) add a file player\r\n2. Load sample piano file (attached to this report)\r\n3. Add AUNewTimePitch effect\r\n4. Pitch shift it by some amount (e.g. 1200 cents)\r\n5. Play a file\r\n6. Observe - There is distortion in the background (the sound is as if it was under water, wavy)\r\n\r\nThis issue is not reproducible with AUNewPitch.\r\n\r\nAttached is a AU Lab recording:\r\n\r\n1. First few seconds are without any effect\r\n2. Next few seconds are with AUNewPitch where we see expected behaviour\r\n3. Last part is AUNewTimePitch where we can hear distortion"
