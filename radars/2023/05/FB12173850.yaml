    description: "With a pluralization rule for \"one\" and \"other\", the French localization selects the \"one\" rule for argument 0.\r\n\r\nPlease run the attached sample which has a Localizable.stringsDict file for English and French. Both have pluralization rules for \"one\" and \"other\". The sample app prints the localized strings for arguments 0, 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nRun in the Simulator once with Locale English (USA) and once with French (France):\r\n\r\nEnglish: 0 places, 1 place, 2 places (correct)\r\nFrench: 1 endroit, 1 endroit, 2 endroits (wrong for argument 0)"
