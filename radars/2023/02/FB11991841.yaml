    description: "This issue involves Xcode’s integration with Swift Package Manager. I had filed an issue on the open-source swift-package-manager repo but I think this issue is within Xcoderather than SPM itself. More context in https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/issues/6143\r\n\r\nXcode does not show the correct latest tag when the package being added has `10` as a major version. In my example, I have a package tagged with `9.0.0` and `10.0.0`. When adding it in a client project, one would expect `10.0.0` to show as the current major version to pin at, but Xcode keeps showing `9.0.0`.\r\n\r\n### Reproducing the issue\r\n\r\n1. Create a package and host it on a repo\r\n2. Push a tag with a major version under `10` (e.g. `9.0.0`)\r\n3. Push a tag with a major version of `10` (e.g. `10.0.0`)\r\n4. In a client project, add the package via Xcode.\r\n5. On the package preview page, selecting the _Up to Next Major Version_ dependency rule will pin 9.0.0 as the current major version. **This is unexpected as the latest version is 10.0.0.**\r\n\r\nHere is a repro project with instructions: https://github.com/ncooke3/MyPackage. Try adding it as a package to see the unexpected tag behavior."
