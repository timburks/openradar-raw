    description: MapKit JS has an undocumented private API that allows a map to be zoomed when the user scrolls, `map._allowWheelToZoom`. On web pages that have full-screen maps, this feature makes the user experience much better for people using a mouse. Some websites such as DuckDuckGo are already using it, but rely on the undocumented API. An official API for this feature would be a great addition to MapKit JS.
