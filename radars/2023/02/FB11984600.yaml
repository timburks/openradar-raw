    description: "Reproducible only on iOS 16 (tested on iPhone X 16.3 and simulator 16.2).\r\nOn iOS 15 (device iPhone 8 15.6 and simulator 15.5) were background still transparent even when list dont have any element.\r\nI have tried to set background color of list to different color (green) but when list were empty, whole screen were filled with White/Black.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n create SwiftUI List with .listStyle(.plain) and make it empty.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n Whole screen is filled with Black/White (depends on theme).\r\nExpected:\r\n Should be same as on iOS 15 - No Cell displayed and set color should be displayed - default transparent and View in background visible just like when there is one element.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny error/warning/info in Xcode log"
