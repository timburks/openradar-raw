    description: "When discovering audio devices using `AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession`, we're receiving audio interfaces connected through Continuity even though the `.externalUnknown` option is not being sent to the list of device types. Similarly, checking the property `isContinuityCamera` on those audio devices return `false`. I believe this attribute should be renamed to `isContinuityDevice`, since Continuity encompasses audio interfaces as well.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with the following steps:\r\n1. Setup Continuity in a mobile device.\r\n2. Download the example project from this documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/capture_setup/supporting_continuity_camera_in_your_macos_app\r\n3. Modify the file ContinuityCam/Camera.swift line 182 to remove `.externalUnknown` from the desired AUDIO DISCOVERY SESSION\r\n4. Check the devices yielded by the API. There will be Continuity audio devices, when there shouldn't be none"
