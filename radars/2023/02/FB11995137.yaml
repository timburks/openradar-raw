    description: "Since at least 2 recent versions of Ventura (maybe a bit earlier) I noticed extremely annoying bug when VPN connection silently dies (while VPN is still connected), and nothing but manual disconnection / reconnection brings my internet back to life. \r\n\r\nI’ve tested it extensively and can confirm the bug is reproducible on multiple VPN providers with different protocols (IKEv2 and L2TP), on different connections (my local wifi, mobile tethered connection, 3rd party wifi). \r\n\r\nTo setup a test case: \r\n- run `iperf3 -s` on a remote host\r\n- connect to a VPN\r\n- locally run the following commands: \r\n$ iperf3 -c test.host  -i 1 -t 20  -b 100m\r\n$ perf3 -c test.host  -i 1 -t 20 -u -b 100m\r\n\r\n\r\nNote the second command contains `-u` flag, which results tests to be run over UDP. While TCP tests run w/o any problems, UDP test almost immediately kills the connection, i.e. not even ping works any longer. \r\n\r\nDuring normal work this can happen at any moment, I assume whenever some app pushes to much data over UDP or smth, and it’s maddening, as most of my work is over remote ssh-tunnels and it takes lots of reconnections and swearing to keep on going with my work day. Please take a look into it ASAP, as I’m sure many people face the same problem, but cannot reliably find the cause. \r\nI was hoping the most recent Ventura update fixes it, but nope. still here."
