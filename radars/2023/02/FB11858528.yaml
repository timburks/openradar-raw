    description: "On an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 12.6.1 (21G217), when using the Virtualization Framework to run a macOS VM running, uploads to AWS S3 using either the awscli or aws-ruby-sdk become 10-50x slower than they are when run on the host machine itself. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the detailed bug reports in their respective repositories:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/2803\r\n- https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/7481\r\n\r\n——\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by following the steps below:\r\n\r\n1. Download VirtualBuddy version 1.2.2 (https://github.com/insidegui/VirtualBuddy/releases/tag/1.2.2)\r\n2. Setup a VM using an image of macOS 13.0.1\r\n3. Once the OS is installed, using terminal install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)\r\n4. Follow the instructions to setup Homebrew in Terminal\r\n5. Install rbenv with brew install rbenv\r\n6. Follow the instructions to setup rbenv\r\n7. Install Ruby 3.0.3 using rbenv install 3.0.3\r\n8. Set Ruby 3.0.3 as the global version using rbenv global 3.0.3\r\n9. Download and extract the contents of Sample.zip into a directory (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/files/10170646/Sample.zip)\r\n10. Modify the key and region variables in aws-debug.rb\r\n11. Ensure that the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables are set\r\n12. In terminal, cd into the directory\r\n13. Run sh script.sh\r\n13. Observe the output and compare the statistics printed by time by running steps 3-13 on the host machine as well\r\n\r\nHost Machine: 0m 11.101s\r\nVM: 5m 51.659s"
