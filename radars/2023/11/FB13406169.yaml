    description: "`DisclosureGroup` currently builds its content view immediately. However, the content view may perform expensive operations (e.g. fetching data via SwiftDataâ€™s `@Query` macro). If there are many `DisclosureGroup` instances in a given `List`, SwiftUI would wait for all of those expensive operations to complete before showing the `List`, even though all of the `DisclosureGroup` instances are initially in a collapsed state.\r\n\r\nInstead, `DisclosureGroup` could build its content view during the first expansion. That way, a `List` of `DisclosureGroup` instances could be loaded in a scalable manner."
