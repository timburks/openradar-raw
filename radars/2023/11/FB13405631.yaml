    description: "I have attached a sample project that contains a `Menu` with a `Button` inside it. Pressing the button should present a sheet. Unexpectedly, the sheet is not presented if it is declared inside the `Menu` body on the `Button`. The sheet *is* presented if it is declared on the `Menu`.\r\n\r\nWorks:\r\n```\r\nMenu(…) {\r\n   Button(…) {\r\n      …\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n.sheet(…) {\r\n   …\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes not work:\r\n```\r\nMenu(…) {\r\n   Button(…) {\r\n      …\r\n   }\r\n   .sheet(…) {\r\n      …\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is important because it prevents developers from encapsulating their code. For example, we may want to encapsulate the `Button` and the associated sheet into a single view so that the view can be reused in multiple places, perhaps both inside a `Menu` and outside of one. However, this issue forces developers to separate the `Button` and the sheet code because the sheet code needs to be outside of the `Menu` body while the `Button` needs to be inside the `Menu` body."
