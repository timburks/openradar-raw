    description: "The documentation summary says the `ModelActor` macro “Converts a Swift class into a stored model that’s managed by SwiftData.” This is not at all what the macro does. Indeed, it looks like this was copy-pasted verbatim from the `Model` macro documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/model().\r\n\r\nInstead, the documentation summary should be similar to that of the `ModelActor` protocol: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/modelactor. Also, the discussion section should describe what the macro does: it conforms the actor to the `ModelActor` protocol and it generates an `init(modelContainer:)` initializer that sets up the model executor with a background model context."
