    description: "When you have to authenticate in the appstore â€” you might want to autofill your password, but apparently it is not possible. \r\nExample scenario: \r\n\r\n- Go into AppStore app \r\n- Logout \r\n- Kill AppStore app \r\n- open AppStore app \r\n- choose some random app to install \r\n- login screen shows up \r\n\r\nExpectations: - easy autofill experience with properly suggested accounts \r\n\r\nReally: - complete mess, even text field editing popup with autofill option is not always easy to get\r\n\r\nAdditional comments: this also happens when you logged in and using in-app purchase. In that case you should provide password but again autofill is not available, no password suggestion either."
