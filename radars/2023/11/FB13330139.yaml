    description: "When writing a performance test (using XCTest and measure(_:)), Xcode seems to ignore any saved baseline. Even though there *is* a matching performance baseline saved, Xcode states there is none (“No baseline average for Time.” in source editor) and will never fail the test, no matter how much slower it gets.\r\n\r\nWhen you save a baseline in the “performance result” popover, the popover does acknowledge the existence of the baseline, but the rest of Xcode does not. If you relaunch Xcode, the popover doesn't acknowledge the baseline anymore.\r\n\r\nAll of this is despite baseline files being seemingly properly generated, when you define one by Accepting a test result.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce using the provided sample project:\r\n- Run the `testPerformanceExample()` test\r\n- Accept its result as the baseline\r\n- Change the timer to go slower and re-run the test\r\n- Xcode doesn't fail the test, and states there is no baseline\r\n\r\nTo reproduce from scratch:\r\n- Create a new app project with tests\r\n- Rig a dummy performance test\r\n- Then, follow the steps above"
