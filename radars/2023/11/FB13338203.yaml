    description: "I believe there’s an issue with the USB audio drivers on iOS, that doesn’t exist on iPadOS or macOS.\r\n\r\nThis dongle works on:\r\n\r\n* iPad OS 17.0 (21A329) on a 4th gen iPad Air\r\n* macOS 14.0 (23A344) on an M2 MacBook Air\r\n\r\nOn these devices, the dongle shows up as an audio output device, and can play audio out to headphone correctly. Plugging in a USB C power cable for simultaneous charging works on both devices.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the iPhone 15 (iOS 17.0.3 21A360) supports it as an audio output device, but stops the moment the power cable is plugged in. At that point, the “accessory plugged in” icon on the dynamic island disappears and reappears repeatedly. The iPhone can charge, or play audio, but not both at the same time.\r\n\r\nSee the attached video recording.\r\n\r\n0:08 - Adapter plugged in, headphones only. “KT USB Audio” appears in audio output, headphones are playing audio as expected.\r\n0:22 - Charging cable plugged into adapter. “KT USB Audio” audio output disappears, headphone audio cuts out\r\n0:36 - Charging cable unplugged, “KT USB Audio” reappears in audio output, headphone audio resumes."
