    description: "I have attached a sample project that contains a `List` with a `DisclosureGroup`. Upon expansion or collapse of the `DisclosureGroup`, another view is updated. This update should be animated but it is currently not being animated.\r\n\r\nThis is only an issue on macOS. iOS correctly animates the update."
