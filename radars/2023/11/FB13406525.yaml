    description: "I have attached a sample project that demonstrates using `DynamicViewContent.onDelete` to enable deletion of elements in a dynamic `List`. This works great on iOS, automatically providing standard deletion UI in edit mode and enabling swipe-to-delete. However, the macOS implementation seems a little bare, only allowing deletion via the Edit menu using a pointing device.\r\n\r\nOne would expect that the Delete menu item would at least have a keyboard shortcut configured so that the user could delete via the delete key. It would also be great if `onDelete` could add to the element a context menu with a Delete menu item."
