    description: "Create an app that runs the following code: \r\n\r\n``` \r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        ScrollView {\r\n            LazyVGrid(columns: columns, spacing: 16) {\r\n                ForEach(0..<41) { item in\r\n                    Rectangle()\r\n                        .foregroundColor(.blue)\r\n                        .frame(height: 135)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var columns: [GridItem] {\r\n        [GridItem(.flexible(), spacing: 16), GridItem(.flexible(), spacing: 16)]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhen I run it on my device, I get a crash after doing the following: \r\n\r\n- scroll to the bottom\r\n- rotate the device\r\n- scroll to the top\r\n\r\n The LazyVGrid crash is the most common crash that the 100.000 users of our app on the App Store experience, so it is not a small issue. \r\n\r\nIt does not happen on all devices that I have got, but I have seen the crash on both iPhones and iPads and it is very easy to reproduce. \r\n\r\nYou might also be interested in the response to my question here, where it is stated that the crash even happens in your own sample code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77572346#77574654"
