    description: "When opening Xcode's view debugger, all text views in the app are forced into TextKit 1 mode.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n- From Xcode, run an app with a NSTextView instance running in TextKit 2 mode.\r\n- In Xcode, open the view debugger.\r\n- The text view is now in TextKit 1 mode.\r\n\r\nAttached is a repro project: just run it, open the view debugger, and you'll get a “\U0001F4DD Switching to TextKit 1” message in the console."
