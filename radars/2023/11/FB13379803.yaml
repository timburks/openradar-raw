    description: "The issue is discussed on the Swift forums: https://forums.swift.org/t/how-to-get-access-to-a-view-defined-inside-a-preview-macro/68302\r\n\r\nBut briefly, the old SwiftUI preview system made it possible to access the views created inside the preview type (because the previews property is a View). This could then be referenced in screenshot testing targets by simply using MyType_Previews.previews (or even some other property that we could have added). This is impossible with the #Preview macro, because even if we somehow could access the unique type name produced by the macro (unlikely), the relevant method still returns `DeveloperToolsSupport.Preview` instead of a View instance. Therefore we need to either extract the setup somewhere, which is not great if we have multiple previews.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Xcode doesn’t recognize the #Preview macro when it is generated by another macro (the preview canvas won’t show up). If this worked, we could just wrap #Preview with our own macro that would create #Preview, along with some other code that we could then use to reference in the tests."
