    description: "I have a model class that has a persistent property for a `Codable` enum. If the enum type is written a certain way, the app will crash because SwiftData encounters the following fatal error: `Could not cast value of type 'Swift.Optional<Any>' (0x1f5b7ff50) to 'SwiftDataCodableEnumCrash.Item.NestedEnum' (0x102a14cd0)`. The full stack trace is attached.\r\n\r\nI have attached a minimal sample project reproducing the issue. `Item.swift` is annotated with comments explaining the significance of certain pieces of code. Below is a summary of the conditions that are needed to trigger the SwiftData bug:\r\n- There needs to be a nested enum.\r\n- Within the nested enum, there needs to be a case without an associated value."
