    description: "One use case for `Picker` is as a tab switcher. This would normally be used in cases where the tabs are at a lower level in the user interface. For example, see the Photos macOS app. (For top-level tabs, one would use `TabView` or a sidebar instead.)\r\n\r\nFor macOS, iPad, and iPhones with wider screens, the idiom would be a segmented control in the center of the toolbar. For iPhones with narrower screens, one might instead want a menu in the toolbar. It would be great if `DefaultPickerStyle` could automatically determine whether the `Picker` is inside the “principal” toolbar item section and configure the `Picker` accordingly.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it would be great if `DefaultPickerStyle` would automatically recognize the following setup:\r\n```\r\ncontent\r\n  .toolbar {\r\n    ToolbarItem(placement: .principal) {\r\n      Picker(\"My Tabs\", selection: $selectedTab) {\r\n        …\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, `DefaultPickerStyle` configures the above `Picker` to show a menu. Instead, it would be great if the above `Picker` could automatically be a segmented control when the window has a regular horizontal size class and a menu when the window has a compact horizontal size class."
