    description: "I have attached a sample project demonstrating a `DisclosureGroup` inside of a `List`. The `DisclosureGroup` body has a dynamic `ForEach`. When there are elements in the `ForEach`, the `DisclosureGroup` behaves correctly. However, if the list of `ForEach` elements is empty, the `DisclosureGroup` erroneously does not display its chevron.\r\n\r\nThis bug only occurs on macOS. iOS always shows the chevron, regardless of how many elements are in the `ForEach` list."
