    description: "Also see https://github.com/apple-opensource/ld64/issues/2\r\n\r\nApparently you guys made quite some changes in recent ld64 iterations, which do cause issues with third parties app that produce MachO files directly and then feed them to ld64. Itâ€™s likely that such third party apps do something unexpected, thus it would be great to have the ld64 source code accessible.\r\n\r\nThank you."
