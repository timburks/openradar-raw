    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nInstantiating a CLLocationButton in a XIB causes SF Symbol images to not be found\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nâ€ŒSomething else not on this list\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat was the error?\r\nCould not load the \"house.fill\" image referenced from a nib in the bundle with identifier \"com.hotngui.TestImages\"\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nWhen I create an instance of a CLLocationButton in a view that is defined with an XIB file I cannot use any system SF Symbols. I get this error at run time for every image view that references a System image: Could not load the \"house.fill\" image referenced from a nib in the bundle with identifier \"com.hotngui.TestImages\" [Unknown process name] CGBitmapContextCreateImage: invalid context 0x0. If you want to see the backtrace, please set CG_CONTEXT_SHOW_BACKTRACE environmental variable. See the attached sample project. It's really bare bones.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nScenario: * I have a project that defines a custom view that uses a XIB file. * I instantiate it in a storyboard. * I have an image in the top level view that references a SF Symbol If I instantiate a CLLocationButton in the custom view it breaks all images that reference SF Symbols. If I instantiate the same CLLocationButton in the top level VC everything works fine. It should be noted that I do not even have to add the CLLocationButton to the view hierarchy in order to get the same error; creating an instance is enough.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nCreating an instance of a CLLocationButton should have no effect on unrelated images.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nI get the error message and no images are displayed."
