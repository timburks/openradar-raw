    description: "When you have a SwiftUI `ScrollView` that has a fixed bar added at the bottom using the `safeAreaInset(edge:alignment:spacing:content:)` modifier, there is no way to prevent the safe area inset content from being pushed up by the keyboard when a text field is focused.\r\n\r\nFor example, say that you have the following screen:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n  var body: some View {\r\n    ScrollView {\r\n      ForEach(1..<20, id: \\.self) { index in\r\n        TextField(\"Title \\(index)\", text: $text).padding(24)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom, spacing: 0) {\r\n      BottomBar()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @State private var text = \"\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct BottomBar: View {\r\n  var body: some View {\r\n    Color.red.ignoresSafeArea(.container).frame(height: 44)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen any of the `TextField` is focused, the `BottomBar` will be lifted up by the height of the keyboard so that it floats above it. Unfortunately, there is no way to disable this behavior that while still insetting the `ScrollView` by the height of the bottom bar when the keyboard is hidden. Ideally, there would be an API that allows you to specify that the `BottomBar` should not be affected by the keyboard safe area while still insetting the scroll view by the height of the `BottomBar` when the keyboard is not visible.\r\n\r\nIf you call `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)` modifier after the `.safeAreaInset(edge:alignment:spacing:content:)` modifier, then the keyboard will not inset the `ScrollView`'s content, and it will be impossible to scroll to the bottom of the list when the keyboard is visible.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is to use a `FocusState` and conditionally remove the `BottomBar` when any text field is focused, but is not as robust as preventing the bottom bar from being lifted up."
