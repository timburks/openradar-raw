    description: "Local notifications scheduled on Apple Watch are always 13 seconds delayed (by the OS).\r\n\r\nSee this thread: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/696280\r\n\r\nIn my testing I can confirm the 13 second delay when notifications are scheduled on the Watch App.\r\n\r\nThe notifications arrive on time if they are scheduled from the iOS app.\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround for this? I see the comment left on the forum but it doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nI have a sample Xcode project that reproduces this.\r\n\r\nExpected result: notification is received after 10 seconds\r\nActual result: notification is received after 23 seconds"
