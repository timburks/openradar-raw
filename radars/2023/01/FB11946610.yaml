    description: When building a SwiftPM package in Xcode via the built in SPM support (e.g. by directly opening the package's containing folder as a project, rather than creating a separate .xcodeproj file), the equivalent of Xcode's "Build Only Active Architectures" build setting is inaccessible. A debug configuration always builds only for the architecture of the host machine, and a release configuration always builds for both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures. This is not always desirable, but there exists no means of controlling this behavior either via Package.swift or through Xcode GUI. This capability does exist for native Xcode projects, and also when using the "swift build" command from the commandline, making the disparity only more obvious. This becomes especially noticeable for large release builds where only one architecture is actually required for the build in question.
