    description: "- Go to blinq.me/1BCOak3XKTfe on Safari or Chrome on an iPhone (this will take you to a Blinq digital business card)\r\n- Click Save Contact\r\n- Click Save to contacts\r\n- The contact pop up will now appear. If you press “Done” in the top left corner it doesn’t save the contact to your phone, it just closes the pop up. You need to scroll down and click “Create new contact” to open the contact save popup, and then you need to click “Done” in the top right to confirm saving the contact.\r\n\r\nWe have an overwhelming amount of feedback that people assume that clicking “Done” in the contact pop saves the contact to their phone.\r\n\r\nIt’s extremely unintuitive that you need to scroll down and click “Create new contact” to achieve this outcome.\r\n\r\nIt would be so much better if the contact popup gave two options instead of the “Done” button that is currently shown:\r\n1. Cancel\r\n2. Save"
