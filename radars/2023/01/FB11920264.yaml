    description: "Using the Accessibility option: \"Full Keyboard Access\" and a connected Bluetooth keyboard (Magic keyboard). \r\n\r\nGo to Settings > General > Legal & Regulatory > Legal Notices. It is not possible to access and scroll the list of legal notices. It seems scroll views with static text do not receive focus and it is not possible to scroll such views."
