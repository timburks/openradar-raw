    description: "When a Mac Catalyst app is run in *DEBUG* mode (from Xcode 14.2 (14C18)) on macOS Ventura (13.1), requestReview(in windowScene: UIWindowScene) fails to produce the expected request view as it should.  That request view *does*, however, appear when the app is run on macOS Monterey (12.6.2) or on an iOS / iPadOS 16.2 device.  The issue is clearly, then, a Ventura-specific one.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the SKStoreReviewController request view to appear on macOS Ventura in *debug* mode makes me worried that the SKStoreReviewController request view will similarly *also* fail to appear on macOS Ventura on a *release* version of an app.\r\n\r\nA bare-bones app that displays the issue can easily be created by (1) minimally modifying the app created from Xcode's iOS app template in order to run as a Mac Catalyst app and (2) adding a SKStoreReviewController.requestReview(in: windowScene) call in the UISceneDelegate.scene(_:willConnectTo:options:) method of the sceneDelegate."
