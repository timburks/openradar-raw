    description: "1. Open https://www.icloud.com/numbers/ in a web browser (e.g. Safari 16.2 on macOS 11.7.2 or Edge on Windows PC)\r\n2. Create a Numbers document with multiple tabs (worksheets).\r\n3. In Tab 1 (e.g. list of expenses) scroll down to e.g. 75%\r\n4. Now switch to Tab 2 (e.g. sums/stats per month, quarter, year)\r\n5. Switch back to Tab 1.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED: The Tab is at the same scrolling position (e.g. 75%). So that I can resume reading/editing where I was.\r\n\r\nACTUAL: Tab 1 jumps to the top position (=0%). This is horrible for efficiency/productivity. Each time you switch tabs, you have to find your data again. This makes productive work impossible in long spreadsheets.\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL: Each tab shall remember its scroll position. That state persistence the proper interaction design for an efficient usability. Please change this!"
