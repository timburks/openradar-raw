    description: "When presenting a view with `navigationBarTitleDisplayMode` set to `.automatic` via the sheet modifier (so that the navigation title transitions from large to inline when scrolling), the transition is not always smooth.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, check out the attached project and\r\n- tap on the “Present sheet” list item\r\n- scroll the list to see that the navigation title transitions from `.large` to `.inline` and vice-versa correctly\r\n- start to dismiss the sheet interactively be dragging it down a little bit (but not as much to actually dismiss the sheet) and then drag up again (so that the list eventually starts to scroll up)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe navigation title smoothly transitions from `.large` to `.inline`\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nThe navigation title is displayed as `.large` all the time without a smooth transition until the navigation title would be finally fully transitioned to the `.inline` state. When this happens, the navigation title “jumps” to `.inline` immediately. Until then the `.large` navigation title juts “sits” above the scrolled content, obscuring it.\r\n\r\nThis bug is also present when using UIKit. A sample workspace containing a SwiftUI and UIKit sample app is attached. A video showing the bug is also attached."
