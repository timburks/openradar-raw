    description: "We are using AVAudioUnitSampler to load different instruments from aupreset files. Some of our instruments have low polyphony level. When polyphony level is reached, AVAudioUnitSampler starts dropping notes. We would expect that the dropped notes are the ones that are first played (First in, first out). What we observed was that it was more random, usually not the newest notes, nor the oldest but some from the middle. We werenâ€™t able to figure out the algorithm of ordering dropped notes. It would never be the new one, but it would usually also not be the first ones. It was usually somewhere in the middle. It is usually more prominent when you play the notes fast. It can be hard to verify with just clicking on mouse, so added MIDI midi input clients.\r\n\r\n We are able to easily reproduce this issue in AU Lab's AUSampler.\r\nThe issue is not reproducible in Logic Pro and MainStage native samplers.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be happening only in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura and not on iOS 15."
