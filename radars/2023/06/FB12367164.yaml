    description: "Hi I'd like to change the predicate and sort descriptor with the new @Query. I require it to work for both data passed in from parent View and also from `@State` in the current View. I also require it to work with Table sorting, when clicking table column header updates a sort binding.\r\n\r\nI propose redesigning @Query to be a View modifier, e.g. similar to .task(id:) and .onChange(of:). I propose it to be either .query(predicate:sort:results:) { or .fetch(predicate:sort:results:) { where predicate are sort are as they are now and results is a binding to an array of the type being fetched. \r\n\r\nPlease also see FB12292784 which I believe is also requesting this ability.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nXcode Version 15.0 beta (15A5160n)\r\nIt's beta 1"
