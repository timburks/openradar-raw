    description: "When passing to use parameter pack function itself as a parameter to a different function (as a completion handler etc.) it will crash the compiler in Xcode 15 beta 1. Attached a simple playground with two different examples, which both crash.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this if passing parameter packs as a closure is supported, but is definitely should not crash.\r\n\r\nI expected parameter packs to be able to replace the code generation for this library, which has some very nice basic use cases for paramer packs: https://github.com/mkj-is/NoopKit#usage-examples"
