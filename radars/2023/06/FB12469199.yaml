    description: "In Interface Builder, merging a grid view's cells in specific circumstances causes the build to fail with the following error:\r\n“Exception while running ibtool: The column at index 2 contains a merged cell and cannot be removed.”\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n- Create a new AppKit Storyboard-based project\r\n- In the empty VC, add a table view\r\n- In one of the table view's cell templates, add a grid\r\n- In the grid, merge all cells of a given row together (or, all cells of a given column)\r\n\r\nThe project now fails to build, when it shouldn't.\r\nPerforming the same merge succeeds if the grid is not within a table view cell template.\r\n\r\nYou can download a sample repro project, created through the steps described above: <removed>\r\n\r\nTested in Xcode 14.3.1, and Xcode 15 beta 2."
