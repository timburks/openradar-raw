    description: "When setting a text style on a UIButton in a storyboard and later programmatically setting the button title, the text style is reset and a default font is used.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that setting just the String title using setTitle(_:for:) doesn't change the button font.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached project with two buttons, both configured with the .footnote text style. The right button title is programmatically changed and is displayed with a larger font size.\r\n\r\n(Reproducible using Xcode 15.0 beta 2 (15A5161b) on Simulator running iOS 15.0 - 17.0 beta 2)"
