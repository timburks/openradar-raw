    description: "I'm building a form editing experience in SwiftUI that has UI dependent on whether a text field is focused or not.\r\n\r\nMy usage of View.focused(_:) works perfectly fine when built with Xcode 14.3.1 on the simulator (iPhone 14 Pro Max with iOS 17) but when I switch over to Xcode 15 Beta 2 with the same exact code and same simulator my @FocusState variable is not updating correctly.\r\n\r\nI've attached as simple as possible repro code that mimics my form view's hierarchy. This code works as expected when built with Xcode 14.3.1 and is completely broken on 15 Beta 2.\r\n\r\nimport SwiftUI\r\n\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n    @State private var text = \"\"\r\n    \r\n    @FocusState var isFocused: Bool\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        ScrollView {\r\n            VStack {\r\n                TextField(\"Test\", text: $text)\r\n                    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)\r\n                    .focused($isFocused)\r\n                Text(\"Text Field Is Focused: \\(isFocused.description)\")\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}"
