    description: "When I set a button to a multiline title (depending on the localization, the title might need 2 lines) with titleAlignment = .center, the title is displayed left-aligned.\r\n\r\nNote: When I also configure a subtitle, both the title and the subtitle are center-aligned. So the titleAlignment isn't respected when the subtitle is nil."
