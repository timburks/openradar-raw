    description: "A nice-to-have to increase adoption of the `@Observable` macro would be to make it available pre-iOS 17 as well. Since macros are introduced in Swift 5.9 and are not dependent on a specific OS version, this should be doable.\r\n\r\nMany apps need to still support older versions of their OS (especially in a b2b environment)."
