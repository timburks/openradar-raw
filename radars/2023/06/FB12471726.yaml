    description: "UIButton.Configuration.contentsInsets is described to define the distance from the button's content area to its bounds. The content area also includes the image: as seen in this WWDC22 slide: https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10064?time=423\r\n\r\nHowever, an image whose native dimensions are larger than the content area isn't resized by the button. In fact, the contentInsets parameter doesn't affect the image size and there's no way to resize the image using UIButton.Configuration or UIButton (except the deprecated UIButton.imageEdgeInsets).\r\n\r\nEspecially with assets preserving vector data there should be an easy way to configure the image size of a button.\r\n\r\nThe sample app shows a button with a fixed height of 20 with the image bleeding over the edge of the button despite a contentInset being set."
