    description: "When listening to music from an iOS 17 device (iPhone 13) and when no audio is produced from the Mac (even if the volume is set to mute/0), it will always immediately move to Mac, while audio is on iPhone. Manually switching to iPhone, will be reverted in about half a second back to macOS. \r\n\r\nA workaround is (of course) disabling Bluetooth. I also found out that if I change the output device to the Mac speakers first (when forcibly connected to macOS) and then select the AirPods on iOS it wil work for a longer period of time. I _suspect_ that when the laptop has been brought out of sleep the same happens again. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce: start music playback on iPhone, open MacBook, it will then start switching forcibly to macOS after a couple of minutes. \r\n\r\nI expected it to be on iPhone, or stay on iPhone if I explicitly selected them there"
