    description: When attempting to play a track via MusicKit on the visionOS simulator, "MPMusicPlayerController is not available on the simulator" prints in the console and no music plays. Especially on visionOS, where we do not yet have hardware available, this means that it is simply not possible to test visionOS apps that integrate with MusicKit for potentially a very long time.
