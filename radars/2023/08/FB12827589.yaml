    description: "Resolved by Apple in iOS16.6.\r\n\r\nWhen calling AAAttribution.attributionToken() of AdServices (used to determine if an install originated by Apple Search Ads), the function has an unexpected behavior of resetting the SKAdNetwork fine Conversion Value to 0 and Coarse Conversion Value to none.\r\n\r\nThis only has an effect in SKAdNetwork 4.0 since before that version Conversion Values could only increase. Starting from version 4.0, they can also decrease, which triggers the bug whenever the attributionToken function is called.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ve published more details in our blog post here:\r\nhttps://www.singular.net/blog/skan-4-cv-reset-bug/"
