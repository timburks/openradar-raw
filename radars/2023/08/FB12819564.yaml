    description: "Currently, `AudioResource` conformers support local and remote audio files (`AudioFileResource`), audio buffers (`AudioBufferResource`), and file groups (`AudioFileGroupResource `). However, there is no way to play MusicKit resources such as `Song` or `Album` or `Track` in spatial audio on visionOS. This very much limits the types of apps that can be built with spatial audio, including a virtual record player as shown here: https://twitter.com/lickability/status/1686116489529565184. Please provide a way to play MusicKit resources in spatial audio. \r\n\r\nIf MusicKit provided a `AudioMusicItemResource` that was initialized with a `MusicItem` or something similar, this would go a long way towards enabling many new types of app in spatial audio."
