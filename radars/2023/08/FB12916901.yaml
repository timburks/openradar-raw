    description: "During our testing of iPadOS 17 Beta 4 and now 5, we have observed that DateTime objects appear to be initialized differently from what we had seen in iPadOS 16. Presently, we are running Xcode 14.3.1 with Xamarin.iOS v16.4.0.6, in Visual Studio for Mac 2022 v17.6.3 on a MacBook running Ventura 13.3.1 (although several combinations of different versions of these components have not resolved the issue). Examples of what we are seeing when creating DateTime variables:\r\n\r\nIn iPadOS 16, a typical DateTime (ToString()) shows as \"7/27/2021 4:49:10 PM\". In iPadOS 17 Beta, the same DateTime shows as \"7/27/2021 4:49:10 a\". A subsequent DateTime.Parse operation on the iPadOS 17 string leads to a \"Format_UnknownDateTimeWord\" exception in our application. The behavior is the same whether we are operating on a DateTime value from a database, or even just when creating a new DateTime object in code from scratch.\r\n\r\nIs this an expected behavior in iPadOS 17, or is it a known issue that is expected to be resolved in a future iPadOS 17 Beta release, and/or Xcode / Xamarin.iOS update? We would like any feedback or suggestions on whether others have encountered the same behavior in iPadOS 17 Beta, and how this should be addressed if it is the new expected behavior."
