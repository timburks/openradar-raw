    description: "\U0001F60D I’m in love with the feature of Macs with M-series processors that allows them to run iPhone and iPad apps from the App Store.\r\n\U0001F914 However, especially on high-resolution displays, even the Larger window size is very small.\r\n\U0001F47F The window hosting the iPhone app cannot be scaled, except to full-screen (that’s the weird part).\r\n\r\n\U0001F64F I am begging you, please allow arbitrary window scaling of iOS apps running on Macs! \U0001F64F\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Install an iPhone app from the iOS App Store (I’m using Dotify) onto an M-series Mac.\r\n2. Launch the app and wait for its window to appear.\r\n3. Notice that you can enter full-screen with this app.\r\n4. Notice that you can toggle between Small/Large window size, and portrait/landscape orientations.\r\n5. Attempt to resize the window.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n- The iOS app window scales smoothly, maintaining its fixed aspect ratio\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n- The iPhone app window is unable to be scaled, except for the Small/Large toggle."
