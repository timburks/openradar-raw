    description: "When using Toggle in SwiftUI, the underlying UISwitch is escaping the host view's bounds by 2 points on the right, resulting in a UISwitch escaping the screen's bounds if placed near the edge.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce it very easily; just place a toggle anywhere and observe the view hierarchy, or place it near the edge & watch it being cut off. Inset it by 2pt and it'll look great.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this using: - Xcode 15.0.0 (15A240d) on iOS 17 (device & simulator) and iPadOS 17 (simulator) - Xcode 14.3.1 (14E300c) on iOS 16 (simulator)."
