    description: 'I have a custom keybindings for Font size -> increase/decrease. After updating Xcode from 14 to 15 noticed that they stopped working. The settings seemed to have been carried over from the previous version, so it should work. I then noticed these three new commands: Font Size -> Increase (Editor menu for Xcode.IDEKit.EditorDocument.StructuredConsoleEditorDocument) Font Size -> Decrease (Editor menu for Xcode.IDEKit.EditorDocument.StructuredConsoleEditorDocument) Font Size -> Reset (Editor menu for Xcode.IDEKit.EditorDocument.StructuredConsoleEditorDocument) Just looking at the not so layman description "Xcode.IDEKit.EditorDocument.StructuredConsoleEditorDocument" tells me something is wrong. Previously overriding this was enough: Font size -> Increase (Editor Menu for Source code) Font size -> Decrease (Editor Menu for Source code) Expected behavior: Only being required to set shortcuts for "source code" in order to override the shortcuts for the source code editor. Actual behavior: Being required to modify additional commands in order to make the override work properly. I have bound the key to cmd+shift+''-'' and bound "Comment selection" to cmd+''-'', which didn''t work until I modified the last two commands mentioned above.'
