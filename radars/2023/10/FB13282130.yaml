    description: "Dear Apple Feedback Team:\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to suggest a refinement in the way iOS 17's \"Focus Modes\" interact with the \"Always On Display\" filter on supported iPhone models.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nWithin the \"Focus Modes\", users can enable specific \"Focus Filters\", one of which pertains to the \"Always On Display\" functionality. This is an intuitive and welcomed addition, as it offers the possibility to control the visibility of various notifications and alerts during different situations. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that while users can toggle the \"Always On Display\" from this section, they cannot access or customise the advanced settings for this feature without navigating to \"Settings -> Display & Brightness -> Always On Display\".\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n\r\nIt would be incredibly beneficial for users to have direct access to the advanced settings for the \"Always On Display\" right from the \"Focus Filters\" section. This would streamline the user experience by reducing the need for navigating to different sections of the settings app, especially when they are setting up or modifying their focus modes.\r\n\r\nI have attached two screenshots for your reference:\r\n\r\n* Focus Filter for \"Always On Display\".\r\n* Advanced settings available under \"Settings -> Display & Brightness -> Always On Display\".\r\n\r\nBy integrating these settings cohesively, it would not only make the process more efficient but also provide a more unified and intuitive experience for users. Such integration is in line with Apple's ethos of simplicity and user-centric design.\r\n\r\nUse cases:\r\n\r\nWork Mode: A user has activated their \"Work Mode\" focus mode. They want the \"Always On Display\" filter to be enabled, with Always On Display (AOD) enabled but with the “show wallpaper” option disabled.\r\n\r\nPersonal Relaxation Mode: The same user can enable this mode on weekends or during relaxation time. They want the “Always On Display” filter enabled, with AOD enabled, showing the wallpaper, but with the AOD notification option disabled.\r\n\r\nStudy Mode: The same user can enable this mode while at classroom. They want the “Always On Display” filter enabled, so the AOD is disabled.\r\n\r\nFinal words:\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I trust in Apple's commitment to continuously enhance user experience, and I believe this small refinement could be a valuable addition to an already impressive feature set."
