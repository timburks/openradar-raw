    description: Throughout our app, we use _VariadicView extensively to implement our design system. Specifically, we need to manipulate view children, read and adjust their size, read and set view traits, and apply view modifiers to them. There are some cases where Layout supports what we need, but that doesn't allow you to conditionally show a child view.
