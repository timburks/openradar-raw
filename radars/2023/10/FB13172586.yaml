    description: "It appears that the `Append to Note` Siri Shortcuts action is no longer able to correctly append formatted rich text URLs, specifically. This issue became immediately apparent when I first upgraded my iPad Pro from iPadOS 16 to the first Developer Beta of iPadOS 17. As of the Release Candidate, it is still present.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\nCreate a shortcut that converts a markdown-formatted list of hyperlinks to Rich Text using the native `Rich Text from Markdown` action. Add an `Append to Note` Apple Notes action using the output of the `Rich Text from Markdown` action's output as input, acting on any Apple Note.\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\nA correctly-formatted Apple Note with working hyperlinks in an unordered list.\r\n\r\nActual output:\r\nThe attached screenshot as well as this shared Apple Note: https://www.icloud.com/notes/0f8Ny0OULvPoDNwhIq5RW-q_w#Safari_Tabs_09142023-233320"
