    description: "I was testing onChange(of:initial:) and noticed something strange. The definition of initial means once and the first. However with initial=true I noticed it being called repeatedly. I also noticed if the value changes it can be called before the initial time of the screen appearing, so it is not even the initial.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that initial=true is actually causing the action to be called every time the View appears and has nothing to do with the value so I would suggesting renaming this API to:\r\n\r\nonChange(of:onAppear:) or onChange(of:andOnAppear:)\r\n\r\nAnother way to clear this up would have been to add a new onAppear(id:) modifier that is called on the appear and when the value changes which aligns with the task(id:) modifier we are already familiar with then you wouldn't have had to deprecate the old onChange(of:)"
