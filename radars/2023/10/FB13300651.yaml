    description: When switching a 3-party keyboard on iOS 17 the input field renders first in the correct place, then displaced above its correct position, then back down in the correct place. It is very fast and creates a glitchy jump for the keyboard UIs. An example where it's clear is using the Giphy Keyboard, but this happens for all 3party keyboards. It can even be reproduced in the iOS sim for iOS17, but not for iOS15.4 so it definitely seems like an OS bug.
