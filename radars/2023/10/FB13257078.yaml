    description: With the file provided XCTestCase case cause a deadlock for the functionality being tested. This deadlock is intermittent and requires running it repeatedly for it to happen and in some cases being run on a less powerful device like an iPhone. I believe the reason why this is happening is because XCTestCase is blocking any execution from happening on the main thread when the test function is asynchronous. The workaround for this is to mark everything to be run on the main thread but that could prevent parallel execution.
