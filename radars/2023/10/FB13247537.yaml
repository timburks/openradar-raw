    description: "There is a bug behaving differently when using String Catalog and strings file.\r\n\r\nChinese has 4 variations: \r\ni. Chinese (Cantonese - China mainland) \r\nii. Chinese (Cantonese - Hong Kong) \r\niii. Chinese (Mandarin - China mainland)\r\nIv. Chinese (Mandarin - Taiwan)\r\n\r\nWhen using String Catalog,\r\n1. The phrase ‘Say’ is not localized in all 4 variations.\r\n2. When choosing Chinese (Cantonese - Hong Kong) as the Siri language, it shows translation of Chinese (Simplified) instead of Chinese (Hong Kong).\r\n3. When choosing Chinese (Mandarin - Taiwan) as the Siri language, it shows translation of Chinese (Simplified) instead of Chinese (Traditional).\r\n\r\nWhen using strings file, \r\nThe translation simply doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\nNote: The above cases all work normally if we're targeting Russian so it should not be an issue of the configurations. \r\n\r\nSample project: https://github.com/startover205/RadarAppShortcuts"
