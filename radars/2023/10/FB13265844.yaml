    description: "Basic Information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nClockFace crashes\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nWatch Face\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDetails\r\nAre you seeing an issue with a Watch Face or a Complication?\r\nWatch Face\r\nWhat was the selected face?\r\nThe problem is present with every watch face.\r\nCan you provide a video or picture of your Watch Face issue?\r\nYes\r\nHow often does this issue occur?\r\nSometimes\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nDear watchOS Engineering Team,\r\n\r\nI wish to report a recurring issue I've been experiencing with my Apple Watch, related to the ClockFace process responsible for rendering the watch face.\r\n\r\nProblem Details:\r\nThe ClockFace process consistently crashes, leading to an endless loop wherein the process tries to restart itself repeatedly. This behaviour renders my Apple Watch nearly unusable while the error persists. The watch face fails to display correctly, and the device becomes largely unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRegrettably, I haven't pinpointed a specific sequence of actions that triggers the error. However, after rebooting the Apple Watch, the problem resurfaces shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\nI've observed multiple log files generated specifically for the ClockFace process at close timestamps, suggesting that the process is repeatedly crashing and restarting. I've attached a screenshot for reference.\r\n\r\nAttempted Solutions:\r\nI've tried turning the Apple Watch off and on again, but the issue persists.\r\n\r\nI hope this information assists in identifying and addressing the problem. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to a prompt resolution."
